Three gulls wheel above the broken boxes, orange-rinds,
spoiled cabbage heads that heave between the splintered

plank walls, the green waves spume under the round bow

water, slides, settles slowly into the slip

On the ferry there was an old man playing the violin* He had a
monkey’s face puckered up in one corner and kept time with the
toe of a cracked patent-leather shoe. Bud Korpenning sat on the rail
watching him, his back to the river. The breeze made the hair
siir round the tight line of his cap and dried the sweat on his
temples His feet were blistered, he was leaden-tired, but when the
ferry moved out of the slip, bucking the little slajiping scalloped
waves of the river he felt something warm and tingling shoot
suddenly through all his veins. '‘Say, friend, how fur is it into the

“Walk cast a block and turn down Broadway and you’ll find the

“Thank you sir. I’ll do that."
The violinist was going through the crowd with his hat held out,
the wind ruffling the wisps of grey^^ hair on his shabby bald head

Bud found the face tilted up at hifji, the crushed eyes like two black
pins looking into his. “Nothin’,” he said gruffly and turned away
to look at the expanse of river bright as knife-blades. The plank
walls of the slip closed in, cracked as the ferry lurched against

them; there was rattling of chains, and Bud was pushed forward
among the crowd through the ferryhouse. He walked between two
coal wagons and out over a dusty expanse of street towards yellow
street cars. A trembling took hold of nis knees. He thrust his hands
deep in his pockets.

“Fried eggs and a cup o’ coffee.”
“Want ’em turned over^” asked the red-haired man behind the
counter who was wiping off his beefy freckled foiearms with his
apron. Bud Korpenning sat up with a start.

“What?”
“The eggs? Want ’em turned over or sunny side up?”
“Oh sure, turn ’em over.” Bud slouched over the counter again
with his head between his hands.
“You look all in, feller,” the man said as he broke the eggs into
the sizzling grease of the frying pan.

“Came down from upstate. I walked fifteen miles this mormn’ ”
The man made a whistling sound through his eye-teeth “Cornin'

Bud nodded. The man flopped the eggs sizzling and netted with
brown out on to the plate and pushed it towards Bud with some
bread and butter on the edge of it. “I’m goin’ to slip you a bit
of advice, feller, and it won’t cost you nutten. You go an’ git a shave

A small beaj^ded bandy-legged man in a derby walked up Allen
up the sun-striped tunnel hung with sky-blue and smokedsalmon and mustard-yellow quilts, littered with second-hand gmgerbread-colourcd furniture. He walked with his cold hands clasped
over the tails of his frockcoat, picking his way among packing
boxes and scuttling children. He kept gnawing his hps and clasping
and unclasping his hands. He walked without hearing the yells of
the children or the annihilating clatter of the L trains overhead or
smelling the rancid sweet huddled smell of packed tenements.
At a yellow-painted drugstore at the corner of Canal> he stopped
and staled abstractedly at a face on a greet! advertising card. It
was a high-browed clean-shaven distinguished face with arched
eyebrows and a bushy neatly trimmed moustache, t^ie face of a man
who had money in the bank, pedsed prosperously above a crisp
wing collar and an ample dark cravat. Under it in copy-book
writing was the signature King C. Gillette. Above his head hovered
the motto no stropping no honing. The little bearded man pushed
his derby back off his sweating brow and looked for a long time
