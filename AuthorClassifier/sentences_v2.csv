Hemingway,"In the sentry box that faced toward them up the road, the sentry was sitting holding his rifle, the bayonet fixed, between his knees."
Hemingway,He was smoking a cigarette and he wore a knitted cap and blanket style cape.
Hemingway,"At fifty yards, you could not see anything about his face."
Hemingway,"Robert put up his field glasses, shading the lenses carefully with his cupped hands even though there was now no sun to make a glint, and there was the rail of the bridge as clear as though you could reach out and touch it and there was the face of the sentry so clear he could see the sunken cheeks, the ash on the cigarette and the greasy shine of the bayonet."
Hemingway,"It was a peasant's face, the cheeks hollow under the high cheekbones, the beard stubbled, the eyes shaded by the heavy brows, big hands holding the rifle, heavy boots showing beneath the folds of the blanket cape."
Hemingway,"There was a worn, blackened leather wine bottle on the wall of the sentry box, there were some newspapers and there was no telephone."
Hemingway,"There could, of course, be a telephone on the side he could not see; but there were no wires running from the box that were visible."
Hemingway,A telephone line ran along the road and its wires were carried over the bridge.
Hemingway,"There was a charcoal brazier outside the box, made from an old petrol tin with the top cut off and holes punched in it, which rested on two stones; but he held no fire."
Hemingway,There were some fire-blackened empty tins in the ashes under it.
Hemingway,Robert Jordan handed the glasses to Anselmo who lay flat beside him.
Hemingway,The old man grinned and shook his head.
Hemingway,He tapped his skull beside his eye with one finger.
Hemingway,"""Ya io veo,"" he said in Spanish."
Hemingway,"""I have seen him,"" speaking from the front of his mouth with almost no movement of his lips in the way that is quieter than any whisper."
Hemingway,"He looked at the sentry as Robert Jordan smiled at him and, pointing with one finger, drew the other across his throat."
Hemingway,Robert Jordan nodded but he did not smile.
Hemingway,The sentry box at the far end of the bridge faced away from them and down the road and they could not see into it.
Hemingway,"The road, which was broad and oiled and well constructed, made a turn to the left at the far end of the bridge and then swung out of sight around a curve to the right."
Hemingway,"At this point it was enlarged from the old road to its present width by cutting into the solid bastion of the rock on the far side of the gorge; and its left or western edge, looking down from the pass and the bridge, was marked and protected by a line of upright cut blocks of stone where its edge fell sheer away to the gorge."
Hemingway,"The gorge was almost a canyon here, where the brook, that the bridge was flung over, merged with the main stream of the pass."
Hemingway,He was watching the sentry again with his glasses.
Hemingway,"The sentry rubbed his cigarette out on the plank wall of the box, then took a leather tobacco pouch from his  pocket, opened the paper of the dead cigarette and emptied the remnant of used tobacco into the pouch."
Hemingway,"The sentry stood up, leaned his rifle against the wall of the box and stretched, picked up his rifle, slung it over his shoulder and walked out onto the bridge."
Hemingway,Anselmo flattened on the ground and Robert Jordan slipped his glasses into his shirt pocket and put his head well behind the pine tree.
Hemingway,"The sentry was standing, his back toward them, at the far end of the bridge."
Hemingway,From the gorge came the noise of the stream in the boulders.
Hemingway,"Then through this noise came another noise, a steady, racketing drone and they saw the sentry looking up, his knitted cap slanted back, and turning their heads and looking up they saw, high in the evening sky, three monoplanes in V formation, showing minute and silvery at that height where there still was sun, passing unbelievably quickly across the sky, their motors now throbbing steadily."
Hemingway,Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton.
Hemingway,"Do not think that I am very much impressed by that as a boxing title, but it meant a lot to Cohn."
Hemingway,"He cared nothing for boxing, in fact he disliked it, but he learned it painfully and thoroughly to counteract the feeling of inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew at Princeton."
Hemingway,"There was a certain inner comfort in knowing he could knock down anybody who was snooty to him, although, being very shy and a thoroughly nice boy, he never fought except in the gym."
Hemingway,"Spider Kelly taught all his young gentlemen to box like featherweights, no matter whether they weighed one hundred and five or two hundred and five pounds."
Hemingway,He was so good that Spider promptly overmatched him and got his nose permanently flattened.
Hemingway,"This increased Cohn’s distaste for boxing, but it gave him a certain satisfaction of some strange sort, and it certainly improved his nose."
Hemingway,In his last year at Princeton he readtoo much and took to wearing spectacles.
Hemingway,I never met any one of his class who remembered him.
Hemingway,They did not even remember that he was middleweight boxing champion.
Hemingway,"I mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories hold together, and I always had a suspicion that perhaps Robert Cohn had never been middleweight boxing champion, and that perhaps a horse had stepped on his face, or that maybe his mother had been frightened or seen something, or that he had, maybe, bumped into something as a young child, but I finally had somebody verify the story from Spider Kelly."
Hemingway,Spider Kelly not only remembered Cohn.
Hemingway,He had often wondered what hadbecome of him.
Hemingway,"Robert Cohn was a member, through his father, of one of the richest Jewish families in New York, and through his mother of one of the oldest."
Hemingway,"At the military school where he prepped for Princeton, and played a very good end on the football team, no one had made him race-conscious."
Hemingway,"No one had ever made him feel he was a Jew, and hence any different from anybody else, until he went to Princeton."
Hemingway,"He was a nice boy, a friendly boy, and very shy, and it made him bitter."
Hemingway,"He took it out in boxing, and he came out of Princeton with painful self-consciousness and the flattened nose, and was married by the first girl who was nice to him."
Hemingway,"He was married five years, had three children, lost most of the fifty thousand dollars his father left him, the balance of the estate having gone to his mother, hardened into a rather unattractive mould under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife; and just when he had made up his mind to leave his wife she left him and went off with a miniature-painter."
Hemingway,"As he had been thinking for months about leaving his wife and had not done it because it would be too cruel to deprive her of himself, her departure was a very healthful shock."
Lawrence,Connie helped him as much as she could.
Lawrence,At first she was thrilled.
Lawrence,"He talked everything over with her monotonously, insistently, persistently, and she had to respond with all her might."
Lawrence,It was as if her whole soul and body and sex had to rouse up and pass into theme stories of his.
Lawrence,This thrilled her and absorbed her.
Lawrence,Of physical life they lived very little.
Lawrence,She had to superintend the house.
Lawrence,"But the housekeeper had served Sir Geoffrey for many years, and the dried-up, elderly, superlatively correct female you could hardly call her a parlour-maid, or even a woman...who waited at table, had been in the house for forty years."
Lawrence,Even the very housemaids were no longer young.
Lawrence,"It was awful! What could you do with such a place, but leave it alone! All these endless rooms that nobody used, all the Midlands routine, the mechanical cleanliness and the mechanical order! Clifford had insisted on a new cook, an experienced woman who had served him in his rooms in London."
Lawrence,For the rest the place seemed run by mechanical anarchy.
Lawrence,"Everything went on in pretty good order, strict cleanliness, and strict punctuality; even pretty strict honesty."
Lawrence,"And yet, to Connie, it was a methodical anarchy."
Lawrence,No warmth of feeling united it organically.
Lawrence,The house seemed as dreary as a disused street.
Lawrence,What could she do but leave it alone?
Lawrence,So she left it alone.
Lawrence,"Miss Chatterley came sometimes, with her aristocratic thin face, and triumphed, finding nothing altered."
Lawrence,She would never forgive Connie for ousting her from her union in consciousness with her brother.
Lawrence,"It was she, Emma, who should be bringing forth the stories, these books, with him; the Chatterley stories, something new in the world, that THEY, the Chatterleys, had put there."
Lawrence,There was no other standard.
Lawrence,There was no organic connexion with the thought and expression that had gone before.
Lawrence,"Only something new in the world: the Chatterley books, entirely personal."
Lawrence,"Connie's father, where he paid a flying visit to Wragby, and in private to his daughter: As for Clifford's writing, it's smart, but there's NOTHING IN IT."
Lawrence,"It won't last! Connie looked at the burly Scottish knight who had done himself well all his life, and her eyes, her big, still-wondering blue eyes became vague."
Lawrence,Nothing in it! What did he mean by nothing in it?
Lawrence,"If the critics praised it, and Clifford's name was almost famous, and it even brought in money...what did her father mean by saying there was nothing in Clifford's writing?"
Lawrence,What else could there be?
Lawrence,"The Brangwens went home to Beldover, the wedding-party gathered at Shortlands, the Criches' home."
Lawrence,"It was a long, low old house, a sort of manor farm, that spread along the top of a slope just beyond the narrow little lake of Willey Water."
Lawrence,"Shortlands looked across a sloping meadow that might be a park, because of the large, solitary trees that stood here and there, across the water of the narrow lake, at the wooded hill that successfully hid the colliery valley beyond, but did not quite hide the rising smoke."
Lawrence,"Nevertheless, the scene was rural and picturesque, very peaceful, and the house had a charm of its own."
Lawrence,It was crowded now with the family and the wedding guests.
Lawrence,"The father, who was not well, withdrew to rest."
Lawrence,Gerald was host.
Lawrence,"He stood in the homely entrance hall, friendly and easy, attending to the men."
Lawrence,"He seemed to take pleasure in his social functions, he smiled, and was abundant in hospitality."
Lawrence,"The women wandered about in a little confusion, chased hither and thither by the three married daughters of the house."
Lawrence,"All the while there could be heard the characteristic, imperious voice of one Crich woman or another calling 'Helen, come here a minute,' 'Marjory, I want you--here.' 'Oh, I say, Mrs Witham--.' There was a great rustling of skirts, swift glimpses of smartly-dressed women, a child danced through the hall and back again, a maidservant came and went hurriedly."
Lawrence,"Meanwhile the men stood in calm little groups, chatting, smoking, pretending to pay no heed to the rustling animation of the women's world."
Lawrence,"But they could not really talk, because of the glassy ravel of women's excited, cold laughter and running voices."
Lawrence,"They waited, uneasy, suspended, rather bored."
Lawrence,"But Gerald remained as if genial and happy, unaware that he was waiting or unoccupied, knowing himself the very pivot of the occasion."
Lawrence,"They felt the rush of the sap in spring, they knew the wave which cannot halt, but every year throws forward the seed to begetting, and, falling back, leaves the young-born on the earth."
Lawrence,"They knew the intercourse between heaven and earth, sunshine drawn into the breast and bowels, the rain sucked up in the daytime, nakedness that comes under the wind in autumn, showing the birds' nests no longer worth hiding."
Wharton, Before my own time there was up I had learned to know what that meant.
Wharton,"Yet I had come in the degenerate day of trolley, bicycle and rural delivery, when communication was easy between the scattered mountain villages, and the bigger towns in the valleys, such as Bettsbridge and Shadd's Falls, had libraries, theatres and Y.M.C.A."
Wharton,halls to which the youth of the hills could descend for recreation.
Wharton,"But when winter shut down on Starkfield and the village lay under a sheet of snow perpetually renewed from the pale skies, I began to see what life there--or rather its negation--must have been in Ethan Frome's young manhood."
Wharton,"I had been sent up by my employers on a job connected with the big power-house at Corbury Junction, and a long-drawn carpenters' strike had so delayed the work that I found myself anchored at Starkfield--the nearest habitable spot--for the best part of the winter."
Wharton,"I chafed at first, and then, under the hypnotising effect of routine, gradually began to find a grim satisfaction in the life."
Wharton,During the early part of my stay I had been struck by the contrast between the vitality of the climate and the deadness of the community.
Wharton,"Day by day, after the December snows were over, a blazing blue sky poured down torrents of light and air on the white landscape, which gave them back in an intenser glitter."
Wharton,One would have supposed that such an atmosphere must quicken the emotions as well as the blood; but it seemed to produce no change except that of retarding still more the sluggish pulse of Starkfield.
Wharton,"When I had been there a little longer, and had seen this phase of crystal clearness followed by long stretches of sunless cold; when the storms of February had pitched their white tents about the devoted village and the wild cavalry of March winds had charged down to their support; I began to understand why Starkfield emerged from its six months' siege like a starved garrison capitulating without quarter."
Wharton,"Twenty years earlier the means of resistance must have been far fewer, and the enemy in command of almost all the lines of access between the beleaguered villages; and, considering these things, I felt the sinister force of Harmon's phrase: “Most of the smart ones get away.” But if that were the case, how could any combination of obstacles have hindered the flight of a man like Ethan Frome?"
Wharton,During my stay at Starkfield I lodged with a middle-aged widow colloquially known as Mrs. Ned Hale.
Wharton,"Mrs. Hale's father had been the village lawyer of the previous generation, and “lawyer Varnum's house,”  where my landlady still lived with her mother, was the most considerable mansion in the village."
Wharton,"It stood at one end of the main street, its classic portico and small-paned windows looking down a flagged path between Norway spruces to the slim white steeple of the Congregational church."
Wharton,"It was clear that the Varnum fortunes were at the ebb, but the two women did what they could to preserve a decent dignity; and Mrs. Hale, in particular, had a certain wan refinement not out of keeping with her pale old-fashioned house."
Wharton,"In the “best parlour,” with its black horse-hair and mahogany weakly illuminated by a gurgling Carcel lamp, I listened every evening to another and more delicately shaded version of the Starkfield chronicle."
Wharton,It was not that Mrs. Ned Hale felt
Wharton,"She was not unwilling to exercise this faculty, and I had great hopes of getting from her the missing facts of Ethan Frome's story, or rather such a key to his character as should co-ordinate the facts I knew."
Wharton,Her mind was a store-house of innocuous anecdote and any question about her acquaintances brought forth a volume of detail; but on the subject of Ethan Frome I found her unexpectedly reticent.
Wharton,"There was no hint of disapproval in her reserve; I merely felt in her an insurmountable reluctance to speak of him or his affairs, a low “Yes, I knew them both..."
Wharton,it was awful...” seeming to be the utmost concession that her distress could make to my curiosity.
Wharton,"So marked was the change in her manner, such depths of sad initiation did it imply, that, with some doubts as to my delicacy, I put the case anew to my village oracle, Harmon Gow; but got for my pains only an uncomprehending grunt."
Wharton,"“Ruth Varnum was always as nervous as a rat; and, come to think of it, she was the first one to see 'em after they was picked up."
Wharton,"It happened right below lawyer Varnum's, down at the bend of the Corbury road, just round about the time that Ruth got engaged to Ned Hale."
Wharton,"The young folks was all friends, and I guess she just can't bear to talk about it."
Wharton,"She's had troubles enough of her own.”  All the dwellers in Starkfield, as in more notable communities, had had troubles enough of their own to make them comparatively indifferent to those of their neighbours; and though all conceded that Ethan Frome's had been beyond the common measure, no one gave me an explanation of the look in his face which, as I persisted in thinking, neither poverty nor physical suffering could have put there."
Wharton,"Nevertheless, I might have contented myself with the story pieced together from these hints had it not been for the provocation of Mrs."
Wharton,"Hale's silence, and--a little later--for the accident of personal contact with the man."
Wharton,He did not in the least wish the future Mrs.
Wharton,Newland Archer to be a simpleton.
Wharton,"He meant her (thanks to his enlightening companionship) to develop a social tact and readiness of wit enabling her to hold her own with the most popular married women of the ""younger set,"" in which it was the recognised custom to attract masculine homage while playfully discouraging it."
Wharton,"If he had probed to the bottom of his vanity (as he sometimes nearly did) he would have found there the wish that his wife should be as worldly-wise and as eager to please as the married lady whose charms had held his fancy through two mildly agitated years; without, of course, any hint of the frailty which had so nearly marred that unhappy being's life, and had disarranged his own plans for a whole winter."
Wharton,"How this miracle of fire and ice was to be created, and to sustain itself in a harsh world, he had never taken the time to think out; but he was content to hold his view without analysing it, since he knew it was that of all the carefully-brushed, white-waistcoated, button-hole-flowered gentlemen who succeeded each other in the club box, exchanged friendly greetings with him, and turned their opera-glasses critically on the circle of ladies who were the product of the system."
Wharton,"In matters intellectual and artistic Newland Archer felt himself distinctly the superior of these chosen specimens of old New York gentility; he had probably read more, thought more, and even seen a good deal more of the world, than any other man of the number."
Wharton,"Singly they betrayed their inferiority; but grouped together they represented ""New York,"" and the habit of masculine solidarity made him accept their doctrine on all the issues called moral."
Wharton,He instinctively felt that in this respect it would be troublesome--and also rather bad form--to strike out for himself.
Wharton,"But they had; they undoubtedly had; for the low-toned comments behind him left no doubt in Archer's mind that the young woman was May Welland's cousin, the cousin always referred to in the family as ""poor Ellen Olenska.""  Archer knew that she had suddenly arrived from Europe a day or two previously; he had even heard from Miss Welland (not disapprovingly) that she had been to see poor Ellen, who was staying with old Mrs. Mingott."
Wharton,"Archer entirely approved of family solidarity, and one of the qualities he most admired in the Mingotts was their resolute championship of the few black sheep that their blameless stock had produced."
Wharton,"There was nothing mean or ungenerous in the young man's heart, and he was glad that his future wife should not be restrained by false prudery from being kind (in private) to her unhappy cousin; but to receive Countess Olenska in the family circle was a different thing from producing her in public, at the Opera of all places, and in the very box with the young girl whose engagement to him, Newland Archer, was to be announced within a few weeks."
Wharton,"No, he felt as old Sillerton Jackson felt; he did not think the Mingotts would have tried it on! "
Fitzgerald,"He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that."
Fitzgerald,"In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores."
Fitzgerald,"The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret grief’s of wild, unknown men."
Fitzgerald,"Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions."
Fitzgerald,Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope.
Fitzgerald,"I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parceled out unequally at birth."
Fitzgerald,"And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit."
Fitzgerald,"Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on."
Fitzgerald,When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart.
Fitzgerald,"Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn."
Fitzgerald,"If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him; some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away."
Fitzgerald,"This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again."
Fitzgerald,"No—Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men."
Fitzgerald,"We drove for a long time over a bright level countryside, just a road and a tree and a shack and a tree, and then suddenly along a winding twist of woodland."
Fitzgerald,I could feel even in the darkness that the trees of the woodland were green-— that it was all different from the dusty olive-tint of California.
Fitzgerald,"Somewhere we passed a negro driving three cows ahead of him, and they mooed as he scatted them to the side of the road."
Fitzgerald,"They were real cows, with warm, fresh, silky flanks, and the negro grew gradually real out of the darkness with his big brown eyes staring at us close to the car, as Wylie gave him  “Let’s all ask for our money back,” he suggested."
Fitzgerald,"His dark eyes took me in, and I wondered what they would look like if he fell in love."
Fitzgerald,"They were kind, aloof and, though they often reasoned with you gently, somewhat superior."
Fitzgerald,It was no fault of theirs if they saw He darted in and out of the role of “one of the boys” with dexterity—but on the whole I should say he wasn’t one of them.
Fitzgerald,"But he knew how to shut up, how to draw into the background, how to listen."
Fitzgerald,"From where he stood (and though he was not a tall man, it always seemed high up) he watched the multitudinous practicalities of his world like a proud young shepherd to whom night and day had never mattered."
Fitzgerald,"He was born sleepless, without a talent so much."
Fitzgerald,"We sat in unembarrassed silence—I had known him since he became Father’s partner a dozen years ago, when I was seven and Stahr was twenty-two."
Fitzgerald,"Wylie was across the aisle and I didn’t know whether or not to introduce them, but Stahr kept turning his ring so abstractedly that he made me feel young and invisible, and I didn’t dare."
Fitzgerald,"I never dared look quite away from him or quite at him, unless I had something important to say—and I knew he affected many other people in the same manner."
Fitzgerald,"Indeed, of all the region only the beach stirred with activity."
Fitzgerald,"Three British nannies sat knitting the slow pattern of Victorian England, the pattern of the forties, the sixties, and the eighties, into sweaters and socks, to the tune of gossip as formalized as incantation; closer to the sea a dozen persons kept house under striped umbrellas, while their dozen children pursued unintimidated fish through the shallows or lay naked and glistening with cocoanut oil out in the sun."
Fitzgerald,As Rosemary came onto the beach a boy of twelve ran past her and dashed into the sea with exultant cries.
Fitzgerald,"Feeling the impactive scrutiny of strange faces, she took off her bathrobe and followed."
Fitzgerald,"She floated face down for a few yards and find- ing it shallow staggered to her feet and plodded forward, dragging slim legs like weights against the resistance of the water."
Fitzgerald,"When it was about breast high, she glanced back toward shore: a bald man in a monocle and a pair of tights, his tufted chest thrown out, his brash navel sucked in, was regarding her attentively."
Fitzgerald,"As Rosemary returned the gaze the man dis- lodged the monocle, which went into hiding amid the facetious whiskers of his chest, and poured himself a glass of something from a bottle in his hand."
Fitzgerald,Rosemary laid her face on the water and swam a choppy little four-beat crawl out to the raft.
Fitzgerald,"The water reached up for her, pulled her down tenderly out of the heat, seeped in her hair and ran into the comers of her body."
Fitzgerald,"She turned round and round in it, embracing it, wallowing in it."
Fitzgerald,"Reaching the raft she was out of breath, but a tanned woman with very white teeth looked down at her, and Rosemary, suddenly conscious of the raw whiteness of her own body, turned on her back and drifted toward shore."
Fitzgerald,The hairy man holding the bottle spoke to her as she came out.
Fitzgerald,"Amory Blaine inherited from his mother every trait, except the stray inexpressible few, that made him worthwhile."
Fitzgerald,"His father, an ineffectual, inarticulate man with a taste for Byron and a habit of drowsing over the Encyclopedia Britannica, grew wealthy at thirty through the death of two elder brothers, successful Chicago brokers, and in the first flush of feeling that the world was his, went to Bar Harbor and met Beatrice O’Hara."
Fitzgerald,"In consequence, Stephen Blaine handed down to posterity his height of just under six feet and his tendency to waver at crucial moments, these two abstractions appearing in his son Amory."
Fitzgerald,"For many years he hovered in the background of his family’s life, an unassertive figure with a face half-obliterated by lifeless, silky hair, continually occupied in “taking care” of his wife, continually harassed by the idea that he didn’t and couldn’t understand her."
Fitzgerald,"But Beatrice Blaine! There was a woman! Early pictures taken on her father’s estate at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, or in Rome at the Sacred Heart Convent—an educational extravagance that in her youth was only for the daughters of the exceptionally wealthy—showed the exquisite delicacy of her features, the consummate art and simplicity of her clothes."
Fitzgerald,"A brilliant education she had—her youth passed in renaissance glory, she was versed in the latest gossip of the Older Roman Families; known by name as a fabulously wealthy American girl to Cardinal Vitori and Queen Margherita and more subtle celebrities that one must have had some culture even to have heard of."
Fitzgerald,"She learned in England to prefer whiskey and soda to wine, and her small talk was broadened in two senses during a winter in Vienna."
Fitzgerald,"All in all Beatrice O’Hara absorbed the sort of education that will be quite impossible ever again; a tutelage measured by the number of things and people one could be contemptuous of and charming about; a culture rich in all arts and traditions, barren of all ideas, in the last of those days when the great gardener clipped the inferior roses to produce one perfect bud."
Fitzgerald,The sixty acres of the estate were dotted with old and new summer houses and many fountains and white benches that came suddenly into sight from foliage-hung hiding-places; there was a great and constantly increasing family of white cats that prowled the many flowerbeds and were silhouetted suddenly at night against the darkening trees.
Fitzgerald,"It was on one of the shadowy paths that Beatrice at last captured Amory, after Mr. Blaine had, as usual, retired for the evening to his private library."
Fitzgerald,"After reproving him for avoiding her, she took him for a long tête-à-tête in the moonlight."
Fitzgerald,"He could not reconcile himself to her beauty, that was mother to his own, the exquisite neck and shoulders, the grace of a fortunate woman of thirty."
Austen,"In respect of her art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observed that “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it, combined with the narrowness of her field;” and he has justly added that we need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature painter."
Austen,"To make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the term miniature in its restricted sense, and must think rather of Memling at one end of the history of painting and Meissonier at the other, than of Cosway or any of his kind."
Austen,And I am not so certain that I should myself use the word “narrow” in connection with her.
Austen,"If her world is a microcosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the littleness."
Austen,She does not touch what she did not feel herself called to paint; I am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not feel herself called to touch.
Austen,"It is at least remarkable that in two very short periods of writing--one of about three years, and another of not much more than five--she executed six capital works, and has not left a single failure."
Austen,It is possible that the romantic paste in her composition was defective: we must always remember that hardly anybody born in her decade--that of the eighteenth-century seventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality.
Austen,"Even Scott required hill and mountain and ballad, even Coleridge metaphysics and German to enable them to chip the classical shell."
Austen,"Miss Austen was an English girl, brought up in a country retirement, at the time when ladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might pierce their kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subject of the gravest fears, when their studies, their ways, their conduct were subject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which Mary Wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular taste or judgment."
Austen,"Miss Austen, too, drew back when the white frost touched her shoes; but I think she would have made a pretty good journey even in a black one."
Austen,"No sooner was his father’s funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood, without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law, arrived with her child and their attendants."
Austen,"No one could dispute her right to come; the house was her husband’s from the moment of his father’s decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater, and to a woman in Mrs."
Austen,"Dashwood’s situation, with only common feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;—but in _her_ mind there was a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence of the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source of immovable disgust."
Austen,"Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with any of her husband’s family; but she had had no opportunity, till the present, of showing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it."
Austen,"So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so earnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it, that, on the arrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, had not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother."
Austen,"Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs."
Austen,Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence.
Austen,"She had an excellent heart;—her disposition was affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught."
Austen,The event had every promise of happiness for her friend.
Austen,"Mr. Weston was a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match; but it was a black morning’s work for her."
Austen,The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day.
Austen,"She recalled her past kindness—the kindness, the affection of sixteen years—how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old—how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health—and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood."
Austen,"A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella’s marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection."
Austen,"She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of hers—one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault."
Austen,How was she to bear the change?
Austen,It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs.
Austen,"Weston, only half a mile from them, and a Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude."
Austen,"She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her."
Austen,"He could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful."
Faulkner,"When the shadow of the sash appeared on the curtains it was between seven and eight o'clock and then I was in time again, hearing the watch."
Faulkner,It was Grandfather's and when Father gave it to me he said I give you the mausoleum of all hope and desire; it's rather excruciatingly apt that you will use it to gain the reductio ad absurdum of all human experience which can fit your individual needs no better than it fitted his or his father's.
Faulkner,"I give it to you not that you may remember time, but that you might forget it now and then for a moment and not spend all your breath trying to conquer it."
Faulkner,Because no battle is ever won he said.
Faulkner,They are not even fought.
Faulkner,"The field only reveals to man his own folly and despair, and victory is an illusion of philosophers and fools."
Faulkner,It was propped against the collar box and I lay listening to it.
Faulkner,"Hearing it, that is."
Faulkner,I don't suppose anybody ever deliberately listens to a watch or a clock.
Faulkner,You don't have to.
Faulkner,"You can be oblivious to the sound for a long while, then in a second of ticking it can create in the mind unbroken the long diminishing parade of time you didn't hear."
Faulkner,"Like Father said down the long and lonely light-rays you might see Jesus walking, like."
Faulkner,"And the good Saint Francis that said Little Sister Death, that never had a sister."
Faulkner,Through the wall I heard Shreve's bed-springs and then his slippers on the floor hishing.
Faulkner,I got up and went to the dresser and slid my hand along it and touched the watch and turned it face-down and went back to bed.
Faulkner,"But the shadow of the sash was still there and I had learned to tell almost to the minute, so I'd have to turn my back to it, feeling the eyes animals used to have in the back of their heads when it was on top, itching."
Faulkner,It's always the idle habits you acquire which you will regret.
Faulkner,Father said that.
Faulkner,That Christ was not crucified: he was worn away by a minute clicking of little wheels.
Faulkner,That had no sister.
Faulkner,"And so as soon as I knew I couldn't see it, I began to wonder what time it was."
Faulkner,Father said that constant speculation regarding the position of mechanical hands on an arbitrary dial which is a symptom of mind-function.
Faulkner,Excrement Father said like sweating.
Faulkner,And I saying All right.
Faulkner,Wonder.
Faulkner,Go on and wonder.
Faulkner,There were perhaps five families there when Lena arrived.
Faulkner,"There was a track and a station, and once a day a mixed train fled shrieking through it."
Faulkner,"The train could be stopped with a red flag, but by ordinary it appeared out of the devastated hills with apparitionlike suddenness and wailing like a banshee, athwart and past that little less-than-village like a forgotten bead from a broken string."
Faulkner,The brother was twenty years her senior.
Faulkner,She hardly remembered him at all when she came to live with him.
Faulkner,He lived in a four room and unpainted house with his labor- and child-ridden wife.
Faulkner,For almost half of every year the sister-in-law was either lying in or recovering.
Faulkner,During this time Lena did all the housework and took care of the other children.
Faulkner,"Later she, told herself, ‘I reckon that’s why I got one so quick myself.’  She slept in a lean-to room at the back of the house."
Faulkner,"It had a window which she learned to open and close again in the dark without making a sound, even though there also slept in the lean-to room at first her oldest nephew and then the two oldest and then the three."
Faulkner,She had lived there eight years before she opened the window for the first time.
Faulkner,She had not opened it a dozen times hardly before she discovered that she should not have opened it at all.
Faulkner,"She said to herself, ‘That’s just my luck.’  The sister-in-law told the brother."
Faulkner,"Then he remarked her changing shape, which he should have noticed some time before."
Faulkner,He was a hard man.
Faulkner,Softness and gentleness and youth (he was just forty) and almost everything else except a kind of stubborn and despairing fortitude and the bleak heritage of his bloodpride had been sweated out of him.
Faulkner,He called her whore.
Faulkner,"He accused the right man (young bachelors, or sawdust Casanovas anyway, were even fewer in number than families) but she would not admit it, though the man had departed six months ago."
Faulkner,"She just repeated stubbornly, “He’s going to send for me."
Faulkner,"He said he would send for me”; unshakable, sheeplike, having drawn upon that reserve of patient and steadfast fidelity upon which the Lucas Burches depend and trust, even though they do not intend to be present when the need for it arises."
Faulkner,Two weeks later she climbed again through the window.
Faulkner, And at night it is better still.
Faulkner,"I used to lie on the pallet in the hall, waiting until I could hear them all asleep, so I could get up and go back to the bucket."
Faulkner,"It would be black, the shelf black, the still surface of the water a round orifice in nothingness, where before I stirred it awake with the dipper I could see maybe a star or two in the bucket, and maybe in the dipper a star or two before I drank."
Faulkner,"After that I was bigger, older."
Faulkner,"Then I would wait until they all went to sleep so I could lie with my shirt-tail up, hearing them asleep, feeling myself without touching myself, feeling the cool silence blowing upon my parts and wondering if Cash was yonder in the darkness doing it too, had been doing it perhaps for the last two years before I could have wanted to or could have."
Faulkner,"Pa's feet are badly splayed, his toes cramped and bent and warped, with no toenail at all on his little toes, from working so hard in the wet in homemade shoes when he was a boy."
Faulkner,Beside his chair his brogans sit.
Faulkner,They look as though they had been hacked with a blunt axe out of pig-iron.
Faulkner,Vernon has been to town.
Faulkner,I have never seen him go to town in overalls.
Faulkner,"His wife, they say."
Faulkner,"She taught school too, once."
Faulkner,I fling the dipper dregs to the ground and wipe my mouth on my sleeve.
Faulkner,It is going to rain before morning.
Faulkner,Maybe before dark.
Faulkner,"""Down to the barn,"" I say."
Faulkner,"""Harnessing the team.""  Down there fooling with that horse."
Faulkner,"He will go on through the barn, into the pasture."
Faulkner,"The horse will not be in sight: he is up there among the pine seedlings, in the cool."
Faulkner,"Jewel whistles, once and shrill."
Faulkner,"The horse snorts, then Jewel sees him, glinting for a gaudy instant among the blue shadows."
Faulkner,"Jewel whistles again; the horse comes dropping down the slope, stiff-legged, his ears cocking and flicking, his mis-matched eyes rolling, and fetches up twenty feet away, broadside on, watching Jewel over his shoulder in an attitude kittenish and alert."
Faulkner,"It's because she wants it told, he thought, so that people whom she will never see and whose names she will never hear and who have never heard her name nor seen her face will read it and know at last why God let us lose the war: that only through the blood of our men and the tears of our women could He slay this demon and efface his name and lineage from the earth."
Faulkner,"Then almost immediately he decided that neither was this the reason why she had sent the note, and sending it, why to him, since if she had merely wanted it told, written, and even printed, she would not have needed to call in anybody—a woman who even in his (Quentin's) father's youth had already established herself as the town's and the county's poetess laureate by issuing to the stern and meager subscription list of the county newspaper poems, ode, eulogy, and epitaph, out of some bitter and implacable reserve of undefeat."
Faulkner,"It would be three hours yet before he would learn why she had sent for him because part of it, the first part of it, Quentin already knew."
Faulkner,It was a part of his twenty years' heritage of breathing the same ai?
Faulkner,"and hearing his father talk about the man Sutpen; a part of the town's—Jefferson's—eighty years' heritage of the same air which the man himself had breathed between this September afternoon in 1909 and that Sunday morning in June in 1833 when he first rode into town out of no discernible past and acquired his land no one knew how and built his house, his mansion, apparently out of nothing and married Ellen Coldfield and begot his two children—the son who widowed the daughter who had not yet been a bride—and so accomplished his allotted course to its violent (Miss Coldfield at least would have said, just) end."
Faulkner,Quentin had grown up with that; the mere names were interchangeable and almost myriad.
Faulkner,"His childhood was full of them; his very body was an empty hall echoing with sonorous defeated names; he was not a being, an entity, he was a commonwealth."
Orwell,"By degrees they were issuing the recruits with uniforms, and because this was Spain everything was issued piecemeal, so that it was never quite certain who had received what, and various of the things we most needed, such as belts and cartridge-boxes, were not issued till the last moment, when the train was actually waiting to take us to the front."
Orwell,"I have spoken of the militia 'uniform', which probably gives a wrong impression."
Orwell,It was not exactly a uniform.
Orwell,Perhaps a 'multiform' would be the proper name for it.
Orwell,"Everyone's clothes followed the same general plan, but they were never quite the same in any two cases."
Orwell,"Practically everyone in the army wore corduroy knee-breeches, but there the uniformity ended."
Orwell,"Some wore puttees, others corduroy gaiters, others leather leggings or high boots."
Orwell,"Everyone wore a zipper jacket, but some of the jackets were of leather, others of wool and of every conceivable colour."
Orwell,The kinds of cap were about as numerous as their wearers.
Orwell,"It was usual to adorn the front of your cap with a party badge, and in addition nearly every man wore a red or red and black handkerchief round his throat."
Orwell,A militia column at that time was an extraordinary-looking rabble.
Orwell,"But the clothes had to be issued as this or that factory rushed them out, and they were not bad clothes considering the circumstances."
Orwell,"The shirts and socks were wretched cotton things, however, quite useless against cold."
Orwell,I hate to think of what the militiamen must have gone through in the earlier months before anything was organized.
Orwell,"I remember coming upon a newspaper of only about two months earlier in which one of the P.O.U.M. leaders, after a visit to the front, said that he would try to see to it that 'every militiaman had a blanket'."
Orwell,A phrase to make you shudder if you have ever slept in a trench.
Orwell,"At one end of the big barn, on a sort of raised platform, Major was already ensconced on his bed of straw, under a lantern which hung from a beam."
Orwell,"He was twelve years old and had lately grown rather stout, but he was still a majestic-looking pig, with a wise and benevolent appearance in spite of the fact that his tushes had never been cut."
Orwell,Before long the other animals began to arrive and make themselves comfortable after their different fashions.
Orwell,"First came the three dogs, Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher, and then the pigs, who settled down in the straw immediately in front of the platform."
Orwell,"The hens perched themselves on the window-sills, the pigeons fluttered up to the rafters, the sheep and cows lay down behind the pigs and began to chew the cud."
Orwell,"The two cart-horses, Boxer and Clover, came in together, walking very slowly and setting down their vast hairy hoofs with great care lest there should be some small animal concealed in the straw."
Orwell,"Clover was a stout motherly mare approaching middle life, who had never quite got her figure back after her fourth foal."
Orwell,"Boxer was an enormous beast, nearly eighteen hands high, and as strong as any two ordinary horses put together."
Orwell,"A white stripe down his nose gave him a somewhat stupid appearance, and in fact he was not of first-rate intelligence, but he was universally respected for his steadiness of character and tremendous powers of work."
Orwell,"After the horses came Muriel, the white goat, and Benjamin, the donkey."
Orwell,"Benjamin was the oldest animal on the farm, and the worst tempered."
Orwell,"He seldom talked, and when he did, it was usually to make some cynical remark--for instance, he would say that God had given him a tail to keep the flies off, but that he would sooner have had no tail and no flies."
Orwell,Alone among the animals on the farm he never laughed.
Orwell,"If asked why, he would say that he saw nothing to laugh at."
Orwell,"Nevertheless, without openly admitting it, he was devoted to Boxer; the two of them usually spent their Sundays together in the small paddock beyond the orchard, grazing side by side and never speaking."
Orwell," The shop was a narrow, cold sort of room."
Orwell,"On the outside of the window a few white letters, relics of ancient chocolate advertisements, were scattered like stars."
Orwell,"Inside there was a slab upon which lay the great white folds of tripe, and the grey flocculent stuff known as 'black tripe', and the ghostly translucent feet of pigs, ready boiled."
Orwell,"It was the ordinary 'tripe and pea' shop, and not much else was stocked except bread, cigarettes, and tinned stuff."
Orwell,"'Teas' were advertised in the window, but if a customer demanded a cup of tea he was usually put off with excuses."
Orwell,"Mr Brooker, though out of work for two years, was a miner by trade, but he and his wife had been keeping shops of various kinds as a side-line all their lives."
Orwell,"At one time they had had a pub, but they had lost their licence for allowing gambling on the premises."
Orwell,I doubt whether any of their businesses had ever paid; they were the kind of people who run a business chiefly in order to have something to grumble about.
Orwell,"Mr Brooker was a dark, small-boned, sour, Irish-looking man, and astonishingly dirty."
Orwell,I don't think I ever once saw his hands clean.
Orwell,"As Mrs Brooker was now an invalid he prepared most of the food, and like all people with permanently dirty hands he had a peculiarly intimate, lingering manner of handling things."
Orwell,If he gave you a slice of bread-and-butter there was always a black thumb-print on it.
Orwell,"Even in the early morning when he descended into the mysterious den behind Mrs Brooker's sofa and fished out the tripe, his hands were already black."
Orwell,I heard dreadful stories from the other lodgers about the place where the tripe was kept.
Orwell,Blackbeetles were said to swarm there.
Orwell,"I do not know how often fresh consignments of tripe were ordered, but it was at long intervals, for Mrs Brooker used to date events by it."
Orwell,"'Let me see now, I've had in three lots of froze (frozen tripe) since that happened,' etc."
Orwell,We lodgers were never given tripe to eat.
Orwell,At the time I imagined that this was because tripe was too expensive; I have since thought that it was merely because we knew too much about it.
Orwell,"The Brookers never ate tripe themselves, I noticed."
Orwell, For some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusual position.
Orwell,"Instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall, where it could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite the window."
Orwell,"To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston was now sitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably been intended to hold bookshelves."
Orwell,"By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well back, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so far as sight went."
Orwell,"He could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen."
Orwell,It was partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do.
Orwell, But it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer.
Orwell,It was a peculiarly beautiful book.
Orwell,"Its smooth creamy paper, a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past."
Orwell,"He could guess, however, that the book was much older than that."
Orwell,He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what quarter he did not now remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess it.
Orwell,"Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops ('dealing on the free market', it was called), but the rule was not strictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces and razor blades, which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way."
Orwell,He had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fifty.
Orwell,At the time he was not conscious of wanting it for any particular purpose.
Orwell,He had carried it guiltily home in his briefcase.
Orwell,"Even with nothing written in it, it was a compromising possession."
Kerouac,"Then came spring, the great time of traveling, and everybody in the scattered gang was getting ready to take one trip or another."
Kerouac,"I was busily at work on my novel and when I carne to the halfway mark, after a trip down South with my aunt to visit my brother Rocco, I got ready to travel West for the very first time."
Kerouac,Dean had already left.
Kerouac,Carlo and I saw him off at the 34th Street Greyhound station.
Kerouac,Upstairs they had a place where you could make pictures for a quarter.
Kerouac,Carlo took off his glasses and looked sinister.
Kerouac,Dean made a profile shot and looked coyly around.
Kerouac,I took a straight picture that made me look like a thirty-year-old Italian who’d kill anybody who said anything against his mother.
Kerouac,This picture Carlo and Dean neatly cut down the middle with a razor and saved a half each in their wallets.
Kerouac,Dean was wearing a real Western business suit for his big trip back to Denver; he’d finished his first fling in New York.
Kerouac,"I say fling, but he only worked like a dog in parking lots."
Kerouac,"The most fantastic parking-lot attendant in the world, he can back a car forty miles an hour into a tight squeeze and stop at the wall, jump out, race among fenders, leap into another car, circle it fifty miles an hour in a narrow space, back swiftly into tight spot, hump, snap the car with the emergency so that you see it bounce as he flies out; then clear to the ticket shack, sprinting like a track star, hand a ticket, leap into a newly arrived car before the owner’s half out, leap literally under him as he steps out, start the car with the door flapping, and roar off to the next available spot, arc, pop in, brake, out, run; working like that without pause eight hours a night, evening rush hours and after-theater rush hours, in greasy wino pants with a frayed fur-lined jacket and beat shoes that flap."
Kerouac,"Now he’d bought a new suit to go back in; blue with pencil stripes, vest and all - eleven dollars on Third Avenue, with a watch and watch chain, and a portable typewriter with which he was going to start writing in a Denver rooming house as soon as he got a job there."
Kerouac,"We had a farewell meal of franks and beans in a Seventh Avenue Riker’s, and then Dean got on the bus that said Chicago and roared off into the night."
Kerouac,There went our wrangler.
Kerouac,I promised myself to go the same way when spring really bloomed and opened up the land.
Kerouac,"In the month of July 1947, having saved about fifty dollars from old veteran benefits, I was ready to go to the West Coast."
Kerouac,"My friend Remi Boncœur had written me a letter from San Francisco, saying I should come and ship out with him on an around-the-world liner."
Kerouac,He swore he could get me into the engine room.
Kerouac,I wrote back and said I’d be satisfied with any old freighter so long as I could take a few long Pacific trips and come back with enough money to support myself in my aunt’s house while I finished my book.
Kerouac,He said he had a shack in Mill City and I would have all the time in the world to write there while we went through the rigmarole of getting the ship.
Kerouac,He was living with a girl called Lee Ann; he said she was a marvelous cook and everything would jump.
Kerouac,"Remi was an old prep-school friend, a Frenchman brought up in Paris and a really mad guy - I didn’t know how mad at this time."
Kerouac,So he expected me to arrive in ten days.
Kerouac,"My aunt was all in accord with my trip to the West; she said it would do me good, I’d been working so hard all winter and staying in too much; she even didn’t complain when I told her I’d have to hitchhike some."
Kerouac,All she wanted was for me to come back in one piece.
Kerouac,"So, leaving my big half-manuscript sitting on top of my desk, and folding back my comfortable home sheets for the last time one morning, I left with my canvas bag in which a few fundamental things were packed and took off for the Pacific Ocean with the fifty dollars in my pocket."
Kerouac,"I jumped over the side and ran across Highway 101 to the store, and bought, besides wine, a little bread and candy."
Kerouac,I ran back to my freight train which had another fifteen minutes to wait in the now warm sunny scene.
Kerouac,But it was late afternoon and bound to get cold soon.
Kerouac,The little bum was sitting cross-legged at his end before a pitiful repast of one can of sardines.
Kerouac,"I took pity on him and went over and said, ""How about a little wine to warm you up?"
Kerouac,"Maybe you'd like some bread and cheese with your sardines."" ""Sure thing."" He spoke from far away inside a little meek voice-box afraid or unwilling to assert himself."
Kerouac,I'd bought the cheese three days ago in Mexico City before the long cheap bus trip across Zacatecas and Durango and Chihuahua two thousand long miles to the border at El Paso.
Kerouac,He ate the cheese and bread and drank the wine with gusto and gratitude.
Kerouac,I was pleased.
Kerouac,"I reminded myself of the line in the Diamond Sutra that says, ""Practice charity without holding in mind any conceptions about charity, for charity after all is just a word."" I was very devout in those days and was practicing my religious devotions almost to perfection."
Kerouac,Since then I've become a little hypocritical about my lip-service and a little tired and cynical.
Kerouac,Because now I am grown so old and neutral.
Kerouac,"But then I really believed in the reality of charity and kindness and humility and zeal and neutral tranquillity and wisdom and ecstasy, and I believed that I was an old time bhikku in modern clothes wandering the world (usually the immense triangular arc of New York to Mexico City to San Francisco) in order to turn the wheel of the True Meaning, or Dharma, and gain merit for myself as a future Buddha (Awakener) and as a future Hero in Paradise."
Kerouac,"I had not met Japhy Ryder yet, I was about to the next week, or heard anything about ""Dharma Bums"" although at this time I was a perfect Dharma Bum myself and considered myself a religious wanderer."
Kerouac,"The little bum in the gondola solidified all my beliefs by warming up to the wine and talking and finally whipping out a tiny slip of paper which contained a prayer by Saint Teresa announcing that after her death she will return to the earth by showering it with roses from heaven, forever, for all living creatures."
Kerouac,"And I look around the dismal cell, there’s my hopeful rucksack all neatly packed with everything necessary to live in the woods, even unto the minutest first aid kit and diet details and even a neat little sewing kit cleverly reinforced by my good mother (like extra safety pins, buttons, special sewing needles, little aluminum scissors)… The hopeful medal of St Christopher even which she’d sewn on the flap… The survival kit all in there down to the last little survival sweater and handkerchief and tennis sneakers (for hiking) — But the rucksack sits hopefully in a strewn mess of bottles all empty, empty poor boys of white port, butts, junk, horror… “One fast move or I’m gone, “ I realize, gone the way of the last three years of drunken hopelessness which is a physical and spiritual and metaphysical hopelessness you cant learn in school no matter how many books on existentialism or pessimism you read, or how many jugs of vision producing Ayahuasca you drink, or Mescaline take, or Peyote goop up with — That feeling when you wake up with the delirium tremens with the fear of eerie death dripping from your ears like those special heavy cobwebs spiders weave in the hot countries, the feeling of being a bent back mudman monster groaning underground in hot steaming mud pulling a long hot burden nowhere, the feeling of standing ankledeep in hot boiled pork blood, ugh, of being up to your waist in a giant pan of greasy brown dishwater not a trace of suds left in it… The face of yourself you see in the mirror with its expression of unbearable anguish so haggard and awful with sorrow you cant even cry for a thing so ugly, so lost, no connection whatever with early perfection and therefore nothing to connect with tears or anything: it’s like William Seward Burroughs” “Stranger” suddenly appearing in your place in the mirror — Enough! “One fast move or I’m gone” so I jump up, do my headstand first to pump blood back into the hairy brain, take a shower in the hall, new T-shirt and socks and underwear, pack vigorously, hoist the rucksack and run out throwing the key on the desk and hit the cold street and walk fast to the nearest little grocery store to buy two days of food, stick it in the rucksack, hike thru lost alleys of Russian sorrow where bums sit head on knees in foggy doorways in the goopy eerie city night I’ve got to escape or die, and into the bus station In a half hour into a bus seat, the bus says “Monterey” and off we go down the clean neon hiway and I sleep all the way, waking up amazed and well again smelling sea air the bus driver shaking me “End of the line, Monterey."
Kerouac,"And by God it is Monterey, I stand sleepy in the 2 A.M."
Kerouac,seeing vague little fishing masts across the street from the bus driveway.
Kerouac,Now all I've got to do to complete my escape is get 14 miles down the coast to the Raton Canyon bridge and hike in.
Hemingway,My money was wet but was all right.
Hemingway,I counted it.
Hemingway,There were three thousand and some lire.
Hemingway,My clothes felt wet and clammy and I slapped my arms to keep the circulation going.
Hemingway,I had wovenunderwear and I did not think I would catch cold if I kept moving.
Hemingway,They had taken my pistol at the road and I put the holster under my coat.
Hemingway,I had no cape and it was cold in the rain.
Hemingway,I started up the bank of the canal.
Hemingway,"It was daylight and the country was wet, low and dismal looking."
Hemingway,The fields were bare and wet; a long way away I could see a campanile rising out of the plain.
Hemingway,I came up onto a road.
Hemingway,Ahead I saw some troops coming down the road.
Hemingway,I limped along the side of the road and they passed me and paid no attention to me.
Hemingway,They were a machine-gun detachment going up toward the river.
Hemingway,I went on down the road.
Hemingway,That day I crossed the Venetian plain.
Hemingway,It is a low level country and under the rain it is even flatter.
Hemingway,Toward the sea there are salt marshes and very few roads.
Hemingway,The roads all go along the river mouths to the sea and to cross the country you must go along the paths beside the canals.
Hemingway,I was working across the country from the north to the south and had crossed two railway lines and many roads and finally I came out at the end of a path onto a railway line where it ran beside a marsh.
Hemingway,"It was the main line from Venice to Trieste, with a high solid embankment, a solid roadbed and double track."
Hemingway,Down the tracks a way was a flag- station and I could see soldiers on guard.
Hemingway,Up the line there was a bridge over a stream that flowed into the marsh.
Hemingway,I could see a guard too at the bridge.
Hemingway,"Crossing the fields to the north I had seen a train pass on this railroad, visible a long way across the flat plain, and I thought a train might come from Portogruaro."
Hemingway,I watched the guards and lay down on the embankment so that I could see both ways along the track.
Hemingway,"The guard at the bridgewalked a way up the line toward where flay, then turned and went back toward the bridge."
Hemingway,"I lay, and was hungry, and waited for the train."
Hemingway,The one I had seen was so long that the engine moved it very slowly and I was sure I could get aboard it.
Hemingway,After I had almost given up hoping for one I saw a train coming.
Hemingway,"The engine, coming straight on, grew larger slowly."
Hemingway,I looked at the guard at the bridge.
Hemingway,He was walking on the near side of the bridge but on the other side of the tracks.
Hemingway,That would put him out of sight when the train passed.
Hemingway,I watched the engine come nearer.
Hemingway,It was working hard.
Hemingway,I could see there were many cars.
Hemingway,"I knew there would be guards on the train, and I tried to see where they were, but, keeping out of sight, I could not."
Hemingway,The engine was almost to where I was lying.
Hemingway,"When it came opposite, working and puffing even on the level, and I saw the engineer pass, I stood up and stepped up close to the passing cars."
Hemingway,If the guards were watching I was a less suspicious object standing beside the track.
Hemingway,Several closed freight-cars passed.
Hemingway,"Then I saw a low open car of the sort they call gondolas coming, covered with canvas."
Hemingway,"I stood until it had almost passed, then jumped and caught the rear hand-rods and pulled up."
Hemingway,I crawled down between the gondola and the shelter of the high freight- car behind.
Hemingway,I did not think any one had seen me.
Hemingway,"I was holding to the hand-rods and crouching low, my feet on the coupling."
Hemingway,We were almost opposite the bridge.
Hemingway,I remembered the guard.
Hemingway,As we passed him he looked at me.
Hemingway,He was a boy and his helmet was too big for him.
Hemingway,I stared at him contemptuously and he looked away.
Hemingway,He thought I had something to do with the train.
Hemingway,We were past.
Hemingway,"I saw him still looking uncomfortable, watching the other cars pass and I stooped to see how the canvas was fastened."
Hemingway,It had grummets and was laced down at the edge with cord.
Hemingway,"I took out my knife, cut the cord and put my arm under."
Hemingway,There were hard bulges under the canvas that tightened in the rain.
Hemingway,I looked up and ahead.
Hemingway,There was a guard on the freight-car ahead but he was looking forward.
Hemingway,I let go of the hand-rails and ducked under the canvas.
Hemingway,My forehead hit something that gave me a violent bump and I felt blood on my face but I crawled on in and lay flat.
Hemingway,Then I turned around and fastened down the canvas.
Hemingway,I was in under the canvas with guns.
Hemingway,They smelled cleanly of oil and grease.
Hemingway,I lay and listened to the rain on the canvas and the clicking of the car over the rails.
Hemingway,There was a little light came through and I lay and looked at the guns.
Hemingway,They had their canvas jackets on.
Hemingway,I thought they must have been sent ahead from the third army.
Hemingway,"The bump on my forehead was swollen and I stopped the bleeding by lying still and letting it coagulate, then picked away the dried blood except over the cut."
Hemingway,"I had no handkerchief, but feeling with my fingers I washed away where the dried blood had been, with rainwater that dripped from the canvas, and wiped it clean with the sleeve of my coat."
Hemingway,I did not want to look conspicuous.
Hemingway,I knew I would have to get out before they got to Mestre because they would be taking care of these guns.
Hemingway,They had no guns to lose or forget about.
Hemingway,I was terrifically hungry.
Lawrence,"The man is engine-driver at High Park, tall, with a beard, and very
chapel."
Lawrence,"The woman is a birdy bit of a thing who loves anything
superior."
Lawrence,King's English and allow-me! all the time.
Lawrence,"But they lost
their only son in the war, and it's sort of knocked a hole in them."
Lawrence,"There's a long gawky lass of a daughter training for a school-teacher,
and I help her with her lessons sometimes, so we're quite the family."
Lawrence,"But they're very decent people, and only too kind to me."
Lawrence,"I expect I'm
more coddled than you are."
Lawrence,"It's not inspiring, but then I don't ask to
be inspired."
Lawrence,"I'm used to horses, and cows, though they are very female,
have a soothing effect on me."
Lawrence,"When I sit with my head in her side,
milking, I feel very solaced."
Lawrence,They have six rather fine Herefords.
Lawrence,"Oat-harvest is just over and I enjoyed it, in spite of sore hands and a
lot of rain."
Lawrence,"I don't take much notice of people, but get on with them
all right."
Lawrence,Most things one just ignores.
Lawrence,"I sometimes sit in the Wellington and talk
to the men."
Lawrence,"They grumble a lot, but they're not going to alter
anything."
Lawrence,"As everybody says, the Notts-Derby miners have got their
hearts in the right place."
Lawrence,"But the rest of their anatomy must be in the
wrong place, in a world that has no use for them."
Lawrence,"I like them, but they
don't cheer me much: not enough of the old fighting-cock in them."
Lawrence,"They
talk a lot about nationalization, nationalization of royalties,
nationalization of the whole industry."
Lawrence,"But you can't nationalize coal
and leave all the other industries as they are."
Lawrence,"They talk about putting
coal to new uses, like Sir Clifford is trying to do."
Lawrence,"It may work here
and there, but not as a general thing, I doubt."
Lawrence,"Whatever you make
you've got to sell it."
Lawrence,The men are very apathetic.
Lawrence,"They feel the whole
damned thing is doomed, and I believe it is."
Lawrence,"And they are doomed along
with it."
Lawrence,"Some of the young ones spout about a Soviet, but there's not
much conviction in them."
Lawrence,"There's no sort of conviction about anything,
except that it's all a muddle and a hole."
Lawrence,"Even under a Soviet you've
still got to sell coal: and that's the difficulty."
Lawrence,"The women talk a lot
more than the men, nowadays, and they are a sight more cock-sure."
Lawrence,"The
men are limp, they feel a doom somewhere, and they go about as if there
was nothing to be done."
Lawrence,"Anyhow, nobody knows what should be done in
spite of all the talk, the young ones get mad because they've no money
to spend."
Lawrence,"Their whole life depends on spending money, and now they've
got none to spend."
Lawrence,"That's our civilization and our education: bring up
the masses to depend entirely on spending money, and then the money
gives out."
Lawrence,"The pits are working two days, two and a half days a week,
and there's no sign of betterment even for the winter."
Lawrence,"It means a man
bringing up a family on twenty-five and thirty shillings."
Lawrence,"The women are
the maddest of all."
Lawrence,"But then they're the maddest for spending,
nowadays."
Lawrence,"If only they were educated to LIVE instead of
earn and spend, they could manage very happily on twenty-five
shillings."
Lawrence,"If the men wore scarlet trousers as I said, they wouldn't
think so much of money: if they could dance and hop and skip, and sing
and swagger and be handsome, they could do with very little cash."
Lawrence,"And
amuse the women themselves, and be amused by the women."
Lawrence,"They ought to
learn to be naked and handsome, and to sing in a mass and dance the old
group dances, and carve the stools they sit on, and embroider their own
emblems."
Lawrence,Then they wouldn't need money.
Lawrence,"And that's the only way to
solve the industrial problem: train the people to be able to live and
live in handsomeness, without needing to spend."
Lawrence,But you can't do it.
Lawrence,They're all one-track minds nowadays.
Lawrence,"Whereas the mass of people
oughtn't even to try to think, because they can't."
Lawrence,"They should be alive
and frisky, and acknowledge the great god Pan."
Lawrence,"He's the only god for
the masses, forever."
Lawrence,The few can go in for higher cults if they like.
Lawrence,But let the mass be forever pagan.
Lawrence,"They're a sad lot, a
deadened lot of men: dead to their women, dead to life."
Lawrence,"The young ones
scoot about on motor-bikes with girls, and jazz when they get a chance,
But they're very dead."
Lawrence,And it needs money.
Lawrence,"Money poisons you when
you've got it, and starves you when you haven't."
Wharton, Before my own time there was up I had learned to know what that meant.
Wharton,"Yet I had come in the degenerate day of trolley, bicycle and rural delivery, when communication was easy between the scattered mountain villages, and the bigger towns in the valleys, such as Bettsbridge and Shadd's Falls, had libraries, theatres and Y."
Wharton,halls to which the youth of the hills could descend for recreation.
Wharton,"But when winter shut down on Starkfield and the village lay under a sheet of snow perpetually renewed from the pale skies, I began to see what life there--or rather its negation--must have been in Ethan Frome's young manhood."
Wharton," I had been sent up by my employers on a job connected with the big power-house at Corbury Junction, and a long-drawn carpenters' strike had so delayed the work that I found myself anchored at Starkfield--the nearest habitable spot--for the best part of the winter."
Wharton,"I chafed at first, and then, under the hypnotising effect of routine, gradually began to find a grim satisfaction in the life."
Wharton,During the early part of my stay I had been struck by the contrast between the vitality of the climate and the deadness of the community.
Wharton,"Day by day, after the December snows were over, a blazing blue sky poured down torrents of light and air on the white landscape, which gave them back in an intenser glitter."
Wharton,One would have supposed that such an atmosphere must quicken the emotions as well as the blood; but it seemed to produce no change except that of retarding still more the sluggish pulse of Starkfield.
Wharton,"When I had been there a little longer, and had seen this phase of crystal clearness followed by long stretches of sunless cold; when the storms of February had pitched their white tents about the devoted village and the wild cavalry of March winds had charged down to their support; I began to understand why Starkfield emerged from its six months' siege like a starved garrison capitulating without quarter."
Wharton,"Twenty years earlier the means of resistance must have been far fewer, and the enemy in command of almost all the lines of access between the beleaguered villages; and, considering these things, I felt the sinister force of Harmon's phrase: “Most of the smart ones get away.” But if that were the case, how could any combination of obstacles have hindered the flight of a man like Ethan Frome?"
Wharton, During my stay at Starkfield I lodged with a middle-aged widow colloquially known as Mrs.
Wharton,Ned Hale.
Wharton,Mrs.
Wharton,"Hale's father had been the village lawyer of the previous generation, and “lawyer Varnum's house,”  where my landlady still lived with her mother, was the most considerable mansion in the village."
Wharton,"It stood at one end of the main street, its classic portico and small-paned windows looking down a flagged path between Norway spruces to the slim white steeple of the Congregational church."
Wharton,"It was clear that the Varnum fortunes were at the ebb, but the two women did what they could to preserve a decent dignity; and Mrs."
Wharton,"Hale, in particular, had a certain wan refinement not out of keeping with her pale old-fashioned house."
Wharton," In the “best parlour,” with its black horse-hair and mahogany weakly illuminated by a gurgling Carcel lamp, I listened every evening to another and more delicately shaded version of the Starkfield chronicle."
Wharton,It was not that Mrs.
Wharton,"Ned Hale felt, or affected, any social superiority to the people about her; it was only that the accident of a finer sensibility and a little more education had put just enough distance between herself and her neighbours to enable her to judge them with detachment."
Wharton,"She was not unwilling to exercise this faculty, and I had great hopes of getting from her the missing facts of Ethan Frome's story, or rather such a key to his character as should co-ordinate the facts I knew."
Wharton,Her mind was a store-house of innocuous anecdote and any question about her acquaintances brought forth a volume of detail; but on the subject of Ethan Frome I found her unexpectedly reticent.
Wharton,"There was no hint of disapproval in her reserve; I merely felt in her an insurmountable reluctance to speak of him or his affairs, a low “Yes, I knew them both..."
Wharton,it was awful...” seeming to be the utmost concession that her distress could make to my curiosity.
Wharton," So marked was the change in her manner, such depths of sad initiation did it imply, that, with some doubts as to my delicacy, I put the case anew to my village oracle, Harmon Gow; but got for my pains only an uncomprehending grunt."
Wharton," “Ruth Varnum was always as nervous as a rat; and, come to think of it, she was the first one to see 'em after they was picked up."
Wharton,"It happened right below lawyer Varnum's, down at the bend of the Corbury road, just round about the time that Ruth got engaged to Ned Hale."
Wharton,"The young folks was all friends, and I guess she just can't bear to talk about it."
Wharton,"She's had troubles enough of her own.”  All the dwellers in Starkfield, as in more notable communities, had had troubles enough of their own to make them comparatively indifferent to those of their neighbours; and though all conceded that Ethan Frome's had been beyond the common measure, no one gave me an explanation of the look in his face which, as I persisted in thinking, neither poverty nor physical suffering could have put there."
Wharton,"Nevertheless, I might have contented myself with the story pieced together from these hints had it not been for the provocation of Mrs."
Wharton,"Hale's silence, and--a little later--for the accident of personal contact with the man."
Wharton, He did not in the least wish the future Mrs.
Wharton,Newland Archer to be a simpleton.
Wharton," He meant her (thanks to his enlightening companionship) to develop a social tact and readiness of wit enabling her to hold her own with the most popular married women of the ""younger set,"" in which it was the recognised custom to attract masculine homage while playfully discouraging it."
Wharton," If he had probed to the bottom of his vanity (as he sometimes nearly did) he would have found there the wish that his wife should be as worldly-wise and as eager to please as the married lady whose charms had held his fancy through two mildly agitated years; without, of course, any hint of the frailty which had so nearly marred that unhappy being's life, and had disarranged his own plans for a whole winter."
Wharton," How this miracle of fire and ice was to be created, and to sustain itself in a harsh world, he had never taken the time to think out; but he was content to hold his view without analysing it, since he knew it was that of all the carefully-brushed, white-waistcoated, button-hole-flowered gentlemen who succeeded each other in the club box, exchanged friendly greetings with him, and turned their opera-glasses critically on the circle of ladies who were the product of the system."
Wharton," In matters intellectual and artistic Newland Archer felt himself distinctly the superior of these chosen specimens of old New York gentility; he had probably read more, thought more, and even seen a good deal more of the world, than any other man of the number."
Wharton,"Singly they betrayed their inferiority; but grouped together they represented ""New York,"" and the habit of masculine solidarity made him accept their doctrine on all the issues called moral."
Wharton, He instinctively felt that in this respect it would be troublesome--and also rather bad form--to strike out for himself.
Wharton," But they had; they undoubtedly had; for the low-toned comments behind him left no doubt in Archer's mind that the young woman was May Welland's cousin, the cousin always referred to in the family as ""poor Ellen Olenska.""  Archer knew that she had suddenly arrived from Europe a day or two previously; he had even heard from Miss Welland (not disapprovingly) that she had been to see poor Ellen, who was staying with old Mrs."
Wharton,Mingott.
Wharton," Archer entirely approved of family solidarity, and one of the qualities he most admired in the Mingotts was their resolute championship of the few black sheep that their blameless stock had produced."
Wharton," There was nothing mean or ungenerous in the young man's heart, and he was glad that his future wife should not be restrained by false prudery from being kind (in private) to her unhappy cousin; but to receive Countess Olenska in the family circle was a different thing from producing her in public, at the Opera of all places, and in the very box with the young girl whose engagement to him, Newland Archer, was to be announced within a few weeks."
Wharton," No, he felt as old Sillerton Jackson felt; he did not think the Mingotts would have tried it on! "
Fitzgerald, She was the first “nice” girl he had ever known.
Fitzgerald,"In various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people, but always with indiscernible barbed wire between."
Fitzgerald,He found her excitingly desirable.
Fitzgerald,"He went to her house, at first with other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone."
Fitzgerald,It amazed him—he had never been in such a beautiful house before.
Fitzgerald,But what gave it an air of breathless intensity was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him.
Fitzgerald,"There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms up-stairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender, but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s shining motor-cars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered."
Fitzgerald,"It excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy—it increased her value in his eyes."
Fitzgerald,"He felt their presence all about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions."
Fitzgerald,But he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal accident.
Fitzgerald,"However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders."
Fitzgerald,So he made the most of his time.
Fitzgerald,"He took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously—eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took her because he had no real right to touch her hand."
Fitzgerald,"He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under false pretenses."
Fitzgerald,"I don’t mean that he had traded on his phantom millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he let her believe that he was a person from much the same stratum as herself—that he was fully able to take care of her."
Fitzgerald,"As a matter of fact, he had no such facilities—he had no comfortable family standing behind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world."
Fitzgerald,But he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had imagined.
Fitzgerald,"He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go—but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail."
Fitzgerald,"He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn’t realize just how extraordinary a “nice” girl could be."
Fitzgerald,"She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing."
Fitzgerald,"He felt married to her, that was all."
Fitzgerald,"When they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless, who was, somehow, betrayed."
Fitzgerald,Her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth.
Fitzgerald,"She had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor."
Fitzgerald,"“I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport."
Fitzgerald,"I even hoped for a while that she’d throw me over, but she didn’t, because she was in love with me too."
Fitzgerald,"She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her… Well, there I was, ’way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn’t care."
Fitzgerald,"What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do?” On the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time."
Fitzgerald,"It was a cold fall day, with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed."
Fitzgerald,"Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair."
Fitzgerald,"The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised."
Fitzgerald,"They had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep."
Fitzgerald,He did extraordinarily well in the war.
Fitzgerald,"He was a captain before he went to the front, and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine-guns."
Fitzgerald,"After the Armistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead."
Fitzgerald,He was worried now—there was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy’s letters.
Fitzgerald,She didn’t see why he couldn’t come.
Fitzgerald,"She was feeling the pressure of the world outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all."
Austen," Mr. Collins, said she, speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but, from some particulars that he has related of her Ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."
Austen,"I believe her to be both in a great degree, replied Wickham; I have not seen her for many years; but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent."
Austen,"She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class."
Austen,"Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham’s attentions."
Austen,There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs.
Austen,"Philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody."
Austen,"Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully."
Austen,Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.
Austen,"She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent."
Austen,"Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won; and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs."
Austen,"Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House."
Austen,The situation of the house was good.
Austen,"High hills rose immediately behind, and at no great distance on each side; some of which were open downs, the others cultivated and woody."
Austen,"The village of Barton was chiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows."
Austen,"The prospect in front was more extensive; it commanded the whole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond."
Austen,"The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that direction; under another name, and in another course, it branched out again between two of the steepest of them."
Austen,With the size and furniture of the house Mrs.
Austen,"Dashwood was upon the whole well satisfied; for though her former style of life rendered many additions to the latter indispensable, yet to add and improve was a delight to her; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments."
Austen,"As for the house itself, to be sure, said she, it is too small for our family, but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present, as it is too late in the year for improvements."
Austen,"Perhaps in the spring, if I have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may think about building."
Austen,"These parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here; and I have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other, and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance; this, with a new drawing room which may be easily added, and a bed-chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug little cottage."
Austen,I could wish the stairs were handsome.
Austen,But one must not expect every thing; though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them.
Austen,"I shall see how much I am before-hand with the world in the spring, and we will plan our improvements accordingly."
Austen,"In the mean time, till all these alterations could be made from the savings of an income of five hundred a-year by a woman who never saved in her life, they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it was; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns, and endeavoring, by placing around them books and other possessions, to form themselves a home."
Austen,Marianne’s pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of; and Elinor’s drawings were affixed to the walls of their sitting room.
Austen,"The Crawfords, without wanting to be cured, were very willing to stay."
Austen,"Mary was satisfied with the Parsonage as a present home, and Henry equally ready to lengthen his visit."
Austen,"He had come, intending to spend only a few days with them; but Mansfield promised well, and there was nothing to call him elsewhere."
Austen,It delighted Mrs.
Austen,"Grant to keep them both with her, and Dr. Grant was exceedingly well contented to have it so: a talking pretty young woman like Miss Crawford is always pleasant society to an indolent, stay-at-home man; and Mr. Crawford’s being his guest was an excuse for drinking claret every day."
Austen,The Miss Bertrams’ admiration of Mr. Crawford was more rapturous than anything which Miss Crawford’s habits made her likely to feel.
Austen,"She acknowledged, however, that the Mr. Bertrams were very fine young men, that two such young men were not often seen together even in London, and that their manners, particularly those of the eldest, were very good."
Austen,"He had been much in London, and had more liveliness and gallantry than Edmund, and must, therefore, be preferred; and, indeed, his being the eldest was another strong claim."
Austen,She had felt an early presentiment that she should like the eldest best.
Austen,She knew it was her way.
Austen,"Tom Bertram must have been thought pleasant, indeed, at any rate; he was the sort of young man to be generally liked, his agreeableness was of the kind to be oftener found agreeable than some endowments of a higher stamp, for he had easy manners, excellent spirits, a large acquaintance, and a great deal to say; and the reversion of Mansfield Park, and a baronetcy, did no harm to all this."
Austen,Miss Crawford soon felt that he and his situation might do.
Austen,"She looked about her with due consideration, and found almost everything in his favour: a park, a real park, five miles round, a spacious modern-built house, so well placed and well screened as to deserve to be in any collection of engravings of gentlemen’s seats in the kingdom, and wanting only to be completely new furnished—pleasant sisters, a quiet mother, and an agreeable man himself—with the advantage of being tied up from much gaming at present by a promise to his father, and of being Sir Thomas hereafter."
Austen,It might do very well; she believed she should accept him; and she began accordingly to interest herself a little about the horse which he had to run at the B—— races.
Faulkner," The day dawned bleak and chill, a moving wall of gray light out of the northeast which, instead of dissolving into moisture, seemed to disintegrate into minute and venomous particles, like dust that, when Dilsey opened the door of the cabin and emerged, needled laterally into her flesh, precipitating not so much a moisture as a substance partaking of the quality of thin, not quite congealed oil."
Faulkner,"She wore a stiff black straw hat perched upon her turban, and a maroon velvet cape with a border of mangy and anonymous fur above a dress of purple silk, and she stood in the door for a while with her myriad and sunken face lifted to the weather, and one gaunt hand flac-soled as the belly of a fish, then she moved the cape aside and examined the bosom of her gown."
Faulkner," The gown fell gauntly from her shoulders, across her fallen breasts, then tightened upon her paunch and fell again, ballooning a little above the nether garments which she would remove layer by layer as the spring accomplished and the warm days, in color regal and moribund."
Faulkner,"She had been a big woman once but now her skeleton rose, draped loosely in unpadded skin that tightened again upon a paunch almost dropsical, as though muscle and tissue had been courage or fortitude which the days or the years had consumed until only the indomitable skeleton was left rising like a ruin or a landmark above the somnolent and impervious guts, and above that the collapsed face that gave the impression of the bones themselves being outside the flesh, lifted into the driving day with an expression at once fatalistic and of a child's astonished disappointment, until she turned and entered the house again and closed the door."
Faulkner, The earth immediately about the door was bare.
Faulkner,"It had a patina, as though from the soles of bare feet in generations, like old silver or the walls of Mexican houses which have been plastered by hand."
Faulkner,"Beside the house, shading it in summer, stood three mulberry trees, the fledged leaves that would later be broad and placid as the palms of hands streaming flatly undulant upon the driving air."
Faulkner,"A pair of jaybirds came up from nowhere, whirled up on the blast like gaudy scraps of cloth or paper and lodged in the mulberries, where they swung in raucous tilt and recover, screaming into the wind that ripped their harsh cries onward and away like scraps of paper or of cloth in turn."
Faulkner,"Then three more joined them and they swung and tilted in the wrung branches for a time, screaming."
Faulkner,"The door of the cabin opened and Dilsey emerged once more, this time in a man's felt hat and an army overcoat, beneath the frayed skirts of which her blue gingham dress fell in uneven balloonings, streaming too about her as she crossed the yard and mounted the steps to the kitchen door."
Faulkner," A moment later she emerged, carrying an open umbrella now, which she slanted ahead into the wind, and crossed to the woodpile and laid the umbrella down, still open."
Faulkner,"Immediately she caught at it and arrested it and held to it for a while, looking about her."
Faulkner,"Then she closed it and laid it down and stacked stovewood into her crooked arm, against her breast, and picked up the umbrella and got it open at last and returned to the steps and held the wood precariously balanced while she contrived to close the umbrella, which she propped in the corner just within the door."
Faulkner,She dumped the wood into the box behind the stove.
Faulkner,Then she removed the overcoat and hat and took a soiled apron down from the wall and put it on and built a fire in the stove.
Faulkner,"While she was doing so, rattling the grate bars and clattering the lids, Mrs Compson began to call her from the head of the stairs."
Faulkner," She wore a dressing gown of quilted black satin, holding it close under her chin."
Faulkner,"In the other hand she held a red rubber hot water bottle and she stood at the head of the back stairway, calling ""Dilsey"" at steady and inflectionless intervals into the quiet stairwell that descended into complete darkness, then opened again where a gray window fell across it."
Faulkner,"""Dilsey,"" she called, without inflection or emphasis or haste, as though she were not listening for a reply at all."
Faulkner,"""Dilsey."" "
Orwell, Mr Pitcairn does not tell us how and when it became clear that the P.O.U.M. possessed scores of machine-guns and several thousand rifles.
Orwell,"I have given an estimate of the arms which were at three of the principal P.O.U.M. buildings--about eighty rifles, a few bombs, and no machine-guns; i.e. about sufficient for the armed guards which, at that time, all the political parties placed on their buildings."
Orwell,"It seems strange that afterwards, when the P.O.U.M. was suppressed and all its buildings seized, these thousands of weapons never came to light; especially the tanks and field-guns, which are not the kind of thing that can be hidden up the chimney."
Orwell,But what is revealing in the two statements above is the complete ignorance they display of the local circumstances.
Orwell,According to Mr Pitcairn the P.O.U.M. stole tanks 'from the barracks'.
Orwell,He does not tell us which barracks.
Orwell,"The P.O.U.M. militiamen who were in Barcelona (now comparatively few, as direct recruitment to the party militias had ceased) shared the Lenin Barracks with a considerably larger number of Popular Army troops."
Orwell,"Mr Pitcairn is asking us to believe, therefore, that the P.O.U.M. stole tanks with the connivance of the Popular Army."
Orwell,It is the same with the 'premises' on which the 75-mm.
Orwell,guns were concealed.
Orwell,There is no mention of where these 'premises' were.
Orwell,"Those batteries of guns, firing on the Plaza de Espana appeared in many newspaper reports, but I think we can say with certainty that they never existed."
Orwell,"As I mentioned earlier, I heard no artillery-fire during the fighting, though the Plaza de Espana was only a mile or so away."
Orwell,A few days later I examined the Plaza de Espana and could find no buildings that showed marks of shell-fire.
Orwell,And an eye-witness who was in that neighbourhood throughout the fighting declares that no guns ever appeared there.
Orwell,"(Incidentally, the tale of the stolen guns may have originated with Antonov-Ovseenko, the Russian Consul-General."
Orwell,"He, at any rate, communicated it to a well-known English journalist, who afterwards repeated it in good faith in a weekly paper."
Orwell,Antonov-Ovseenko has since been 'purged'.
Orwell,"How this would affect his credibility I do not know.) The truth is, of course, that these tales about tanks, field-guns, and so forth have only been invented because otherwise it is difficult to reconcile the scale of the Barcelona fighting with the P.O.U.M. 's small numbers."
Orwell,"It was necessary to claim that the P.O.U.M. was wholly responsible for the fighting; it was also necessary to claim that it was an insignificant party with no following and 'numbered only a few thousand members', according to _Inprecor_."
Orwell,The only hope of making both statements credible was to pretend that the P.O.U.M. had all the weapons of a modern mechanized army.
Orwell,"But none of these projects ever comes anywhere near realization, and none of the three super-states ever gains a significant lead on the others."
Orwell,"What is more remarkable is that all three powers already possess, in the atomic bomb, a weapon far more powerful than any that their present researches are likely to discover."
Orwell,"Although the Party, according to its habit, claims the invention for itself, atomic bombs first appeared as early as the nineteen-forties, and were first used on a large scale about ten years later."
Orwell,"At that time some hundreds of bombs were dropped on industrial centres, chiefly in European Russia, Western Europe, and North America."
Orwell,"The effect was to convince the ruling groups of all countries that a few more atomic bombs would mean the end of organized society, and hence of their own power."
Orwell,"Thereafter, although no formal agreement was ever made or hinted at, no more bombs were dropped."
Orwell,All three powers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store them up against the decisive opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or later.
Orwell,And meanwhile the art of war has remained almost stationary for thirty or forty years.
Orwell,"Helicopters are more used than they were formerly, bombing planes have been largely superseded by self-propelled projectiles, and the fragile movable battleship has given way to the almost unsinkable Floating Fortress; but otherwise there has been little development."
Orwell,"The tank, the submarine, the torpedo, the machine gun, even the rifle and the hand grenade are still in use."
Orwell,"And in spite of the endless slaughters reported in the Press and on the telescreens, the desperate battles of earlier wars, in which hundreds of thousands or even millions of men were often killed in a few weeks, have never been repeated."
Orwell,None of the three super-states ever attempts any manoeuvre which involves the risk of serious defeat.
Orwell,"When any large operation is undertaken, it is usually a surprise attack against an ally."
Orwell,"The strategy that all three powers are following, or pretend to themselves that they are following, is the same."
Orwell,"The plan is, by a combination of fighting, bargaining, and well-timed strokes of treachery, to acquire a ring of bases completely encircling one or other of the rival states, and then to sign a pact of friendship with that rival and remain on peaceful terms for so many years as to lull suspicion to sleep."
Orwell,"During this time rockets loaded with atomic bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots; finally they will all be fired simultaneously, with effects so devastating as to make retaliation impossible."
Orwell,"It will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with the remaining world-power, in preparation for another attack."
Orwell,"This scheme, it is hardly necessary to say, is a mere daydream, impossible of realization."
Orwell,"Moreover, no fighting ever occurs except in the disputed areas round the Equator and the Pole: no invasion of enemy territory is ever undertaken."
Orwell,This explains the fact that in some places the frontiers between the super-states are arbitrary.
Orwell,"Eurasia, for example, could easily conquer the British Isles, which are geographically part of Europe, or on the other hand it would be possible for Oceania to push its frontiers to the Rhine or even to the Vistula."
Orwell,"But this would violate the principle, followed on all sides though never formulated, of cultural integrity."
Orwell,"If Oceania were to conquer the areas that used once to be known as France and Germany, it would be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitants, a task of great physical difficulty, or to assimilate a population of about a hundred million people, who, so far as technical development goes, are roughly on the Oceanic level."
Orwell,The problem is the same for all three super-states.
Orwell,"It is absolutely necessary to their structure that there should be no contact with foreigners, except, to a limited extent, with war prisoners and coloured slaves."
Orwell,Even the official ally of the moment is always regarded with the darkest suspicion.
Orwell,"War prisoners apart, the average citizen of Oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either Eurasia or Eastasia, and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages."
Orwell,If he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies.
Orwell,"The sealed world in which he lives would be broken, and the fear, hatred, and self-righteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate."
Orwell,"It is therefore realized on all sides that however often Persia, or Egypt, or Java, or Ceylon may change hands, the main frontiers must never be crossed by anything except bombs."
Kerouac," But in the morning (and I’m no Milarepa who could also sit naked in the snow and was seen flying on one occasion) here comes Ron Blake back with Pat McLear and Pat’s wife the beautiful one, and by God their little sweet five year old girl who is such a pleasant sight to see as she goes jongling and jiggling through the fields to look for flowers, everything to her is perfectly new beautiful primordial Garden of Eden morning here in this tortured human canyon — And a rather beautiful morning develops — There’s fog so we close the blinds and light the fire and the lamp, me and Pat, and sit there drinking from the jug he brought talking about literature and poetry while his wife listens and occasionally gets up to heat more coffee and tea or goes out to play with Ron and the little girl — Pat and I are in a serious talkative mood and I feel that lonely shiver in my chest which always warns me: you actually love people and you’re glad Pat is here."
Kerouac,"Pat is one if not THE most handsome man I’ve ever seen — Strange that he’s announced in a preface to his poems that his heroes, his Triumvirate, are Jean Harlow, Rimbaud and Billy the Kid because he himself is handsome enough to play Billy the Kid in the movies, that same darkhaired handsome slightly sliteyed look you expect from the myth appearance of Billy the Kid (I suppose not the actual real life William Bonnie who’s said to’ve been a pimply cretin monster)."
Kerouac,"So we launch on a big discussion of everything in the comfortable gloom of the cabin by the warm red glow of the girly fire, I’m wearing dark glasses anyway for fun, Pat says “Well Jack I didnt have a chance to talk to you yesterday or even last year or even ten years ago when I first met you, I remember I was terrified of you and Pomeray when you ran up my steps one night with sticks of tea, you looked like a couple of car thieves or bank robbers — And you know a lot of this sneery stuff they’ve written against us, against San Francisco or beat poetry and writers is because a lot of us don’t LOOK like writers or intellectuals or anything, you and Pomeray I must say look awful in a way, I’m sure I dont fill the bill either”— ‘Man you oughta go to Hollywood and play Billy the Kid”— “Man I’d rather go to Hollywood and play Rimbaud”— ‘Well you can’t play Jean Harlow”— “I’d really like to just get my “Dark Brown” published in Paris, do you know that when you think it’s possible a word from you to Gallimard or Girodias would help”— “I dunno”— “Do you know that when I read your poems Mexico City Blues I immediately turned around and started writing a brand new way, you enlightened me with that book”— “But it’s nothing like what you do, in fact it’s miles away, I am a language spinner and you’re idea man” and so on we talk till about noon and Ron’s been in and out, “s’made jaunts to the beach with the little ladies and Pat and I don’t realize the sun has come out but still sit there deep in the cabin by now talking about Villon and Cervantes."
Kerouac,"Suddenly, boom, the door of the cabin is flung open with a loud crash and a burst of sunlight illuminates the room and I see an Angel standing arm outstretched in the door! — It’s Cody! all dressed in his Sunday best in a suit! beside him are ranged several graduating golden angels from Evelyn golden beautiful wife down to the most dazzling angel of them all little Timmy with the sun striking off his hair in beams! - - It’s such an incredible sight and surprise that both Pat and I rise from our chairs involuntarily, like we’ve been lifted up in awe, or scared, tho I dont feel scared so much as ecstatically amazed as tho I’ve seen a vision… And the way Cody stands there not saying a word with his arm outstretched for some reason, struck a pose of some sort to surprise us or warn us, he’s so much like St Michael at the moment it’s unbelievable especially as I also suddenly realize what he’s just actually done, he’s had wife and kiddies sneak up ever so quiet up the porch steps (which are noisy and creaky), across the wood planks, easy and tiptoeing, stood there awhile while he prepared to fling the door open, all lined up and stood straight, then pow, he’s opened the door and thrown the golden universe into the dazzled mystic eyes of big hip Pat McLear and big amazed grateful me."
Kerouac,"It reminds me of the time I once saw a whole tiptoeing gang of couples sneaking into our back kitchen door on West Street in Lowell the leader telling me to shush as I stand there nine years old amazed, then all bursting in on my father innocently listening to the Primo Carnera - Ernie Schaaft fight on the old 1930s radio — For a big roaring toot… But Cody’s oldfashioned family tiptoe sneak carries that strange apocalyptic burst of gold he somehow always manages to produce, like I said elsewhere the time in Mexico he drove an old car over a rutted road very slowly as we were all high on tea and I saw golden Heaven, or the other times he’s always seemed so golden like as I say in a davenport of some sort in Heaven in the golden top of Heaven."
Kerouac,"Not that he means to produce this effect: he’s just standing there with innate dramatic mystery holding forth his arm as if to say Behold, the sun! and Behold, the angels! sorta pointing at all the golden heads of his family and Pat and I stand aghast."
Kerouac,I love Nobody was paying any attention to me up there.
Kerouac,I should have known better.
Kerouac,"It was Terry who brought my soul back; on the tent stove she warmed up the food, and it was one of the greatest meals of my life, I was so hungry and tired."
Kerouac,"Sighing like an old Negro cotton-picker, I reclined on the bed and smoked a cigarette."
Kerouac,Dogs barked in the cool night.
Kerouac,Rickey and Ponzo had given up calling in the evenings.
Kerouac,I was satisfied with that.
Kerouac,"Terry curled up beside me, Johnny sat on my chest, and they drew pictures of animals in my notebook."
Kerouac,The light of our tent burned on the frightful plain.
Kerouac,"The cowboy music twanged in the roadhouse and carried across the fields, all sadness."
Kerouac,It was all right with me.
Kerouac,I kissed my baby and we put out the lights.
Kerouac,"In the morning the dew made the tent sag; I got up with my towel and toothbrush and went to the general motel toilet to wash; then I came back, put on my pants, which were all torn from kneeling in the earth and had been sewed by Terry in the evening, put on my ragged straw hat, which had originally served as Johnny’s toy hat, and went across the highway with my canvas cotton-bag."
Kerouac,Every day I earned approximately a dollar and a half.
Kerouac,It was just enough to buy groceries in the evening on the bicycle.
Kerouac,The days rolled by.
Kerouac,I forgot all about the East and all about Dean and Carlo and the bloody road.
Kerouac,Johnny and I played all the time; he liked me to throw him up in the air and down in the bed.
Kerouac,Terry sat mending clothes.
Kerouac,"I was a man of the earth, precisely as I had dreamed I would be, in Paterson."
Kerouac,There was talk that Terry’s husband was back in Sabinal and out for me; I was ready for him.
Kerouac,One night the Okies went mad in the roadhouse and tied a man to a tree and beat him to a pulp with sticks.
Kerouac,I was asleep at the time and only heard about it.
Kerouac,From then on I carried a big stick with me in the tent in case they got the idea we Mexicans were fouling up their trailer camp.
Kerouac,"They thought I was a Mexican, of course; and in a way I am."
Kerouac,But now it was October and getting much colder in the nights.
Kerouac,The Okie family had a woodstove and planned to stay for the winter.
Kerouac,"We had nothing, and besides the rent for the tent was due."
Kerouac,Terry and I bitterly decided we’d have to leave.
Kerouac,"“Go back to your family,” I said."
Kerouac,"“For God’s sake, you can’t be batting around tents with a baby like Johnny; the poor little tyke is cold.” Terry cried because I was criticizing her motherly instincts; I meant no such thing."
Kerouac,When Ponzo came in the truck one gray afternoon we decided to see her family about the situation.
Kerouac,But I mustn’t be seen and would have to hide in the vineyard.
Kerouac,"We started for Sabinal; the truck broke down, and simultaneously it started to rain wildly."
Kerouac,"“We sat in the old truck, cursing."
Kerouac,Ponzo got out and toiled in the rain.” He was a good old guy after all.
Kerouac,We promised each other one more big bat.
Kerouac,Off we went to a rickety bar in Sabinal Mextown and spent an hour sopping up the brew.
Kerouac,I was through with my chores in the cottonfield.
Kerouac,I could feel the pull of my own life calling me back.
Kerouac,I shot my aunt a penny postcard across the land and asked for another fifty.
Kerouac,We drove to Terry’s family’s shack.
Kerouac,It was situated on the old road that ran between the vineyards.
Kerouac,It was dark when we got there.
Kerouac,They left me off a quarter-mile away and drove to the door.
Kerouac,Light poured out of the door; Terry’s six other brothers were playing their guitars and singing.
Kerouac,The old man was drinking wine.
Kerouac,I heard shouts and arguments above the singing.
Kerouac,They called her a whore because she’d left her no-good husband and gone to LA and left Johnny with them.
Kerouac,The old man was yelling.
Kerouac,"But the sad, fat brown mother prevailed, as she always does among the great fellahin peoples of the world, and Terry was allowed to come back home."
Kerouac,"The brothers began to sing gay songs, fast."
Kerouac,"I huddled in the cold, rainy wind and watched everything across the sad vineyards of October in the valley."
Kerouac," It’s not the words so much as their great harmonic tune and the way Billie sings it, like a woman stroking her man’s hair in soft lamplight."
Kerouac,The winds howled.
Kerouac,"""Okay I will."" Japhy, kneeling there studying his star map, leaning forward slightly to peek up through the overhanging gnarled old rock country trees, with his goatee and all, looked, with thatmighty graw-faced rock behind him, like, exactly like the vision I had of the old Zen Masters of China out in the wilderness."
Kerouac,"He was leaning forward on his knees, upward looking, as if with a holy sutra in his hands."
Kerouac,Pretty soon he went to the snowbank and brought back thechocolate pudding which was now ice cold and absolutely delicious beyond words.
Kerouac,We ate it all up.
Kerouac,"""Maybe we oughta leave some for Morley."" ""Ah it won't keep, it'll melt in the morning sun."" As the fire stopped roaring and just got to be red coals, but big ones six feet long, the night interposed its icy crystal feel 1 more and more but with the smell of smoking logs it was as delicious as chocolate pudding."
Kerouac,"For a while I went on a little walk by myself, out by the shallow iced creek, and sat meditating against a stump of dirt and the huge mountain walls on both sides of our valley were silent masses."
Kerouac,Too cold to do this more than a minute.
Kerouac,"As I came back our orange fire casting its glow on the big rock, and Japhy kneeling and peering up at the sky, and all of it ten thousand feet above the gnashing world, was a picture of peace and good sense."
Kerouac,There was another aspect of Japhy that amazed me: his tremendous and tender sense of charity.
Kerouac,"He was always giving things, always practicing what the Buddhists call the Paramita of Dana, the perfection of charity."
Kerouac,"Now when I came back and sat down by the fire he said ""Well Smith it's about time you owned a set of juju beads you can have these,"" and he handed me the brown wood beads run together over a strong string with the string, black and shiny, coming out at the large bead at the end in a pretty loop."
Kerouac,"""Aw you can't give me something like this, these things come from Japan don't they?"" ""I've got another set of black ones."
Kerouac,"Smith that prayer you gave me tonight is worth that set of juju beads, but you can have it anyway."" A few minutes later he cleaned out the rest of the chocolate pudding but made sure that I got most of it."
Kerouac,Then when he laid boughs over the rock of our clearing and the poncho over that he made sure his sleeping bag was farther away from the fire than mine so I would sure to be warm.
Kerouac,He was always practicing charity.
Kerouac,"In fact he taught me, and a week later I was giving him nice new undershirts I'd discovered in the Goodwill store."
Kerouac,He'd turn right around and make me a gift of a plastic container to keep food in.
Kerouac,For a joke I'd give him a gift of a huge flower from Alvah's yard.
Kerouac,Solemnly a day later he'd bring me a little bouquet of flowers picked in the street plots of Berkeley.
Kerouac,"""And you can keep the sneakers too,"" he said."
Kerouac,"""I've got another pair older than those but just as good."" ""Aw I can't be taking all your things."" ""Smith you don't realize it's a privilege to practice giving presents to others."" The way he did it was charming; there was nothing glittery and Christmasy about it, but almost sad, and sometimes his gifts were old beat-up things but they had the charm of usefulness and sadness of his giving."
Austen,It is a very simple story.
Austen,"He went to town on business three days ago, and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send to John."
Austen,"He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers, and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astleys."
Austen,They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astleys.
Austen,"The party was to be our brother and sister, Henry, Johnand Miss Smith."
Austen,My friend Robert could not resist.
Austen,They called for him in their way; were all extremely amused; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next daywhich he didand in the course of that visit (as I understand) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak in vain.
Austen,"She made him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he is deserving."
Austen,"He came down by yesterdays coach, and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast, to report his proceedings, first on my affairs, and then on his own."
Austen,"This is all that I can relate of the how, where, and when."
Austen,Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her.
Austen,"She will give you all the minute particulars, which only womans language can make interesting."
Austen,In our communications we deal only in the great.
Austen,"However, I must say, that Robert Martins heart seemed for him, and to me, very overflowing; and that he did mention, without its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their"
Austen,"box at Astleys, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry; and that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy."
