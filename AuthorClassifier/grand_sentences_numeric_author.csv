0,1,The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex.
1,1,"Their estatewas large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre oftheir property, where, for many generations, they had lived in sorespectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of theirsurrounding acquaintance."
2,1,"The late owner of this estate was a singleman, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of hislife, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister."
3,1,"But herdeath, which happened ten years before his own, produced a greatalteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and receivedinto his house the family of his nephew Mr."
4,1,"Henry Dashwood, the legalinheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended tobequeath it."
5,1,"In the society of his nephew and niece, and theirchildren, the old Gentleman’s days were comfortably spent."
6,1,Hisattachment to them all increased.
7,1,The constant attention of Mr.
8,1,andMrs.
9,1,"Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely frominterest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solidcomfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of thechildren added a relish to his existence.By a former marriage, Mr."
10,1,"Henry Dashwood had one son: by his presentlady, three daughters."
11,1,"The son, a steady respectable young man, wasamply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age."
12,1,"By his ownmarriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to hiswealth."
13,1,"To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was notso really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independentof what might arise to them from their father’s inheriting thatproperty, could be but small."
14,1,"Their mother had nothing, and theirfather only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for theremaining moiety of his first wife’s fortune was also secured to herchild, and he had only a life-interest in it.The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every otherwill, gave as much disappointment as pleasure."
15,1,"He was neither sounjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew;—buthe left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of thebequest."
16,1,Mr.
17,1,"Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wifeand daughters than for himself or his son;—but to his son, and hisson’s son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, asto leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dearto him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, orby any sale of its valuable woods."
18,1,"The whole was tied up for thebenefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father andmother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his uncle, bysuch attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or threeyears old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having hisown way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweighall the value of all the attention which, for years, he had receivedfrom his niece and her daughters."
19,1,"He meant not to be unkind, however,and, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them athousand pounds a-piece.Mr."
20,1,"Dashwood’s disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper wascheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many years,and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produceof an estate already large, and capable of almost immediateimprovement."
21,1,"But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, washis only one twelvemonth."
22,1,"He survived his uncle no longer; and tenthousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained forhis widow and daughters.His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr.Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illnesscould command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters.Mr."
23,1,"John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of thefamily; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature atsuch a time, and he promised to do every thing in his power to makethem comfortable."
24,1,"His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,and Mr."
25,1,"John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there mightprudently be in his power to do for them.He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold heartedand rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, wellrespected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge ofhis ordinary duties."
26,1,"Had he married a more amiable woman, he might havebeen made still more respectable than he was:—he might even have beenmade amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and veryfond of his wife."
27,1,But Mrs.
28,1,"John Dashwood was a strong caricature ofhimself;—more narrow-minded and selfish.When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself toincrease the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousandpounds a-piece."
29,1,He then really thought himself equal to it.
30,1,"Theprospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,besides the remaining half of his own mother’s fortune, warmed hisheart, and made him feel capable of generosity."
31,1,"“Yes, he would givethem three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It wouldbe enough to make them completely easy."
32,1,"Three thousand pounds! he couldspare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.” He thought ofit all day long, and for many days successively, and he did not repent.No sooner was his father’s funeral over, than Mrs."
33,1,"John Dashwood,without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law,arrived with her child and their attendants."
34,1,"No one could dispute herright to come; the house was her husband’s from the moment of hisfather’s decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much thegreater, and to a woman in Mrs."
35,1,"Dashwood’s situation, with only commonfeelings, must have been highly unpleasing;—but in _her_ mind there wasa sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence ofthe kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source ofimmovable disgust."
36,1,Mrs.
37,1,"John Dashwood had never been a favourite withany of her husband’s family; but she had had no opportunity, till thepresent, of showing them with how little attention to the comfort ofother people she could act when occasion required it.So acutely did Mrs."
38,1,"Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and soearnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it, that, on thearrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, hadnot the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on thepropriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three childrendetermined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid a breachwith their brother.Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possesseda strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualifiedher, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, andenabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all,that eagerness of mind in Mrs."
39,1,Dashwood which must generally have ledto imprudence.
40,1,"She had an excellent heart;—her disposition wasaffectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to governthem: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and whichone of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.Marianne’s abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor’s.She was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her sorrows, herjoys, could have no moderation."
41,1,"She was generous, amiable, interesting:she was everything but prudent."
42,1,"The resemblance between her and hermother was strikingly great.Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister’s sensibility; butby Mrs."
43,1,Dashwood it was valued and cherished.
44,1,They encouraged eachother now in the violence of their affliction.
45,1,"The agony of grief whichoverpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought for, wascreated again and again."
46,1,"They gave themselves up wholly to theirsorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that couldafford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future.Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she could struggle, shecould exert herself."
47,1,"She could consult with her brother, could receiveher sister-in-law on her arrival, and treat her with proper attention;and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion, and encourageher to similar forbearance.Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl; butas she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne’s romance, withouthaving much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair to equalher sisters at a more advanced period of life.CHAPTER II.Mrs."
48,1,"John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland; and hermother and sisters-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors.As such, however, they were treated by her with quiet civility; and byher husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybodybeyond himself, his wife, and their child."
49,1,"He really pressed them, withsome earnestness, to consider Norland as their home; and, as no planappeared so eligible to Mrs."
50,1,"Dashwood as remaining there till she couldaccommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood, his invitationwas accepted.A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of formerdelight, was exactly what suited her mind."
51,1,"In seasons of cheerfulness,no temper could be more cheerful than hers, or possess, in a greaterdegree, that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happinessitself."
52,1,"But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy.Mrs."
53,1,John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intendedto do for his sisters.
54,1,To take three thousand pounds from the fortuneof their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the mostdreadful degree.
55,1,She begged him to think again on the subject.
56,1,"Howcould he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only child too,of so large a sum? And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods,who were related to him only by half blood, which she considered as norelationship at all, have on his generosity to so large an amount."
57,1,"Itwas very well known that no affection was ever supposed to existbetween the children of any man by different marriages; and why was heto ruin himself, and their poor little Harry, by giving away all hismoney to his half sisters?“It was my father’s last request to me,” replied her husband, “that Ishould assist his widow and daughters.”“He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say; ten to one but hewas light-headed at the time."
58,1,"Had he been in his right senses, he couldnot have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half yourfortune from your own child.”“He did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear Fanny; he onlyrequested me, in general terms, to assist them, and make theirsituation more comfortable than it was in his power to do."
59,1,Perhaps itwould have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself.
60,1,He couldhardly suppose I should neglect them.
61,1,"But as he required the promise, Icould not do less than give it; at least I thought so at the time."
62,1,"Thepromise, therefore, was given, and must be performed."
63,1,"Something must bedone for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new home.”“Well, then, _let_ something be done for them; but _that_ somethingneed not be three thousand pounds."
64,1,"Consider,” she added, “that when themoney is once parted with, it never can return."
65,1,"Your sisters willmarry, and it will be gone for ever."
66,1,"If, indeed, it could be restoredto our poor little boy—”“Why, to be sure,” said her husband, very gravely, “that would makegreat difference."
67,1,The time may come when Harry will regret that solarge a sum was parted with.
68,1,"If he should have a numerous family, forinstance, it would be a very convenient addition.”“To be sure it would.”“Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties, if the sum werediminished one half.—Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increaseto their fortunes!”“Oh! beyond anything great! What brother on earth would do half so muchfor his sisters, even if _really_ his sisters! And as it is—only halfblood!—But you have such a generous spirit!”“I would not wish to do any thing mean,” he replied."
69,1,"“One had rather,on such occasions, do too much than too little."
70,1,"No one, at least, canthink I have not done enough for them: even themselves, they can hardlyexpect more.”“There is no knowing what _they_ may expect,” said the lady, “but weare not to think of their expectations: the question is, what you canafford to do.”“Certainly—and I think I may afford to give them five hundred poundsa-piece."
71,1,"As it is, without any addition of mine, they will each haveabout three thousand pounds on their mother’s death—a very comfortablefortune for any young woman.”“To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that they can want noaddition at all."
72,1,They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongstthem.
73,1,"If they marry, they will be sure of doing well, and if they donot, they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of tenthousand pounds.”“That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether, upon thewhole, it would not be more advisable to do something for their motherwhile she lives, rather than for them—something of the annuity kind Imean.—My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself.A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable.”His wife hesitated a little, however, in giving her consent to thisplan.“To be sure,” said she, “it is better than parting with fifteen hundredpounds at once."
74,1,"But, then, if Mrs."
75,1,"Dashwood should live fifteen yearswe shall be completely taken in.”“Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot be worth half thatpurchase.”“Certainly not; but if you observe, people always live for ever whenthere is an annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and healthy,and hardly forty."
76,1,"An annuity is a very serious business; it comes overand over every year, and there is no getting rid of it."
77,1,You are notaware of what you are doing.
78,1,"I have known a great deal of the troubleof annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three toold superannuated servants by my father’s will, and it is amazing howdisagreeable she found it."
79,1,"Twice every year these annuities were to bepaid; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them; and thenone of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned out to beno such thing."
80,1,My mother was quite sick of it.
81,1,"Her income was not herown, she said, with such perpetual claims on it; and it was the moreunkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money would have beenentirely at my mother’s disposal, without any restriction whatever."
82,1,"Ithas given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am sure I wouldnot pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world.”“It is certainly an unpleasant thing,” replied Mr."
83,1,"Dashwood, “to havethose kind of yearly drains on one’s income."
84,1,"One’s fortune, as yourmother justly says, is _not_ one’s own."
85,1,"To be tied down to the regularpayment of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable: ittakes away one’s independence.”“Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it."
86,1,"They thinkthemselves secure, you do no more than what is expected, and it raisesno gratitude at all."
87,1,"If I were you, whatever I did should be done at myown discretion entirely."
88,1,I would not bind myself to allow them anything yearly.
89,1,"It may be very inconvenient some years to spare ahundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses.”“I believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there shouldbe no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally willbe of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because theywould only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a largerincome, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of theyear."
90,1,It will certainly be much the best way.
91,1,"A present of fiftypounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed formoney, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to myfather.”“To be sure it will."
92,1,"Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced withinmyself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money atall."
93,1,"The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as mightbe reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking out for acomfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things,and sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever theyare in season."
94,1,"I’ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed,it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did."
95,1,"Do but consider,my dear Mr."
96,1,"Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your mother-in-lawand her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds,besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, whichbrings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course, they willpay their mother for their board out of it."
97,1,"Altogether, they will havefive hundred a-year amongst them, and what on earth can four women wantfor more than that?—They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will benothing at all."
98,1,"They will have no carriage, no horses, and hardly anyservants; they will keep no company, and can have no expenses of anykind! Only conceive how comfortable they will be! Five hundred a year!I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it; and as toyour giving them more, it is quite absurd to think of it."
99,1,"They will bemuch more able to give _you_ something.”“Upon my word,” said Mr."
100,1,"Dashwood, “I believe you are perfectly right.My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me thanwhat you say."
101,1,"I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfilmy engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as youhave described."
102,1,When my mother removes into another house my servicesshall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can.
103,1,"Some littlepresent of furniture too may be acceptable then.”“Certainly,” returned Mrs."
104,1,John Dashwood.
105,1,"“But, however, _one_ thingmust be considered."
106,1,"When your father and mother moved to Norland,though the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the china, plate, andlinen was saved, and is now left to your mother."
107,1,Her house willtherefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it.”“That is a material consideration undoubtedly.
108,1,A valuable legacyindeed! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasantaddition to our own stock here.”“Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as whatbelongs to this house.
109,1,"A great deal too handsome, in my opinion, forany place _they_ can ever afford to live in."
110,1,"But, however, so it is.Your father thought only of _them_."
111,1,"And I must say this: that you oweno particular gratitude to him, nor attention to his wishes; for wevery well know that if he could, he would have left almost everythingin the world to _them_.”This argument was irresistible."
112,1,"It gave to his intentions whatever ofdecision was wanting before; and he finally resolved, that it would beabsolutely unnecessary, if not highly indecorous, to do more for thewidow and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly acts ashis own wife pointed out.CHAPTER III.Mrs."
113,1,"Dashwood remained at Norland several months; not from anydisinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceasedto raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while; for whenher spirits began to revive, and her mind became capable of some otherexertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholyremembrances, she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in herinquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland; forto remove far from that beloved spot was impossible."
114,1,"But she could hearof no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease,and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter, whose steadier judgmentrejected several houses as too large for their income, which her motherwould have approved.Mrs."
115,1,"Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise onthe part of his son in their favour, which gave comfort to his lastearthly reflections."
116,1,"She doubted the sincerity of this assurance nomore than he had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for herdaughters’ sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she waspersuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000£ would support her inaffluence."
117,1,"For their brother’s sake, too, for the sake of his ownheart, she rejoiced; and she reproached herself for being unjust to hismerit before, in believing him incapable of generosity."
118,1,"His attentivebehaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfarewas dear to him, and, for a long time, she firmly relied on theliberality of his intentions.The contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance, felt forher daughter-in-law, was very much increased by the farther knowledgeof her character, which half a year’s residence in her family afforded;and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternalaffection on the side of the former, the two ladies might have found itimpossible to have lived together so long, had not a particularcircumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility, according tothe opinions of Mrs."
119,1,"Dashwood, to her daughters’ continuance atNorland.This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl andthe brother of Mrs."
120,1,"John Dashwood, a gentleman-like and pleasing youngman, who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister’sestablishment at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part ofhis time there.Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives ofinterest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had diedvery rich; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence,for, except a trifling sum, the whole of his fortune depended on thewill of his mother."
121,1,But Mrs.
122,1,Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by eitherconsideration.
123,1,"It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality."
124,1,"Itwas contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of fortuneshould keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance ofdisposition; and that Elinor’s merit should not be acknowledged byevery one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by anypeculiar graces of person or address."
125,1,"He was not handsome, and hismanners required intimacy to make them pleasing."
126,1,"He was too diffidentto do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,his behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart."
127,1,"Hisunderstanding was good, and his education had given it solidimprovement."
128,1,"But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition toanswer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see himdistinguished—as—they hardly knew what."
129,1,They wanted him to make a finefigure in the world in some manner or other.
130,1,"His mother wished tointerest him in political concerns, to get him into parliament, or tosee him connected with some of the great men of the day."
131,1,Mrs.
132,1,"JohnDashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while, till one of thesesuperior blessings could be attained, it would have quieted herambition to see him driving a barouche."
133,1,But Edward had no turn forgreat men or barouches.
134,1,All his wishes centered in domestic comfort andthe quiet of private life.
135,1,Fortunately he had a younger brother who wasmore promising.Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engagedmuch of Mrs.
136,1,"Dashwood’s attention; for she was, at that time, in suchaffliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects."
137,1,"She sawonly that he was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it."
138,1,"Hedid not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed conversation.She was first called to observe and approve him farther, by areflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the differencebetween him and his sister."
139,1,"It was a contrast which recommended himmost forcibly to her mother.“It is enough,” said she; “to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough."
140,1,Itimplies everything amiable.
141,1,"I love him already.”“I think you will like him,” said Elinor, “when you know more of him.”“Like him!” replied her mother with a smile."
142,1,“I feel no sentiment ofapprobation inferior to love.”“You may esteem him.”“I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love.”Mrs.
143,1,Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him.
144,1,"Her mannerswere attaching, and soon banished his reserve."
145,1,"She speedilycomprehended all his merits; the persuasion of his regard for Elinorperhaps assisted her penetration; but she really felt assured of hisworth: and even that quietness of manner, which militated against allher established ideas of what a young man’s address ought to be, was nolonger uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temperaffectionate.No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour toElinor, than she considered their serious attachment as certain, andlooked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching.“In a few months, my dear Marianne,” said she, “Elinor will, in allprobability be settled for life."
146,1,"We shall miss her; but _she_ will behappy.”“Oh! Mama, how shall we do without her?”“My love, it will be scarcely a separation."
147,1,"We shall live within a fewmiles of each other, and shall meet every day of our lives."
148,1,"You willgain a brother, a real, affectionate brother."
149,1,I have the highestopinion in the world of Edward’s heart.
150,1,"But you look grave, Marianne;do you disapprove your sister’s choice?”“Perhaps,” said Marianne, “I may consider it with some surprise."
151,1,"Edwardis very amiable, and I love him tenderly."
152,1,But yet—he is not the kind ofyoung man—there is something wanting—his figure is not striking; it hasnone of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriouslyattach my sister.
153,1,"His eyes want all that spirit, that fire, which atonce announce virtue and intelligence."
154,1,"And besides all this, I amafraid, Mama, he has no real taste."
155,1,"Music seems scarcely to attracthim, and though he admires Elinor’s drawings very much, it is not theadmiration of a person who can understand their worth."
156,1,"It is evident,in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws, that in facthe knows nothing of the matter."
157,1,"He admires as a lover, not as aconnoisseur."
158,1,"To satisfy me, those characters must be united."
159,1,I couldnot be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincidewith my own.
160,1,"He must enter into all my feelings; the same books, thesame music must charm us both."
161,1,"Oh! mama, how spiritless, how tame wasEdward’s manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister mostseverely."
162,1,"Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcelyto notice it."
163,1,I could hardly keep my seat.
164,1,"To hear those beautifullines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with suchimpenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference!”“He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose.I thought so at the time; but you _would_ give him Cowper.”“Nay, Mama, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!—but we must allowfor difference of taste."
165,1,"Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore shemay overlook it, and be happy with him."
166,1,"But it would have broke _my_heart, had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that Ishall never see a man whom I can really love."
167,1,"I require so much! Hemust have all Edward’s virtues, and his person and manners mustornament his goodness with every possible charm.”“Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen."
168,1,It is yet too early inlife to despair of such a happiness.
169,1,"Why should you be less fortunatethan your mother? In one circumstance only, my Marianne, may yourdestiny be different from hers!”CHAPTER IV.“What a pity it is, Elinor,” said Marianne, “that Edward should have notaste for drawing.”“No taste for drawing!” replied Elinor, “why should you think so? Hedoes not draw himself, indeed, but he has great pleasure in seeing theperformances of other people, and I assure you he is by no meansdeficient in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities ofimproving it."
170,1,"Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he wouldhave drawn very well."
171,1,"He distrusts his own judgment in such matters somuch, that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture;but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste, which ingeneral direct him perfectly right.”Marianne was afraid of offending, and said no more on the subject; butthe kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him by thedrawings of other people, was very far from that rapturous delight,which, in her opinion, could alone be called taste."
172,1,"Yet, though smilingwithin herself at the mistake, she honoured her sister for that blindpartiality to Edward which produced it.“I hope, Marianne,” continued Elinor, “you do not consider him asdeficient in general taste."
173,1,"Indeed, I think I may say that you cannot,for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial, and if _that_ were youropinion, I am sure you could never be civil to him.”Marianne hardly knew what to say."
174,1,"She would not wound the feelings ofher sister on any account, and yet to say what she did not believe wasimpossible."
175,1,"At length she replied:“Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him is not in every thingequal to your sense of his merits."
176,1,"I have not had so many opportunitiesof estimating the minuter propensities of his mind, his inclinationsand tastes, as you have; but I have the highest opinion in the world ofhis goodness and sense."
177,1,"I think him every thing that is worthy andamiable.”“I am sure,” replied Elinor, with a smile, “that his dearest friendscould not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that."
178,1,"I do notperceive how you could express yourself more warmly.”Marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased.“Of his sense and his goodness,” continued Elinor, “no one can, Ithink, be in doubt, who has seen him often enough to engage him inunreserved conversation."
179,1,The excellence of his understanding and hisprinciples can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keepshim silent.
180,1,"You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth.But of his minuter propensities, as you call them you have frompeculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself."
181,1,"He and Ihave been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have beenwholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother."
182,1,"Ihave seen a great deal of him, have studied his sentiments and heardhis opinion on subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole, Iventure to pronounce that his mind is well-informed, enjoyment of booksexceedingly great, his imagination lively, his observation just andcorrect, and his taste delicate and pure."
183,1,His abilities in everyrespect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person.
184,1,"Atfirst sight, his address is certainly not striking; and his person canhardly be called handsome, till the expression of his eyes, which areuncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his countenance, isperceived."
185,1,"At present, I know him so well, that I think him reallyhandsome; or at least, almost so."
186,1,"What say you, Marianne?”“I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I do not now."
187,1,"Whenyou tell me to love him as a brother, I shall no more see imperfectionin his face, than I now do in his heart.”Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth shehad been betrayed into, in speaking of him."
188,1,She felt that Edward stoodvery high in her opinion.
189,1,She believed the regard to be mutual; but sherequired greater certainty of it to make Marianne’s conviction of theirattachment agreeable to her.
190,1,"She knew that what Marianne and her motherconjectured one moment, they believed the next—that with them, to wishwas to hope, and to hope was to expect."
191,1,"She tried to explain the realstate of the case to her sister.“I do not attempt to deny,” said she, “that I think very highly ofhim—that I greatly esteem, that I like him.”Marianne here burst forth with indignation—“Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh! worse thancold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise."
192,1,"Use those words again, and Iwill leave the room this moment.”Elinor could not help laughing."
193,1,"“Excuse me,” said she; “and be assuredthat I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of myown feelings."
194,1,"Believe them to be stronger than I have declared; believethem, in short, to be such as his merit, and the suspicion—the hope ofhis affection for me may warrant, without imprudence or folly."
195,1,Butfarther than this you must _not_ believe.
196,1,I am by no means assured ofhis regard for me.
197,1,"There are moments when the extent of it seemsdoubtful; and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder atmy wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality, bybelieving or calling it more than it is."
198,1,In my heart I feellittle—scarcely any doubt of his preference.
199,1,But there are other pointsto be considered besides his inclination.
200,1,He is very far from beingindependent.
201,1,"What his mother really is we cannot know; but, fromFanny’s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have neverbeen disposed to think her amiable; and I am very much mistaken ifEdward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties inhis way, if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a greatfortune or high rank.”Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her motherand herself had outstripped the truth.“And you really are not engaged to him!” said she."
202,1,“Yet it certainlysoon will happen.
203,1,But two advantages will proceed from this delay.
204,1,"_I_shall not lose you so soon, and Edward will have greater opportunity ofimproving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must beso indispensably necessary to your future felicity."
205,1,"Oh! if he should beso far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself, howdelightful it would be!”Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister."
206,1,She could not considerher partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne hadbelieved it.
207,1,"There was, at times, a want of spirits about him which, ifit did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost asunpromising."
208,1,"A doubt of her regard, supposing him to feel it, need notgive him more than inquietude."
209,1,It would not be likely to produce thatdejection of mind which frequently attended him.
210,1,A more reasonablecause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade theindulgence of his affection.
211,1,"She knew that his mother neither behavedto him so as to make his home comfortable at present, nor to give himany assurance that he might form a home for himself, without strictlyattending to her views for his aggrandizement."
212,1,"With such a knowledge asthis, it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject."
213,1,"She wasfar from depending on that result of his preference of her, which hermother and sister still considered as certain."
214,1,"Nay, the longer theywere together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard; andsometimes, for a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no morethan friendship.But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough, when perceivedby his sister, to make her uneasy, and at the same time, (which wasstill more common,) to make her uncivil."
215,1,"She took the first opportunityof affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to her soexpressively of her brother’s great expectations, of Mrs."
216,1,"Ferrars’sresolution that both her sons should marry well, and of the dangerattending any young woman who attempted to _draw him in;_ that Mrs.Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to becalm."
217,1,"She gave her an answer which marked her contempt, and instantlyleft the room, resolving that, whatever might be the inconvenience orexpense of so sudden a removal, her beloved Elinor should not beexposed another week to such insinuations.In this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered to her from thepost, which contained a proposal particularly well timed."
218,1,"It was theoffer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation ofher own, a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire."
219,1,"Theletter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spiritof friendly accommodation."
220,1,"He understood that she was in need of adwelling; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage,he assured her that everything should be done to it which she mightthink necessary, if the situation pleased her."
221,1,"He earnestly pressedher, after giving the particulars of the house and garden, to come withher daughters to Barton Park, the place of his own residence, fromwhence she might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the houseswere in the same parish, could, by any alteration, be made comfortableto her."
222,1,He seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole ofhis letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail ofgiving pleasure to his cousin; more especially at a moment when she wassuffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearerconnections.
223,1,She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry.
224,1,Herresolution was formed as she read.
225,1,"The situation of Barton, in a countyso far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hoursbefore, would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh everypossible advantage belonging to the place, was now its firstrecommendation."
226,1,"To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer anevil; it was an object of desire; it was a blessing, in comparison ofthe misery of continuing her daughter-in-law’s guest; and to remove forever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit orvisit it while such a woman was its mistress."
227,1,"She instantly wrote SirJohn Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness, and her acceptanceof his proposal; and then hastened to show both letters to herdaughters, that she might be secure of their approbation before heranswer were sent.Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settleat some distance from Norland, than immediately amongst their presentacquaintance."
228,1,"On _that_ head, therefore, it was not for her to opposeher mother’s intention of removing into Devonshire."
229,1,"The house, too, asdescribed by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent souncommonly moderate, as to leave her no right of objection on eitherpoint; and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought any charmto her fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norlandbeyond her wishes, she made no attempt to dissuade her mother fromsending a letter of acquiescence.CHAPTER V.No sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs."
230,1,"Dashwood indulgedherself in the pleasure of announcing to her son-in-law and his wifethat she was provided with a house, and should incommode them no longerthan till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it."
231,1,They heard herwith surprise.
232,1,Mrs.
233,1,John Dashwood said nothing; but her husband civillyhoped that she would not be settled far from Norland.
234,1,"She had greatsatisfaction in replying that she was going into Devonshire.—Edwardturned hastily towards her, on hearing this, and, in a voice ofsurprise and concern, which required no explanation to her, repeated,“Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there? So far from hence! And towhat part of it?” She explained the situation."
235,1,"It was within four milesnorthward of Exeter.“It is but a cottage,” she continued, “but I hope to see many of myfriends in it."
236,1,"A room or two can easily be added; and if my friendsfind no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I willfind none in accommodating them.”She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr."
237,1,and Mrs.
238,1,John Dashwoodto visit her at Barton; and to Edward she gave one with still greateraffection.
239,1,"Though her late conversation with her daughter-in-law hadmade her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than wasunavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect on her in thatpoint to which it principally tended."
240,1,To separate Edward and Elinor wasas far from being her object as ever; and she wished to show Mrs.
241,1,"JohnDashwood, by this pointed invitation to her brother, how totally shedisregarded her disapprobation of the match.Mr."
242,1,John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorryhe was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as toprevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture.
243,1,Hereally felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the veryexertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to hisfather was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.—The furniturewas all sent around by water.
244,1,"It chiefly consisted of household linen,plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne’s."
245,1,Mrs.John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could not helpfeeling it hard that as Mrs.
246,1,"Dashwood’s income would be so trifling incomparison with their own, she should have any handsome article offurniture.Mrs."
247,1,"Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was ready furnished,and she might have immediate possession."
248,1,"No difficulty arose on eitherside in the agreement; and she waited only for the disposal of hereffects at Norland, and to determine her future household, before sheset off for the west; and this, as she was exceedingly rapid in theperformance of everything that interested her, was soon done.—Thehorses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after hisdeath, and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage,she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldestdaughter."
249,1,"For the comfort of her children, had she consulted only herown wishes, she would have kept it; but the discretion of Elinorprevailed."
250,1,"_Her_ wisdom too limited the number of their servants tothree; two maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided fromamongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland.The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire,to prepare the house for their mistress’s arrival; for as LadyMiddleton was entirely unknown to Mrs."
251,1,"Dashwood, she preferred goingdirectly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and sherelied so undoubtingly on Sir John’s description of the house, as tofeel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own.Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution bythe evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of herremoval; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealedunder a cold invitation to her to defer her departure."
252,1,Now was the timewhen her son-in-law’s promise to his father might with particularpropriety be fulfilled.
253,1,"Since he had neglected to do it on first comingto the estate, their quitting his house might be looked on as the mostsuitable period for its accomplishment."
254,1,But Mrs.
255,1,"Dashwood began shortlyto give over every hope of the kind, and to be convinced, from thegeneral drift of his discourse, that his assistance extended no fartherthan their maintenance for six months at Norland."
256,1,"He so frequentlytalked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping, and of the perpetualdemands upon his purse, which a man of any consequence in the world wasbeyond calculation exposed to, that he seemed rather to stand in needof more money himself than to have any design of giving money away.In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton’sfirst letter to Norland, every thing was so far settled in their futureabode as to enable Mrs."
257,1,Dashwood and her daughters to begin theirjourney.Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place somuch beloved.
258,1,"“Dear, dear Norland!” said Marianne, as she wanderedalone before the house, on the last evening of their being there; “whenshall I cease to regret you!—when learn to feel a home elsewhere!—Oh!happy house, could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from thisspot, from whence perhaps I may view you no more!—And you, yewell-known trees!—but you will continue the same.—No leaf will decaybecause we are removed, nor any branch become motionless although wecan observe you no longer!—No; you will continue the same; unconsciousof the pleasure or the regret you occasion, and insensible of anychange in those who walk under your shade!—But who will remain to enjoyyou?”CHAPTER VI.The first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy adisposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant."
259,1,"But as theydrew towards the end of it, their interest in the appearance of acountry which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a viewof Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness."
260,1,"It was apleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich in pasture."
261,1,"After windingalong it for more than a mile, they reached their own house."
262,1,"A smallgreen court was the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat wicketgate admitted them into it.As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable and compact;but as a cottage it was defective, for the building was regular, theroof was tiled, the window shutters were not painted green, nor werethe walls covered with honeysuckles."
263,1,A narrow passage led directlythrough the house into the garden behind.
264,1,"On each side of the entrancewas a sitting room, about sixteen feet square; and beyond them were theoffices and the stairs."
265,1,Four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the restof the house.
266,1,"It had not been built many years and was in good repair.In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!—but the tearswhich recollection called forth as they entered the house were soondried away."
267,1,"They were cheered by the joy of the servants on theirarrival, and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy.It was very early in September; the season was fine, and from firstseeing the place under the advantage of good weather, they received animpression in its favour which was of material service in recommendingit to their lasting approbation.The situation of the house was good."
268,1,"High hills rose immediatelybehind, and at no great distance on each side; some of which were opendowns, the others cultivated and woody."
269,1,"The village of Barton waschiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from thecottage windows."
270,1,"The prospect in front was more extensive; it commandedthe whole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond."
271,1,"The hillswhich surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that direction;under another name, and in another course, it branched out againbetween two of the steepest of them.With the size and furniture of the house Mrs."
272,1,"Dashwood was upon thewhole well satisfied; for though her former style of life rendered manyadditions to the latter indispensable, yet to add and improve was adelight to her; and she had at this time ready money enough to supplyall that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments."
273,1,"“As for thehouse itself, to be sure,” said she, “it is too small for our family,but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present, as itis too late in the year for improvements."
274,1,"Perhaps in the spring, if Ihave plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may think aboutbuilding."
275,1,"These parlors are both too small for such parties of ourfriends as I hope to see often collected here; and I have some thoughtsof throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of theother, and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance; this,with a new drawing room which may be easily added, and a bed-chamberand garret above, will make it a very snug little cottage."
276,1,I could wishthe stairs were handsome.
277,1,But one must not expect every thing; though Isuppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them.
278,1,"I shall see howmuch I am before-hand with the world in the spring, and we will planour improvements accordingly.”In the mean time, till all these alterations could be made from thesavings of an income of five hundred a-year by a woman who never savedin her life, they were wise enough to be contented with the house as itwas; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns,and endeavoring, by placing around them books and other possessions, toform themselves a home."
279,1,"Marianne’s pianoforte was unpacked and properlydisposed of; and Elinor’s drawings were affixed to the walls of theirsitting room.In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfastthe next day by the entrance of their landlord, who called to welcomethem to Barton, and to offer them every accommodation from his ownhouse and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient."
280,1,SirJohn Middleton was a good looking man about forty.
281,1,"He had formerlyvisited at Stanhill, but it was too long for his young cousins toremember him."
282,1,His countenance was thoroughly good-humoured; and hismanners were as friendly as the style of his letter.
283,1,"Their arrivalseemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort to be anobject of real solicitude to him."
284,1,"He said much of his earnest desire oftheir living in the most sociable terms with his family, and pressedthem so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they werebetter settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried to apoint of perseverance beyond civility, they could not give offence."
285,1,"Hiskindness was not confined to words; for within an hour after he leftthem, a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from thepark, which was followed before the end of the day by a present ofgame."
286,1,"He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their letters to and fromthe post for them, and would not be denied the satisfaction of sendingthem his newspaper every day.Lady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him, denoting herintention of waiting on Mrs."
287,1,"Dashwood as soon as she could be assuredthat her visit would be no inconvenience; and as this message wasanswered by an invitation equally polite, her ladyship was introducedto them the next day.They were, of course, very anxious to see a person on whom so much oftheir comfort at Barton must depend; and the elegance of her appearancewas favourable to their wishes."
288,1,"Lady Middleton was not more than six orseven and twenty; her face was handsome, her figure tall and striking,and her address graceful."
289,1,Her manners had all the elegance which herhusband’s wanted.
290,1,"But they would have been improved by some share ofhis frankness and warmth; and her visit was long enough to detractsomething from their first admiration, by showing that, thoughperfectly well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say forherself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark.Conversation however was not wanted, for Sir John was very chatty, andLady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her theireldest child, a fine little boy about six years old, by which meansthere was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case ofextremity, for they had to enquire his name and age, admire his beauty,and ask him questions which his mother answered for him, while he hungabout her and held down his head, to the great surprise of herladyship, who wondered at his being so shy before company, as he couldmake noise enough at home."
291,1,"On every formal visit a child ought to be ofthe party, by way of provision for discourse."
292,1,"In the present case ittook up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like hisfather or mother, and in what particular he resembled either, for ofcourse every body differed, and every body was astonished at theopinion of the others.An opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on therest of the children, as Sir John would not leave the house withoutsecuring their promise of dining at the park the next day.CHAPTER VII.Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage."
293,1,"The ladies hadpassed near it in their way along the valley, but it was screened fromtheir view at home by the projection of a hill."
294,1,The house was large andhandsome; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality andelegance.
295,1,"The former was for Sir John’s gratification, the latter forthat of his lady."
296,1,"They were scarcely ever without some friends stayingwith them in the house, and they kept more company of every kind thanany other family in the neighbourhood."
297,1,"It was necessary to thehappiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper and outwardbehaviour, they strongly resembled each other in that total want oftalent and taste which confined their employments, unconnected withsuch as society produced, within a very narrow compass."
298,1,"Sir John was asportsman, Lady Middleton a mother."
299,1,"He hunted and shot, and shehumoured her children; and these were their only resources."
300,1,"LadyMiddleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all theyear round, while Sir John’s independent employments were in existenceonly half the time."
301,1,"Continual engagements at home and abroad, however,supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education; supported thegood spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise to the good breeding of hiswife.Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table, and ofall her domestic arrangements; and from this kind of vanity was hergreatest enjoyment in any of their parties."
302,1,"But Sir John’s satisfactionin society was much more real; he delighted in collecting about himmore young people than his house would hold, and the noisier they werethe better was he pleased."
303,1,"He was a blessing to all the juvenile partof the neighbourhood, for in summer he was for ever forming parties toeat cold ham and chicken out of doors, and in winter his private ballswere numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under theunsatiable appetite of fifteen.The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joyto him, and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitantshe had now procured for his cottage at Barton."
304,1,"The Miss Dashwoods wereyoung, pretty, and unaffected."
305,1,It was enough to secure his goodopinion; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want tomake her mind as captivating as her person.
306,1,"The friendliness of hisdisposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situationmight be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate."
307,1,"Inshowing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfactionof a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in hiscottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman,though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, isnot often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to aresidence within his own manor.Mrs."
308,1,"Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house bySir John, who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity;and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the youngladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the daybefore, at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them."
309,1,"Theywould see, he said, only one gentleman there besides himself; aparticular friend who was staying at the park, but who was neither veryyoung nor very gay."
310,1,"He hoped they would all excuse the smallness of theparty, and could assure them it should never happen so again."
311,1,"He hadbeen to several families that morning in hopes of procuring someaddition to their number, but it was moonlight and every body was fullof engagements."
312,1,"Luckily Lady Middleton’s mother had arrived at Bartonwithin the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman,he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they mightimagine."
313,1,"The young ladies, as well as their mother, were perfectlysatisfied with having two entire strangers of the party, and wished forno more.Mrs."
314,1,"Jennings, Lady Middleton’s mother, was a good-humoured, merry,fat, elderly woman, who talked a great deal, seemed very happy, andrather vulgar."
315,1,"She was full of jokes and laughter, and before dinnerwas over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers andhusbands; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex,and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not."
316,1,"Marianne wasvexed at it for her sister’s sake, and turned her eyes towards Elinorto see how she bore these attacks, with an earnestness which gaveElinor far more pain than could arise from such common-place railleryas Mrs."
317,1,"Jennings’s.Colonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no more adapted byresemblance of manner to be his friend, than Lady Middleton was to behis wife, or Mrs."
318,1,Jennings to be Lady Middleton’s mother.
319,1,He was silentand grave.
320,1,"His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite of hisbeing in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old bachelor,for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty; but though his facewas not handsome, his countenance was sensible, and his address wasparticularly gentlemanlike.There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them ascompanions to the Dashwoods; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middletonwas so particularly repulsive, that in comparison of it the gravity ofColonel Brandon, and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and hismother-in-law was interesting."
321,1,"Lady Middleton seemed to be roused toenjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner,who pulled her about, tore her clothes, and put an end to every kind ofdiscourse except what related to themselves.In the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical, she wasinvited to play."
322,1,"The instrument was unlocked, every body prepared to becharmed, and Marianne, who sang very well, at their request wentthrough the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought intothe family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain ever since inthe same position on the pianoforte, for her ladyship had celebratedthat event by giving up music, although by her mother’s account, shehad played extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.Marianne’s performance was highly applauded."
323,1,"Sir John was loud in hisadmiration at the end of every song, and as loud in his conversationwith the others while every song lasted."
324,1,"Lady Middleton frequentlycalled him to order, wondered how any one’s attention could be divertedfrom music for a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a particular songwhich Marianne had just finished."
325,1,"Colonel Brandon alone, of all theparty, heard her without being in raptures."
326,1,"He paid her only thecompliment of attention; and she felt a respect for him on theoccasion, which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shamelesswant of taste."
327,1,"His pleasure in music, though it amounted not to thatecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own, wasestimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of theothers; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five andthirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and everyexquisite power of enjoyment."
328,1,She was perfectly disposed to make everyallowance for the colonel’s advanced state of life which humanityrequired.CHAPTER VIII.Mrs.
329,1,Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure.
330,1,"She had only twodaughters, both of whom she had lived to see respectably married, andshe had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of theworld."
331,1,"In the promotion of this object she was zealously active, as faras her ability reached; and missed no opportunity of projectingweddings among all the young people of her acquaintance."
332,1,"She wasremarkably quick in the discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed theadvantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady byinsinuations of her power over such a young man; and this kind ofdiscernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively topronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with MarianneDashwood."
333,1,"She rather suspected it to be so, on the very first eveningof their being together, from his listening so attentively while shesang to them; and when the visit was returned by the Middletons’ diningat the cottage, the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again.It must be so."
334,1,She was perfectly convinced of it.
335,1,"It would be anexcellent match, for _he_ was rich, and _she_ was handsome."
336,1,"Mrs.Jennings had been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married, eversince her connection with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge;and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl.The immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable, forit supplied her with endless jokes against them both."
337,1,"At the park shelaughed at the colonel, and in the cottage at Marianne."
338,1,"To the formerher raillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself,perfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at firstincomprehensible; and when its object was understood, she hardly knewwhether most to laugh at its absurdity, or censure its impertinence,for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel’sadvanced years, and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor.Mrs."
339,1,"Dashwood, who could not think a man five years younger thanherself, so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy ofher daughter, ventured to clear Mrs."
340,1,"Jennings from the probability ofwishing to throw ridicule on his age.“But at least, Mama, you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation,though you may not think it intentionally ill-natured."
341,1,Colonel Brandonis certainly younger than Mrs.
342,1,"Jennings, but he is old enough to be_my_ father; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love, musthave long outlived every sensation of the kind."
343,1,"It is too ridiculous!When is a man to be safe from such wit, if age and infirmity will notprotect him?”“Infirmity!” said Elinor, “do you call Colonel Brandon infirm? I caneasily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to mymother; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use ofhis limbs!”“Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism? and is not that thecommonest infirmity of declining life?”“My dearest child,” said her mother, laughing, “at this rate you mustbe in continual terror of _my_ decay; and it must seem to you a miraclethat my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty.”“Mama, you are not doing me justice."
344,1,I know very well that ColonelBrandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive oflosing him in the course of nature.
345,1,"He may live twenty years longer.But thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony.”“Perhaps,” said Elinor, “thirty-five and seventeen had better not haveany thing to do with matrimony together."
346,1,"But if there should by anychance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty, I shouldnot think Colonel Brandon’s being thirty-five any objection to hismarrying _her_.”“A woman of seven and twenty,” said Marianne, after pausing a moment,“can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her home beuncomfortable, or her fortune small, I can suppose that she might bringherself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of theprovision and security of a wife."
347,1,In his marrying such a womantherefore there would be nothing unsuitable.
348,1,"It would be a compact ofconvenience, and the world would be satisfied."
349,1,"In my eyes it would beno marriage at all, but that would be nothing."
350,1,"To me it would seem onlya commercial exchange, in which each wished to be benefited at theexpense of the other.”“It would be impossible, I know,” replied Elinor, “to convince you thata woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-fiveanything near enough to love, to make him a desirable companion to her.But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to theconstant confinement of a sick chamber, merely because he chanced tocomplain yesterday (a very cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic feel inone of his shoulders.”“But he talked of flannel waistcoats,” said Marianne; “and with me aflannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches, cramps,rheumatisms, and every species of ailment that can afflict the old andthe feeble.”“Had he been only in a violent fever, you would not have despised himhalf so much."
351,1,"Confess, Marianne, is not there something interesting toyou in the flushed cheek, hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?”Soon after this, upon Elinor’s leaving the room, “Mama,” said Marianne,“I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I cannot conceal fromyou."
352,1,I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well.
353,1,"We have now been here almosta fortnight, and yet he does not come."
354,1,Nothing but real indispositioncould occasion this extraordinary delay.
355,1,What else can detain him atNorland?”“Had you any idea of his coming so soon?” said Mrs.
356,1,Dashwood.
357,1,“_I_ hadnone.
358,1,"On the contrary, if I have felt any anxiety at all on thesubject, it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want ofpleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation, when I talked of hiscoming to Barton."
359,1,"Does Elinor expect him already?”“I have never mentioned it to her, but of course she must.”“I rather think you are mistaken, for when I was talking to heryesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber, she observedthat there was no immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely that theroom would be wanted for some time.”“How strange this is! what can be the meaning of it! But the whole oftheir behaviour to each other has been unaccountable! How cold, howcomposed were their last adieus! How languid their conversation thelast evening of their being together! In Edward’s farewell there was nodistinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes of anaffectionate brother to both."
360,1,"Twice did I leave them purposely togetherin the course of the last morning, and each time did he mostunaccountably follow me out of the room."
361,1,"And Elinor, in quittingNorland and Edward, cried not as I did."
362,1,Even now her self-command isinvariable.
363,1,"When is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try toavoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it?”CHAPTER IX.The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort tothemselves."
364,1,"The house and the garden, with all the objects surroundingthem, were now become familiar, and the ordinary pursuits which hadgiven to Norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greaterenjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the loss of theirfather."
365,1,"Sir John Middleton, who called on them every day for the firstfortnight, and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation athome, could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed.Their visitors, except those from Barton Park, were not many; for, inspite of Sir John’s urgent entreaties that they would mix more in theneighbourhood, and repeated assurances of his carriage being always attheir service, the independence of Mrs."
366,1,Dashwood’s spirit overcame thewish of society for her children; and she was resolute in declining tovisit any family beyond the distance of a walk.
367,1,"There were but few whocould be so classed; and it was not all of them that were attainable.About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow windingvalley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton, as formerlydescribed, the girls had, in one of their earliest walks, discovered anancient respectable looking mansion which, by reminding them a littleof Norland, interested their imagination and made them wish to bebetter acquainted with it."
368,1,"But they learnt, on enquiry, that itspossessor, an elderly lady of very good character, was unfortunatelytoo infirm to mix with the world, and never stirred from home.The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks."
369,1,"The highdowns which invited them from almost every window of the cottage toseek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits, were a happyalternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superiorbeauties; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret onememorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the partial sunshineof a showery sky, and unable longer to bear the confinement which thesettled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned."
370,1,"The weather wasnot tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and theirbook, in spite of Marianne’s declaration that the day would belastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would be drawn offfrom their hills; and the two girls set off together.They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration atevery glimpse of blue sky; and when they caught in their faces theanimating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fearswhich had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing suchdelightful sensations.“Is there a felicity in the world,” said Marianne, “superior tothis?—Margaret, we will walk here at least two hours.”Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind, resistingit with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer, when suddenlythe clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain set full intheir face."
371,1,"Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged, thoughunwillingly, to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their ownhouse."
372,1,"One consolation however remained for them, to which the exigenceof the moment gave more than usual propriety,—it was that of runningwith all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which ledimmediately to their garden gate.They set off."
373,1,"Marianne had at first the advantage, but a false stepbrought her suddenly to the ground; and Margaret, unable to stopherself to assist her, was involuntarily hurried along, and reached thebottom in safety.A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers playing round him, waspassing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne, when heraccident happened."
374,1,He put down his gun and ran to her assistance.
375,1,"Shehad raised herself from the ground, but her foot had been twisted inher fall, and she was scarcely able to stand."
376,1,"The gentleman offered hisservices; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situationrendered necessary, took her up in his arms without farther delay, andcarried her down the hill."
377,1,"Then passing through the garden, the gate ofwhich had been left open by Margaret, he bore her directly into thehouse, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not his hold tillhe had seated her in a chair in the parlour.Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance, and whilethe eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secretadmiration which equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized forhis intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so frank and sograceful that his person, which was uncommonly handsome, receivedadditional charms from his voice and expression."
378,1,"Had he been even old,ugly, and vulgar, the gratitude and kindness of Mrs."
379,1,"Dashwood wouldhave been secured by any act of attention to her child; but theinfluence of youth, beauty, and elegance, gave an interest to theaction which came home to her feelings.She thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness of address whichalways attended her, invited him to be seated."
380,1,"But this he declined, ashe was dirty and wet."
381,1,Mrs.
382,1,Dashwood then begged to know to whom she wasobliged.
383,1,"His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his present home wasat Allenham, from whence he hoped she would allow him the honour ofcalling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood."
384,1,"The honour was readilygranted, and he then departed, to make himself still more interesting,in the midst of a heavy rain.His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly thetheme of general admiration, and the laugh which his gallantry raisedagainst Marianne received particular spirit from his exteriorattractions."
385,1,"Marianne herself had seen less of his person than therest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his liftingher up, had robbed her of the power of regarding him after theirentering the house."
386,1,"But she had seen enough of him to join in all theadmiration of the others, and with an energy which always adorned herpraise."
387,1,"His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawnfor the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying her into thehouse with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity ofthought which particularly recommended the action to her."
388,1,Everycircumstance belonging to him was interesting.
389,1,"His name was good, hisresidence was in their favourite village, and she soon found out thatof all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming."
390,1,"Herimagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant, and the pain of asprained ankle was disregarded.Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weatherthat morning allowed him to get out of doors; and Marianne’s accidentbeing related to him, he was eagerly asked whether he knew anygentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.“Willoughby!” cried Sir John; “what, is _he_ in the country? That isgood news however; I will ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner onThursday.”“You know him then,” said Mrs."
391,1,Dashwood.“Know him! to be sure I do.
392,1,"Why, he is down here every year.”“And what sort of a young man is he?”“As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you."
393,1,"A very decentshot, and there is not a bolder rider in England.”“And is _that_ all you can say for him?” cried Marianne, indignantly.“But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance? What hispursuits, his talents, and genius?”Sir John was rather puzzled.“Upon my soul,” said he, “I do not know much about him as to all_that_."
394,1,"But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow, and has got thenicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw."
395,1,Was she out with himtoday?”But Marianne could no mo.
396,1,"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possessionof a good fortune must be in want of a wife.However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on hisfirst entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the mindsof the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightfulproperty of some one or other of their daughters.“My dear Mr."
397,1,"Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard thatNetherfield Park is let at last?”Mr."
398,1,"Bennet replied that he had not.“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs."
399,1,"Long has just been here, and shetold me all about it.”Mr."
400,1,"Bennet made no answer.“Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently.“_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”[Illustration:“He came down to see the place”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]This was invitation enough.“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs."
401,1,"Long says that Netherfield is takenby a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he camedown on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so muchdelighted with it that he agreed with Mr."
402,1,"Morris immediately; that he isto take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to bein the house by the end of next week.”“What is his name?”“Bingley.”“Is he married or single?”“Oh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four orfive thousand a year."
403,1,What a fine thing for our girls!”“How so? how can it affect them?”“My dear Mr.
404,1,"Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome? Youmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”“Is that his design in settling here?”“Design? Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him assoon as he comes.”“I see no occasion for that."
405,1,"You and the girls may go--or you may sendthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you areas handsome as any of them, Mr."
406,1,"Bingley might like you the best of theparty.”“My dear, you flatter me."
407,1,"I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, butI do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now."
408,1,"When a woman has fivegrown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr."
409,1,"Bingley when he comes intothe neighbourhood.”“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”“But consider your daughters."
410,1,Only think what an establishment it wouldbe for one of them.
411,1,"Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers."
412,1,"Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visithim, if you do not.”“You are over scrupulous, surely."
413,1,I dare say Mr.
414,1,Bingley will be veryglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of myhearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--thoughI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”“I desire you will do no such thing.
415,1,"Lizzy is not a bit better than theothers: and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half sogood-humoured as Lydia."
416,1,"But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they areall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more ofquickness than her sisters.”“Mr."
417,1,"Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You takedelight in vexing me."
418,1,"You have no compassion on my poor nerves.”“You mistake me, my dear."
419,1,I have a high respect for your nerves.
420,1,Theyare my old friends.
421,1,"I have heard you mention them with considerationthese twenty years at least.”“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of fourthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will notvisit them.”“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit themall.”Mr."
422,1,"Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years hadbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character."
423,1,_Her_ mindwas less difficult to develope.
424,1,"She was a woman of mean understanding,little information, and uncertain temper."
425,1,"When she was discontented, shefancied herself nervous."
426,1,The business of her life was to get herdaughters married: its solace was visiting and news.[Illustration: M^{r.} & M^{rs.} Bennet[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]][Illustration:“I hope Mr.
427,1,Bingley will like it”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER II.[Illustration]Mr.
428,1,Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.
429,1,Bingley.
430,1,"Hehad always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring hiswife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit waspaid she had no knowledge of it."
431,1,It was then disclosed in the followingmanner.
432,1,"Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, hesuddenly addressed her with,--“I hope Mr."
433,1,"Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”“We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr."
434,1,"Bingley likes,” said her mother,resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at theassemblies, and that Mrs."
435,1,Long has promised to introduce him.”“I do not believe Mrs.
436,1,Long will do any such thing.
437,1,She has two niecesof her own.
438,1,"She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinionof her.”“No more have I,” said Mr."
439,1,Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you donot depend on her serving you.”Mrs.
440,1,"Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to containherself, began scolding one of her daughters.“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a littlecompassion on my nerves."
441,1,"You tear them to pieces.”“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she timesthem ill.”“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty, fretfully."
442,1,"“Whenis your next ball to be, Lizzy?”“To-morrow fortnight.”“Ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs."
443,1,"Long does not come back tillthe day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, forshe will not know him herself.”“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduceMr."
444,1,"Bingley to _her_.”“Impossible, Mr."
445,1,"Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with himmyself; how can you be so teasing?”“I honour your circumspection."
446,1,A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainlyvery little.
447,1,One cannot know what a man really is by the end of afortnight.
448,1,"But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and afterall, Mrs."
449,1,"Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, Iwill take it on myself.”The girls stared at their father."
450,1,Mrs.
451,1,"Bennet said only, “Nonsense,nonsense!”“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he."
452,1,"“Doyou consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid onthem, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_."
453,1,"What say you,Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and readgreat books, and make extracts.”Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.Bingley.”“I am sick of Mr."
454,1,"Bingley,” cried his wife.“I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did you not tell me so before? If Ihad known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called onhim."
455,1,"It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, wecannot escape the acquaintance now.”The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished--that of Mrs.Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joywas over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all thewhile.“How good it was in you, my dear Mr."
456,1,Bennet! But I knew I shouldpersuade you at last.
457,1,I was sure you loved your girls too well toneglect such an acquaintance.
458,1,"Well, how pleased I am! And it is such agood joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said aword about it till now.”“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr."
459,1,"Bennet; and,as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.“What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door wasshut."
460,1,"“I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;or me either, for that matter."
461,1,"At our time of life, it is not sopleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; butfor your sakes we would do anything."
462,1,"Lydia, my love, though you _are_the youngest, I dare say Mr."
463,1,"Bingley will dance with you at the nextball.”“Oh,” said Lydia, stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ theyoungest, I’m the tallest.”The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he wouldreturn Mr."
464,1,"Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him todinner.[Illustration: “I’m the tallest”][Illustration:     “He rode a black horse”]CHAPTER III.[Illustration]Not all that Mrs."
465,1,"Bennet, however, with the assistance of her fivedaughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from herhusband any satisfactory description of Mr."
466,1,Bingley.
467,1,"They attacked himin various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, anddistant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were atlast obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,Lady Lucas."
468,1,Her report was highly favourable.
469,1,Sir William had beendelighted with him.
470,1,"He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremelyagreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assemblywith a large party."
471,1,Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond ofdancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very livelyhopes of Mr.
472,1,"Bingley’s heart were entertained.“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”said Mrs."
473,1,"Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally wellmarried, I shall have nothing to wish for.”In a few days Mr."
474,1,Bingley returned Mr.
475,1,"Bennet’s visit, and sat about tenminutes with him in his library."
476,1,"He had entertained hopes of beingadmitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heardmuch; but he saw only the father."
477,1,"The ladies were somewhat morefortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upperwindow, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already hadMrs."
478,1,"Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to herhousekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all."
479,1,Mr.
480,1,"Bingleywas obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable toaccept the honour of their invitation, etc."
481,1,Mrs.
482,1,Bennet was quitedisconcerted.
483,1,"She could not imagine what business he could have in townso soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear thathe might always be flying about from one place to another, and neversettled at Netherfield as he ought to be."
484,1,Lady Lucas quieted her fears alittle by starting the idea of his[Illustration:     “When the Party entered”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and areport soon followed that Mr.
485,1,Bingley was to bring twelve ladies andseven gentlemen with him to the assembly.
486,1,"The girls grieved over such anumber of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearingthat, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London,his five sisters and a cousin."
487,1,"And when the party entered theassembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr."
488,1,"Bingley, histwo sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.Mr."
489,1,"Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasantcountenance, and easy, unaffected manners."
490,1,"His sisters were fine women,with an air of decided fashion."
491,1,"His brother-in-law, Mr."
492,1,"Hurst, merelylooked the gentleman; but his friend Mr."
493,1,"Darcy soon drew the attentionof the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, andthe report, which was in general circulation within five minutes afterhis entrance, of his having ten thousand a year."
494,1,"The gentlemenpronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he wasmuch handsomer than Mr."
495,1,"Bingley, and he was looked at with greatadmiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgustwhich turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to beproud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all hislarge estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding,disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with hisfriend.Mr."
496,1,"Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principalpeople in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving onehimself at Netherfield."
497,1,Such amiable qualities must speak forthemselves.
498,1,What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr.
499,1,Darcy dancedonly once with Mrs.
500,1,"Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined beingintroduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening inwalking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.His character was decided."
501,1,"He was the proudest, most disagreeable man inthe world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs."
502,1,"Bennet, whose dislike ofhis general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by hishaving slighted one of her daughters.Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sitdown for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr."
503,1,Darcy had beenstanding near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him andMr.
504,1,"Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press hisfriend to join it.“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance."
505,1,I hate to see youstanding about by yourself in this stupid manner.
506,1,You had much betterdance.”“I certainly shall not.
507,1,"You know how I detest it, unless I amparticularly acquainted with my partner."
508,1,"At such an assembly as this, itwould be insupportable."
509,1,"Your sisters are engaged, and there is notanother woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me tostand up with.”“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley, “for akingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in mylife as I have this evening; and there are several of them, you see,uncommonly pretty.”“_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.“Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is oneof her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and Idare say very agreeable."
510,1,"Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”[Illustration:“She is tolerable”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]“Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment atElizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own, and coldly said,“She is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in nohumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slightedby other men."
511,1,"You had better return to your partner and enjoy hersmiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”Mr."
512,1,Bingley followed his advice.
513,1,Mr.
514,1,Darcy walked off; and Elizabethremained with no very cordial feelings towards him.
515,1,"She told the story,however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family."
516,1,Mrs.Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfieldparty.
517,1,Mr.
518,1,"Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had beendistinguished by his sisters."
519,1,"Jane was as much gratified by this as hermother could be, though in a quieter way."
520,1,Elizabeth felt Jane’spleasure.
521,1,"Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the mostaccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had beenfortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that theyhad yet learnt to care for at a ball."
522,1,"They returned, therefore, in goodspirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which theywere the principal inhabitants."
523,1,They found Mr.
524,1,Bennet still up.
525,1,"With abook, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had agood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raisedsuch splendid expectations."
526,1,"He had rather hoped that all his wife’sviews on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that hehad a very different story to hear.“Oh, my dear Mr."
527,1,"Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a mostdelightful evening, a most excellent ball."
528,1,"I wish you had been there.Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it."
529,1,Everybody said how wellshe looked; and Mr.
530,1,"Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced withher twice."
531,1,"Only think of _that_, my dear: he actually danced with hertwice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a secondtime."
532,1,"First of all, he asked Miss Lucas."
533,1,"I was so vexed to see him standup with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobodycan, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was goingdown the dance."
534,1,"So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, andasked her for the two next."
535,1,"Then, the two third he danced with MissKing, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Janeagain, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_----”“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,“he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more ofhis partners."
536,1,"O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”“Oh, my dear,” continued Mrs."
537,1,"Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him."
538,1,Heis so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women.
539,1,I neverin my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses.
540,1,I dare say thelace upon Mrs.
541,1,Hurst’s gown----”Here she was interrupted again.
542,1,Mr.
543,1,Bennet protested against anydescription of finery.
544,1,"She was therefore obliged to seek another branchof the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and someexaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr."
545,1,"Darcy.“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by notsuiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not atall worth pleasing."
546,1,"So high and so conceited, that there was no enduringhim! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so verygreat! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, mydear, to have given him one of your set-downs."
547,1,"I quite detest the man.”[Illustration]CHAPTER IV.[Illustration]When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious inher praise of Mr."
548,1,"Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very muchshe admired him.“He is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! so much ease,with such perfect good breeding!”“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man oughtlikewise to be if he possibly can."
549,1,His character is thereby complete.”“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.
550,1,Idid not expect such a compliment.”“Did not you? _I_ did for you.
551,1,But that is one great difference betweenus.
552,1,"Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never."
553,1,Whatcould be more natural than his asking you again? He could not helpseeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman inthe room.
554,1,No thanks to his gallantry for that.
555,1,"Well, he certainly isvery agreeable, and I give you leave to like him."
556,1,"You have liked many astupider person.”“Dear Lizzy!”“Oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.You never see a fault in anybody."
557,1,All the world are good and agreeablein your eyes.
558,1,I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.”“I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speakwhat I think.”“I know you do: and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.
559,1,"With _your_good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense ofothers! Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with iteverywhere."
560,1,"But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take thegood of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothingof the bad,--belongs to you alone."
561,1,"And so, you like this man’s sisters,too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”“Certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when youconverse with them."
562,1,"Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keephis house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charmingneighbour in her.”Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour atthe assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with morequickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, andwith a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she wasvery little disposed to approve them."
563,1,"They were, in fact, very fineladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in thepower of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.They were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first privateseminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in thehabit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with peopleof rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well ofthemselves and meanly of others."
564,1,They were of a respectable family inthe north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on theirmemories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had beenacquired by trade.Mr.
565,1,"Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundredthousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,but did not live to do it."
566,1,Mr.
567,1,"Bingley intended it likewise, andsometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with agood house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of thosewho best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend theremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation topurchase.His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; butthough he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by nomeans unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs."
568,1,"Hurst, who hadmarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to considerhis house as her home when it suited her."
569,1,Mr.
570,1,"Bingley had not been ofage two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, tolook at Netherfield House."
571,1,"He did look at it, and into it, for half anhour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfiedwith what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of agreat opposition of character."
572,1,"Bingley was endeared to Darcy by theeasiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no dispositioncould offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own henever appeared dissatisfied."
573,1,"On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingleyhad the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion."
574,1,"Inunderstanding, Darcy was the superior."
575,1,Bingley was by no meansdeficient; but Darcy was clever.
576,1,"He was at the same time haughty,reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were notinviting."
577,1,In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.
578,1,Bingleywas sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continuallygiving offence.The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficientlycharacteristic.
579,1,"Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettiergirls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquaintedwith all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angelmore beautiful."
580,1,"Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of peoplein whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he hadfelt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention orpleasure."
581,1,Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled toomuch.Mrs.
582,1,"Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admiredher and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whomthey should not object to know more of."
583,1,Miss Bennet was thereforeestablished as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by suchcommendation to think of her as he chose.[Illustration: [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER V.[Illustration]Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennetswere particularly intimate.
584,1,"Sir William Lucas had been formerly in tradein Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to thehonour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty."
585,1,"Thedistinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly."
586,1,"It had given him adisgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town;and, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house abouta mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where hecould think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled bybusiness, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world."
587,1,"For,though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on thecontrary, he was all attention to everybody."
588,1,"By nature inoffensive,friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St."
589,1,"James’s had made himcourteous.Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be avaluable neighbour to Mrs."
590,1,Bennet.
591,1,They had several children.
592,1,"The eldestof them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, wasElizabeth’s intimate friend.That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over aball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assemblybrought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.“_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs."
593,1,"Bennet, with civilself-command, to Miss Lucas."
594,1,“_You_ were Mr.
595,1,"Bingley’s first choice.”“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”“Oh, you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice."
596,1,"To besure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed, I rather believe he_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--somethingabout Mr."
597,1,Robinson.”“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr.
598,1,Robinson: did notI mention it to you? Mr.
599,1,"Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Merytonassemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many prettywomen in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and hisanswering immediately to the last question, ‘Oh, the eldest Miss Bennet,beyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”“Upon my word! Well, that was very decided, indeed--that does seem asif--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”“_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” saidCharlotte."
600,1,“Mr.
601,1,"Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,is he? Poor Eliza! to be only just _tolerable_.”“I beg you will not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by hisill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quitea misfortune to be liked by him."
602,1,Mrs.
603,1,"Long told me last night that hesat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.”[Illustration: “Without once opening his lips”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]“Are you quite sure, ma’am? Is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.“I certainly saw Mr."
604,1,"Darcy speaking to her.”“Ay, because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and hecould not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at beingspoke to.”“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much unlessamong his intimate acquaintance."
605,1,"With _them_ he is remarkablyagreeable.”“I do not believe a word of it, my dear."
606,1,"If he had been so veryagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs."
607,1,Long.
608,1,"But I can guess how itwas; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he hadheard somehow that Mrs."
609,1,"Long does not keep a carriage, and had to cometo the ball in a hack chaise.”“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs."
610,1,"Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but Iwish he had danced with Eliza.”“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with _him_,if I were you.”“I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.”“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as prideoften does, because there is an excuse for it."
611,1,"One cannot wonder that sovery fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,should think highly of himself."
612,1,"If I may so express it, he has a _right_to be proud.”“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of herreflections, “is a very common failing, I believe."
613,1,"By all that I haveever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that humannature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of uswho do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of somequality or other, real or imaginary."
614,1,"Vanity and pride are differentthings, though the words are often used synonymously."
615,1,A person may beproud without being vain.
616,1,Pride relates more to our opinion ofourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.”“If I were as rich as Mr.
617,1,"Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with hissisters, “I should not care how proud I was."
618,1,"I would keep a pack offoxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottledirectly.”The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that shewould; and the argument ended only with the visit.[Illustration][Illustration]CHAPTER VI.[Illustration]The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield."
619,1,The visitwas returned in due form.
620,1,Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on thegood-will of Mrs.
621,1,"Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother wasfound to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards thetwo eldest."
622,1,"By Jane this attention was received with the greatestpleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment ofeverybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration."
623,1,"Itwas generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; andto _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preferencewhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in away to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that itwas not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Janeunited with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and anuniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from thesuspicions of the impertinent."
624,1,"She mentioned this to her friend, MissLucas.“It may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to imposeon the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to beso very guarded."
625,1,"If a woman conceals her affection with the same skillfrom the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; andit will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in thedark."
626,1,"There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost everyattachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself."
627,1,We can all_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there arevery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love withoutencouragement.
628,1,"In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_affection than she feels."
629,1,"Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but hemay never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow."
630,1,"If _I_ canperceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not todiscover it too.”“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to concealit, he must find it out.”“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her."
631,1,"But though Bingley and Janemeet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as theyalways see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible thatevery moment should be employed in conversing together."
632,1,Jane shouldtherefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command hisattention.
633,1,"When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for fallingin love as much as she chooses.”“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is inquestion but the desire of being well married; and if I were determinedto get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it."
634,1,Butthese are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design.
635,1,"As yet shecannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of itsreasonableness."
636,1,She has known him only a fortnight.
637,1,"She danced fourdances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,and has since dined in company with him four times."
638,1,This is not quiteenough to make her understand his character.”“Not as you represent it.
639,1,"Had she merely _dined_ with him, she mightonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you mustremember that four evenings have been also spent together--and fourevenings may do a great deal.”“Yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they bothlike Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any otherleading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and ifshe were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good achance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for atwelvemonth."
640,1,Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.
641,1,"Ifthe dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, orever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in theleast."
642,1,"They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards tohave their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little aspossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass yourlife.”“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound."
643,1,"You know it is notsound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”Occupied in observing Mr."
644,1,"Bingley’s attention to her sister, Elizabethwas far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of someinterest in the eyes of his friend."
645,1,Mr.
646,1,"Darcy had at first scarcelyallowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at theball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise."
647,1,"But nosooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hadhardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendereduncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes."
648,1,Tothis discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.
649,1,"Though he haddetected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetryin her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light andpleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not thoseof the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness."
650,1,"Ofthis she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who madehimself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enoughto dance with.He began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversingwith her himself, attended to her conversation with others."
651,1,His doing sodrew her notice.
652,1,"It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party wereassembled.“What does Mr."
653,1,"Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to myconversation with Colonel Forster?”“That is a question which Mr."
654,1,"Darcy only can answer.”“But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I seewhat he is about."
655,1,"He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin bybeing impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”[Illustration: “The entreaties of several” [_Copyright 1894 by GeorgeAllen._]]On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to haveany intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention sucha subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, sheturned to him and said,--“Did not you think, Mr."
656,1,"Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly welljust now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball atMeryton?”“With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a ladyenergetic.”“You are severe on us.”“It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas."
657,1,"“I am goingto open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting meto play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken amusical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I wouldreally rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit ofhearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however,she added, “Very well; if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancingat Mr."
658,1,"Darcy, “There is a very fine old saying, which everybody here isof course familiar with--‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--andI shall keep mine to swell my song.”Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital."
659,1,"After a songor two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that shewould sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by hersister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one inthe family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was alwaysimpatient for display.Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given herapplication, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceitedmanner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than shehad reached."
660,1,"Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to withmuch more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at theend of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude byScotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who withsome of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly indancing at one end of the room.Mr."
661,1,"Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode ofpassing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was toomuch engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucaswas his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:--“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr."
662,1,"Darcy! There isnothing like dancing, after all."
663,1,"I consider it as one of the firstrefinements of polished societies.”“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongstthe less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”Sir William only smiled."
664,1,"“Your friend performs delightfully,” hecontinued, after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubtnot that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr."
665,1,"Darcy.”“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight."
666,1,Doyou often dance at St.
667,1,"James’s?”“Never, sir.”“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”“You have a house in town, I conclude?”Mr."
668,1,"Darcy bowed.“I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for I am fond ofsuperior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air ofLondon would agree with Lady Lucas.”He paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed tomake any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he wasstruck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out toher,--“My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr."
669,1,"Darcy, you must allowme to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner."
670,1,"Youcannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.”And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr."
671,1,"Darcy, who, thoughextremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantlydrew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,--“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing."
672,1,I entreat younot to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”Mr.
673,1,"Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour ofher hand, but in vain."
674,1,"Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William atall shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny methe happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes theamusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige usfor one half hour.”“Mr."
675,1,"Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.“He is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, wecannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such apartner?”Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away."
676,1,"Her resistance had not injuredher with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with somecomplacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,--“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”“I should imagine not.”“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass manyevenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, I am quite ofyour opinion."
677,1,"I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet thenoise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all thesepeople! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you."
678,1,My mind was moreagreeably engaged.
679,1,"I have been meditating on the very great pleasurewhich a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired hewould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.Mr."
680,1,"Darcy replied, with great intrepidity,--“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley."
681,1,“I am all astonishment.How long has she been such a favourite? and pray when am I to wish youjoy?”“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.
682,1,"A lady’simagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from loveto matrimony, in a moment."
683,1,"I knew you would be wishing me joy.”“Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter asabsolutely settled."
684,1,"You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, andof course she will be always at Pemberley with you.”He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose toentertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced herthat all was safe, her wit flowed along.[Illustration:     “A note for Miss Bennet”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER VII.[Illustration]Mr."
685,1,"Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of twothousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’sfortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supplythe deficiency of his."
686,1,"Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, andhad left her four thousand pounds.She had a sister married to a Mr."
687,1,"Philips, who had been a clerk to theirfather and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled inLondon in a respectable line of trade.The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a mostconvenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually temptedthither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, andto a milliner’s shop just over the way."
688,1,"The two youngest of the family,Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothingbetter offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morninghours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare ofnews the country in general might be, they always contrived to learnsome from their aunt."
689,1,"At present, indeed, they were well supplied bothwith news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment inthe neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton wasthe head-quarters.Their visits to Mrs."
690,1,Philips were now productive of the most interestingintelligence.
691,1,Every day added something to their knowledge of theofficers’ names and connections.
692,1,"Their lodgings were not long a secret,and at length they began to know the officers themselves."
693,1,Mr.
694,1,"Philipsvisited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicityunknown before."
695,1,"They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to theirmother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals ofan ensign.After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.Bennet coolly observed,--“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be twoof the silliest girls in the country."
696,1,"I have suspected it some time, butI am now convinced.”Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfectindifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, andher hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going thenext morning to London.“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs."
697,1,"Bennet, “that you should be soready to think your own children silly."
698,1,"If I wished to think slightinglyof anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”“Yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree."
699,1,"Ihad hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I mustso far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonlyfoolish.”“My dear Mr."
700,1,"Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense oftheir father and mother."
701,1,"When they get to our age, I dare say they willnot think about officers any more than we do."
702,1,"I remember the time when Iliked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at myheart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thoughtColonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s inhis regimentals.”“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and CaptainCarter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they firstcame; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”Mrs."
703,1,"Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with anote for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waitedfor an answer."
704,1,Mrs.
705,1,"Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she waseagerly calling out, while her daughter read,--“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud."
706,1,"    /* NIND “My dear friend, */     “If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our     lives; for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never     end without a quarrel."
707,1,Come as soon as you can on the receipt of     this.
708,1,My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.
709,1,"    Yours ever,“CAROLINE BINGLEY.”“With the officers!” cried Lydia: “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of_that_.”“Dining out,” said Mrs."
710,1,"Bennet; “that is very unlucky.”“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely torain; and then you must stay all night.”“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure thatthey would not offer to send her home.”“Oh, but the gentlemen will have Mr."
711,1,"Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton;and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”“I had much rather go in the coach.”“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure."
712,1,"They arewanted in the farm, Mr."
713,1,"Bennet, are not they?”[Illustration: Cheerful prognostics]“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purposewill be answered.”She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horseswere engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and hermother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a badday."
714,1,Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before itrained hard.
715,1,"Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother wasdelighted."
716,1,"The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;Jane certainly could not come back.“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs."
717,1,"Bennet, more thanonce, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own."
718,1,"Till the nextmorning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of hercontrivance."
719,1,"Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfieldbrought the following note for Elizabeth:--     /* NIND “My dearest Lizzie, */     “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday."
720,1,My kind friends will     not hear of my returning home till I am better.
721,1,They insist also on     my seeing Mr.
722,1,"Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear     of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and a     headache, there is not much the matter with me.“Yours, etc.”“Well, my dear,” said Mr."
723,1,"Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the notealoud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if sheshould die--it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit ofMr."
724,1,"Bingley, and under your orders.”“Oh, I am not at all afraid of her dying."
725,1,People do not die of littletrifling colds.
726,1,She will be taken good care of.
727,1,"As long as she staysthere, it is all very well."
728,1,"I would go and see her if I could have thecarriage.”Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though thecarriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking washer only alternative."
729,1,"She declared her resolution.“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such athing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you getthere.”“I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for thehorses?”“No, indeed."
730,1,I do not wish to avoid the walk.
731,1,"The distance is nothing,when one has a motive; only three miles."
732,1,"I shall be back by dinner.”“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but everyimpulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set offtogether.“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we maysee something of Captain Carter, before he goes.”In Meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of oneof the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossingfield after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springingover puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at lastwithin view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a faceglowing with the warmth of exercise.She was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane wereassembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in suchdirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs."
733,1,Hurst andMiss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contemptfor it.
734,1,"She was received, however, very politely by them; and in theirbrother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there wasgood-humour and kindness."
735,1,Mr.
736,1,"Darcy said very little, and Mr."
737,1,Hurstnothing at all.
738,1,The former was divided between admiration of thebrilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as tothe occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone.
739,1,The latter wasthinking only of his breakfast.Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.
740,1,"MissBennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not wellenough to leave her room."
741,1,"Elizabeth was glad to be taken to herimmediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of givingalarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longedfor such a visit, was delighted at her entrance."
742,1,"She was not equal,however, to much conversation; and when Miss Bingley left them together,could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for theextraordinary kindness she was treated with."
743,1,"Elizabeth silently attendedher.When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabethbegan to like them herself, when she saw how much affection andsolicitude they showed for Jane."
744,1,"The apothecary came; and havingexamined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught aviolent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts."
745,1,"The advicewas followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her headached acutely."
746,1,"Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor werethe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in factnothing to do elsewhere.When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and veryunwillingly said so."
747,1,"Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she onlywanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concernat parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offerof the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for thepresent."
748,1,"Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant wasdespatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bringback a supply of clothes.[Illustration:“The Apothecary came”][Illustration:“covering a screen”]CHAPTER VIII.[Illustration]At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past sixElizabeth was summoned to dinner."
749,1,"To the civil inquiries which thenpoured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing themuch superior solicitude of Mr."
750,1,"Bingley, she could not make a veryfavourable answer."
751,1,Jane was by no means better.
752,1,"The sisters, on hearingthis, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, howshocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they dislikedbeing ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and theirindifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restoredElizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she couldregard with any complacency."
753,1,"His anxiety for Jane was evident, and hisattentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feelingherself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by theothers."
754,1,She had very little notice from any but him.
755,1,Miss Bingley wasengrossed by Mr.
756,1,"Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only toeat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plaindish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingleybegan abusing her as soon as she was out of the room."
757,1,"Her manners werepronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence:she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty."
758,1,Mrs.
759,1,"Hurstthought the same, and added,--“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellentwalker."
760,1,I shall never forget her appearance this morning.
761,1,"She reallylooked almost wild.”“She did indeed, Louisa."
762,1,I could hardly keep my countenance.
763,1,"Verynonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about thecountry, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deepin mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down tohide it not doing its office.”“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this wasall lost upon me."
764,1,I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably wellwhen she came into the room this morning.
765,1,"Her dirty petticoat quiteescaped my notice.”“_You_ observed it, Mr."
766,1,"Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I aminclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make suchan exhibition.”“Certainly not.”“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean byit? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,a most country-town indifference to decorum.”“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” saidBingley.“I am afraid, Mr."
767,1,"Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fineeyes.”“Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” Ashort pause followed this speech, and Mrs."
768,1,"Hurst began again,--“I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweetgirl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled."
769,1,"But with sucha father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is nochance of it.”“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney inMeryton?”“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”“That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “itwould not make them one jot less agreeable.”“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of anyconsideration in the world,” replied Darcy.To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it theirhearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense oftheir dear friend’s vulgar relations.With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room onleaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, tilllate in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, andwhen it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should godown stairs herself."
770,1,"On entering the drawing-room, she found the wholeparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspectingthem to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister theexcuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could staybelow, with a book."
771,1,Mr.
772,1,"Hurst looked at her with astonishment.“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards."
773,1,"She is a greatreader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “Iam _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “andI hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a tablewhere a few books were lying."
774,1,"He immediately offered to fetch herothers; all that his library afforded.“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my owncredit; but I am an idle fellow; and though I have not many, I have morethan I ever looked into.”Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with thosein the room.“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have leftso small a collection of books."
775,1,"What a delightful library you have atPemberley, Mr."
776,1,"Darcy!”“It ought to be good,” he replied: “it has been the work of manygenerations.”“And then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buyingbooks.”“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days asthese.”“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties ofthat noble place."
777,1,"Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may behalf as delightful as Pemberley.”“I wish it may.”“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in thatneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model."
778,1,"There is not afiner county in England than Derbyshire.”“With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.”“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to getPemberley by purchase than by imitation.”Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very littleattention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew nearthe card-table, and stationed herself between Mr."
779,1,"Bingley and his eldestsister, to observe the game.“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley: “willshe be as tall as I am?”“I think she will."
780,1,"She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, orrather taller.”“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted meso much."
781,1,"Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplishedfor her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patienceto be so very accomplished as they all are.”“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”“Yes, all of them, I think."
782,1,"They all paint tables, cover screens, andnet purses."
783,1,"I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and I amsure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, withoutbeing informed that she was very accomplished.”“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “hastoo much truth."
784,1,The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it nootherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am veryfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.
785,1,"Icannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of myacquaintance that are really accomplished.”“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in youridea of an accomplished woman.”“Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.”“Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be reallyesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually metwith."
786,1,"A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides allthis, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner ofwalking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the wordwill be but half deserved.”“All this she must possess,” added Darcy; “and to all she must yet addsomething more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensivereading.”“I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of allthis?”“_I_ never saw such a woman."
787,1,"_I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, andapplication, and elegance, as you describe, united.”Mrs."
788,1,"Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of herimplied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women whoanswered this description, when Mr."
789,1,"Hurst called them to order, withbitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward."
790,1,"As allconversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left theroom.“Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “isone of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the othersex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I daresay, itsucceeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,“there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescendto employ for captivation."
791,1,"Whatever bears affinity to cunning isdespicable.”Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as tocontinue the subject.Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, andthat she could not leave her."
792,1,Bingley urged Mr.
793,1,"Jones’s being sent forimmediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice couldbe of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the mosteminent physicians."
794,1,This she would not hear of; but she was not sounwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settledthat Mr.
795,1,"Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennetwere not decidedly better."
796,1,Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sistersdeclared that they were miserable.
797,1,"They solaced their wretchedness,however, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief tohis feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that everypossible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.[Illustration:M^{rs} Bennet and her two youngest girls[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER IX.[Illustration]Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in themorning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to theinquiries which she very early received from Mr."
798,1,"Bingley by a housemaid,and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on hissisters."
799,1,"In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have anote sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form herown judgment of her situation."
800,1,"The note was immediately despatched, andits contents as quickly complied with."
801,1,Mrs.
802,1,"Bennet, accompanied by hertwo youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs."
803,1,"Bennet would have beenvery miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness wasnot alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as herrestoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield."
804,1,"Shewould not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carriedhome; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, thinkit at all advisable."
805,1,"After sitting a little while with Jane, on MissBingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters allattended her into the breakfast parlour."
806,1,Bingley met them with hopesthat Mrs.
807,1,"Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer."
808,1,“She is a great deal too ill to bemoved.
809,1,Mr.
810,1,Jones says we must not think of moving her.
811,1,We must trespassa little longer on your kindness.”“Removed!” cried Bingley.
812,1,“It must not be thought of.
813,1,"My sister, I amsure, will not hear of her removal.”“You may depend upon it, madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,“that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while sheremains with us.”Mrs."
814,1,"Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, I do notknow what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers avast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which isalways the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetesttemper I ever met with."
815,1,I often tell my other girls they are nothing to_her_.
816,1,"You have a sweet room here, Mr."
817,1,"Bingley, and a charming prospectover that gravel walk."
818,1,I do not know a place in the country that isequal to Netherfield.
819,1,"You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, Ihope, though you have but a short lease.”“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if Ishould resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in fiveminutes."
820,1,"At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.“Oh yes--I understand you perfectly.”“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seenthrough, I am afraid, is pitiful.”“That is as it happens."
821,1,"It does not necessarily follow that a deep,intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on inthe wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”“I did not know before,” continued Bingley, immediately, “that you werea studier of character."
822,1,It must be an amusing study.”“Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.
823,1,"They have atleast that advantage.”“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects forsuch a study."
824,1,"In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined andunvarying society.”“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to beobserved in them for ever.”“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs."
825,1,"Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning acountry neighbourhood."
826,1,"“I assure you there is quite as much of _that_going on in the country as in town.”Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,turned silently away."
827,1,Mrs.
828,1,"Bennet, who fancied she had gained a completevictory over him, continued her triumph,--“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, formy part, except the shops and public places."
829,1,"The country is a vast dealpleasanter, is not it, Mr."
830,1,"Bingley?”“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; andwhen I am in town, it is pretty much the same."
831,1,"They have each theiradvantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”“Ay, that is because you have the right disposition."
832,1,"But thatgentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothingat all.”“Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for hermother."
833,1,“You quite mistook Mr.
834,1,Darcy.
835,1,"He only meant that there was notsuch a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, whichyou must acknowledge to be true.”“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting withmany people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are fewneighbourhoods larger."
836,1,I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep hiscountenance.
837,1,"His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towardsMr."
838,1,Darcy with a very expressive smile.
839,1,"Elizabeth, for the sake ofsaying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her ifCharlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.“Yes, she called yesterday with her father."
840,1,"What an agreeable man SirWilliam is, Mr."
841,1,Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! sogenteel and so easy! He has always something to say to everybody.
842,1,"_That_is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves veryimportant and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.”“Did Charlotte dine with you?”“No, she would go home."
843,1,I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies.
844,1,"Formy part, Mr."
845,1,"Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their ownwork; _my_ daughters are brought up differently."
846,1,"But everybody is tojudge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, Iassure you."
847,1,"It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ thinkCharlotte so _very_ plain; but then she is our particular friend.”“She seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley.“Oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain."
848,1,"Lady Lucas herselfhas often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty."
849,1,"I do not like to boastof my own child; but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybodybetter looking."
850,1,It is what everybody says.
851,1,I do not trust my ownpartiality.
852,1,"When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at mybrother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that mysister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.But, however, he did not."
853,1,Perhaps he thought her too young.
854,1,"However, hewrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth, impatiently."
855,1,"“There hasbeen many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way."
856,1,"I wonder who firstdiscovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”“I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may."
857,1,Everything nourishes what isstrong already.
858,1,"But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, Iam convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabethtremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again."
859,1,"She longed tospeak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr."
860,1,"Bingley for his kindness toJane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy."
861,1,Mr.
862,1,"Bingley wasunaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to becivil also, and say what the occasion required."
863,1,"She performed her part,indeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs."
864,1,"Bennet was satisfied, andsoon afterwards ordered her carriage."
865,1,"Upon this signal, the youngest ofher daughters put herself forward."
866,1,"The two girls had been whispering toeach other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that theyoungest should tax Mr."
867,1,"Bingley with having promised on his first cominginto the country to give a ball at Netherfield.Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexionand good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whoseaffection had brought her into public at an early age."
868,1,"She had highanimal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which theattentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and herown easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance."
869,1,"She wasvery equal, therefore, to address Mr."
870,1,"Bingley on the subject of theball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it wo."
871,1,"About thirty years ago Miss Maria Ward, of Huntingdon, with only seventhousand pounds, had the good luck to captivate Sir Thomas Bertram, ofMansfield Park, in the county of Northampton, and to be thereby raisedto the rank of a baronet’s lady, with all the comforts and consequencesof an handsome house and large income."
872,1,"All Huntingdon exclaimed on thegreatness of the match, and her uncle, the lawyer, himself, allowed herto be at least three thousand pounds short of any equitable claim toit."
873,1,"She had two sisters to be benefited by her elevation; and such oftheir acquaintance as thought Miss Ward and Miss Frances quite ashandsome as Miss Maria, did not scruple to predict their marrying withalmost equal advantage."
874,1,"But there certainly are not so many men oflarge fortune in the world as there are pretty women to deserve them.Miss Ward, at the end of half a dozen years, found herself obliged tobe attached to the Rev."
875,1,Mr.
876,1,"Norris, a friend of her brother-in-law,with scarcely any private fortune, and Miss Frances fared yet worse.Miss Ward’s match, indeed, when it came to the point, was notcontemptible: Sir Thomas being happily able to give his friend anincome in the living of Mansfield; and Mr."
877,1,and Mrs.
878,1,Norris began theircareer of conjugal felicity with very little less than a thousand ayear.
879,1,"But Miss Frances married, in the common phrase, to disoblige herfamily, and by fixing on a lieutenant of marines, without education,fortune, or connexions, did it very thoroughly."
880,1,She could hardly havemade a more untoward choice.
881,1,"Sir Thomas Bertram had interest, which,from principle as well as pride—from a general wish of doing right, anda desire of seeing all that were connected with him in situations ofrespectability, he would have been glad to exert for the advantage ofLady Bertram’s sister; but her husband’s profession was such as nointerest could reach; and before he had time to devise any other methodof assisting them, an absolute breach between the sisters had takenplace."
882,1,"It was the natural result of the conduct of each party, and suchas a very imprudent marriage almost always produces."
883,1,"To save herselffrom useless remonstrance, Mrs."
884,1,Price never wrote to her family on thesubject till actually married.
885,1,"Lady Bertram, who was a woman of verytranquil feelings, and a temper remarkably easy and indolent, wouldhave contented herself with merely giving up her sister, and thinkingno more of the matter; but Mrs."
886,1,"Norris had a spirit of activity, whichcould not be satisfied till she had written a long and angry letter toFanny, to point out the folly of her conduct, and threaten her with allits possible ill consequences."
887,1,Mrs.
888,1,"Price, in her turn, was injured andangry; and an answer, which comprehended each sister in its bitterness,and bestowed such very disrespectful reflections on the pride of SirThomas as Mrs."
889,1,"Norris could not possibly keep to herself, put an end toall intercourse between them for a considerable period.Their homes were so distant, and the circles in which they moved sodistinct, as almost to preclude the means of ever hearing of eachother’s existence during the eleven following years, or, at least, tomake it very wonderful to Sir Thomas that Mrs."
890,1,"Norris should ever haveit in her power to tell them, as she now and then did, in an angryvoice, that Fanny had got another child."
891,1,"By the end of eleven years,however, Mrs."
892,1,"Price could no longer afford to cherish pride orresentment, or to lose one connexion that might possibly assist her."
893,1,"Alarge and still increasing family, an husband disabled for activeservice, but not the less equal to company and good liquor, and a verysmall income to supply their wants, made her eager to regain thefriends she had so carelessly sacrificed; and she addressed LadyBertram in a letter which spoke so much contrition and despondence,such a superfluity of children, and such a want of almost everythingelse, as could not but dispose them all to a reconciliation."
894,1,"She waspreparing for her ninth lying-in; and after bewailing the circumstance,and imploring their countenance as sponsors to the expected child, shecould not conceal how important she felt they might be to the futuremaintenance of the eight already in being."
895,1,"Her eldest was a boy of tenyears old, a fine spirited fellow, who longed to be out in the world;but what could she do? Was there any chance of his being hereafteruseful to Sir Thomas in the concerns of his West Indian property? Nosituation would be beneath him; or what did Sir Thomas think ofWoolwich? or how could a boy be sent out to the East?The letter was not unproductive."
896,1,"It re-established peace and kindness.Sir Thomas sent friendly advice and professions, Lady Bertramdispatched money and baby-linen, and Mrs."
897,1,"Norris wrote the letters.Such were its immediate effects, and within a twelvemonth a moreimportant advantage to Mrs."
898,1,Price resulted from it.
899,1,Mrs.
900,1,"Norris wasoften observing to the others that she could not get her poor sisterand her family out of her head, and that, much as they had all done forher, she seemed to be wanting to do more; and at length she could notbut own it to be her wish that poor Mrs."
901,1,"Price should be relieved fromthe charge and expense of one child entirely out of her great number.“What if they were among them to undertake the care of her eldestdaughter, a girl now nine years old, of an age to require moreattention than her poor mother could possibly give? The trouble andexpense of it to them would be nothing, compared with the benevolenceof the action.” Lady Bertram agreed with her instantly."
902,1,"“I think wecannot do better,” said she; “let us send for the child.”Sir Thomas could not give so instantaneous and unqualified a consent.He debated and hesitated;—it was a serious charge;—a girl so brought upmust be adequately provided for, or there would be cruelty instead ofkindness in taking her from her family."
903,1,"He thought of his own fourchildren, of his two sons, of cousins in love, etc.;—but no sooner hadhe deliberately begun to state his objections, than Mrs."
904,1,"Norrisinterrupted him with a reply to them all, whether stated or not.“My dear Sir Thomas, I perfectly comprehend you, and do justice to thegenerosity and delicacy of your notions, which indeed are quite of apiece with your general conduct; and I entirely agree with you in themain as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way ofproviding for a child one had in a manner taken into one’s own hands;and I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold mymite upon such an occasion."
905,1,"Having no children of my own, who should Ilook to in any little matter I may ever have to bestow, but thechildren of my sisters?—and I am sure Mr."
906,1,Norris is too just—but youknow I am a woman of few words and professions.
907,1,Do not let us befrightened from a good deed by a trifle.
908,1,"Give a girl an education, andintroduce her properly into the world, and ten to one but she has themeans of settling well, without farther expense to anybody."
909,1,"A niece ofours, Sir Thomas, I may say, or at least of _yours_, would not grow upin this neighbourhood without many advantages."
910,1,I don’t say she would beso handsome as her cousins.
911,1,"I dare say she would not; but she would beintroduced into the society of this country under such very favourablecircumstances as, in all human probability, would get her a creditableestablishment."
912,1,"You are thinking of your sons—but do not you know that,of all things upon earth, _that_ is the least likely to happen, broughtup as they would be, always together like brothers and sisters? It ismorally impossible."
913,1,I never knew an instance of it.
914,1,"It is, in fact, theonly sure way of providing against the connexion."
915,1,"Suppose her a prettygirl, and seen by Tom or Edmund for the first time seven years hence,and I dare say there would be mischief."
916,1,"The very idea of her havingbeen suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty andneglect, would be enough to make either of the dear, sweet-temperedboys in love with her."
917,1,"But breed her up with them from this time, andsuppose her even to have the beauty of an angel, and she will never bemore to either than a sister.”“There is a great deal of truth in what you say,” replied Sir Thomas,“and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of aplan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each.I only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in, andthat to make it really serviceable to Mrs."
918,1,"Price, and creditable toourselves, we must secure to the child, or consider ourselves engagedto secure to her hereafter, as circumstances may arise, the provisionof a gentlewoman, if no such establishment should offer as you are sosanguine in expecting.”“I thoroughly understand you,” cried Mrs."
919,1,"Norris, “you are everythingthat is generous and considerate, and I am sure we shall never disagreeon this point."
920,1,"Whatever I can do, as you well know, I am always readyenough to do for the good of those I love; and, though I could neverfeel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard I bear yourown dear children, nor consider her, in any respect, so much my own, Ishould hate myself if I were capable of neglecting her."
921,1,"Is not she asister’s child? and could I bear to see her want while I had a bit ofbread to give her? My dear Sir Thomas, with all my faults I have a warmheart; and, poor as I am, would rather deny myself the necessaries oflife than do an ungenerous thing."
922,1,"So, if you are not against it, I willwrite to my poor sister tomorrow, and make the proposal; and, as soonas matters are settled, _I_ will engage to get the child to Mansfield;_you_ shall have no trouble about it."
923,1,"My own trouble, you know, I neverregard."
924,1,"I will send Nanny to London on purpose, and she may have a bedat her cousin the saddler’s, and the child be appointed to meet herthere."
925,1,"They may easily get her from Portsmouth to town by the coach,under the care of any creditable person that may chance to be going."
926,1,"Idare say there is always some reputable tradesman’s wife or other goingup.”Except to the attack on Nanny’s cousin, Sir Thomas no longer made anyobjection, and a more respectable, though less economical rendezvousbeing accordingly substituted, everything was considered as settled,and the pleasures of so benevolent a scheme were already enjoyed."
927,1,"Thedivision of gratifying sensations ought not, in strict justice, to havebeen equal; for Sir Thomas was fully resolved to be the real andconsistent patron of the selected child, and Mrs."
928,1,Norris had not theleast intention of being at any expense whatever in her maintenance.
929,1,"Asfar as walking, talking, and contriving reached, she was thoroughlybenevolent, and nobody knew better how to dictate liberality to others;but her love of money was equal to her love of directing, and she knewquite as well how to save her own as to spend that of her friends.Having married on a narrower income than she had been used to lookforward to, she had, from the first, fancied a very strict line ofeconomy necessary; and what was begun as a matter of prudence, soongrew into a matter of choice, as an object of that needful solicitudewhich there were no children to supply."
930,1,"Had there been a family toprovide for, Mrs."
931,1,"Norris might never have saved her money; but havingno care of that kind, there was nothing to impede her frugality, orlessen the comfort of making a yearly addition to an income which theyhad never lived up to."
932,1,"Under this infatuating principle, counteractedby no real affection for her sister, it was impossible for her to aimat more than the credit of projecting and arranging so expensive acharity; though perhaps she might so little know herself as to walkhome to the Parsonage, after this conversation, in the happy belief ofbeing the most liberal-minded sister and aunt in the world.When the subject was brought forward again, her views were more fullyexplained; and, in reply to Lady Bertram’s calm inquiry of “Where shallthe child come to first, sister, to you or to us?” Sir Thomas heardwith some surprise that it would be totally out of Mrs."
933,1,Norris’s powerto take any share in the personal charge of her.
934,1,"He had beenconsidering her as a particularly welcome addition at the Parsonage, asa desirable companion to an aunt who had no children of her own; but hefound himself wholly mistaken."
935,1,Mrs.
936,1,"Norris was sorry to say that thelittle girl’s staying with them, at least as things then were, wasquite out of the question."
937,1,Poor Mr.
938,1,"Norris’s indifferent state ofhealth made it an impossibility: he could no more bear the noise of achild than he could fly; if, indeed, he should ever get well of hisgouty complaints, it would be a different matter: she should then beglad to take her turn, and think nothing of the inconvenience; but justnow, poor Mr."
939,1,"Norris took up every moment of her time, and the verymention of such a thing she was sure would distract him.“Then she had better come to us,” said Lady Bertram, with the utmostcomposure."
940,1,"After a short pause Sir Thomas added with dignity, “Yes, lether home be in this house."
941,1,"We will endeavour to do our duty by her, andshe will, at least, have the advantage of companions of her own age,and of a regular instructress.”“Very true,” cried Mrs."
942,1,"Norris, “which are both very importantconsiderations; and it will be just the same to Miss Lee whether shehas three girls to teach, or only two—there can be no difference."
943,1,Ionly wish I could be more useful; but you see I do all in my power.
944,1,"Iam not one of those that spare their own trouble; and Nanny shall fetchher, however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counselloraway for three days."
945,1,"I suppose, sister, you will put the child in thelittle white attic, near the old nurseries."
946,1,"It will be much the bestplace for her, so near Miss Lee, and not far from the girls, and closeby the housemaids, who could either of them help to dress her, youknow, and take care of her clothes, for I suppose you would not thinkit fair to expect Ellis to wait on her as well as the others."
947,1,"Indeed, Ido not see that you could possibly place her anywhere else.”Lady Bertram made no opposition.“I hope she will prove a well-disposed girl,” continued Mrs."
948,1,"Norris,“and be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends.”“Should her disposition be really bad,” said Sir Thomas, “we must not,for our own children’s sake, continue her in the family; but there isno reason to expect so great an evil."
949,1,"We shall probably see much towish altered in her, and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance,some meanness of opinions, and very distressing vulgarity of manner;but these are not incurable faults; nor, I trust, can they be dangerousfor her associates."
950,1,"Had my daughters been _younger_ than herself, Ishould have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matterof very serious moment; but, as it is, I hope there can be nothing tofear for _them_, and everything to hope for _her_, from theassociation.”“That is exactly what I think,” cried Mrs."
951,1,"Norris, “and what I wassaying to my husband this morning."
952,1,"It will be an education for thechild, said I, only being with her cousins; if Miss Lee taught hernothing, she would learn to be good and clever from _them_.”“I hope she will not tease my poor pug,” said Lady Bertram; “I have butjust got Julia to leave it alone.”“There will be some difficulty in our way, Mrs."
953,1,"Norris,” observed SirThomas, “as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls asthey grow up: how to preserve in the minds of my _daughters_ theconsciousness of what they are, without making them think too lowly oftheir cousin; and how, without depressing her spirits too far, to makeher remember that she is not a _Miss Bertram_."
954,1,"I should wish to seethem very good friends, and would, on no account, authorise in my girlsthe smallest degree of arrogance towards their relation; but still theycannot be equals."
955,1,"Their rank, fortune, rights, and expectations willalways be different."
956,1,"It is a point of great delicacy, and you mustassist us in our endeavours to choose exactly the right line ofconduct.”Mrs."
957,1,"Norris was quite at his service; and though she perfectly agreedwith him as to its being a most difficult thing, encouraged him to hopethat between them it would be easily managed.It will be readily believed that Mrs."
958,1,Norris did not write to hersister in vain.
959,1,Mrs.
960,1,"Price seemed rather surprised that a girl shouldbe fixed on, when she had so many fine boys, but accepted the offermost thankfully, assuring them of her daughter’s being a verywell-disposed, good-humoured girl, and trusting they would never havecause to throw her off."
961,1,"She spoke of her farther as somewhat delicateand puny, but was sanguine in the hope of her being materially betterfor change of air."
962,1,Poor woman! she probably thought change of air mightagree with many of her children.CHAPTER IIThe little girl performed her long journey in safety; and atNorthampton was met by Mrs.
963,1,"Norris, who thus regaled in the credit ofbeing foremost to welcome her, and in the importance of leading her into the others, and recommending her to their kindness.Fanny Price was at this time just ten years old, and though there mightnot be much in her first appearance to captivate, there was, at least,nothing to disgust her relations."
964,1,"She was small of her age, with noglow of complexion, nor any other striking beauty; exceedingly timidand shy, and shrinking from notice; but her air, though awkward, wasnot vulgar, her voice was sweet, and when she spoke her countenance waspretty."
965,1,"Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram received her very kindly; and SirThomas, seeing how much she needed encouragement, tried to be all thatwas conciliating: but he had to work against a most untoward gravity ofdeportment; and Lady Bertram, without taking half so much trouble, orspeaking one word where he spoke ten, by the mere aid of agood-humoured smile, became immediately the less awful character of thetwo.The young people were all at home, and sustained their share in theintroduction very well, with much good humour, and no embarrassment, atleast on the part of the sons, who, at seventeen and sixteen, and tallof their age, had all the grandeur of men in the eyes of their littlecousin."
966,1,"The two girls were more at a loss from being younger and ingreater awe of their father, who addressed them on the occasion withrather an injudicious particularity."
967,1,"But they were too much used tocompany and praise to have anything like natural shyness; and theirconfidence increasing from their cousin’s total want of it, they weresoon able to take a full survey of her face and her frock in easyindifference.They were a remarkably fine family, the sons very well-looking, thedaughters decidedly handsome, and all of them well-grown and forward oftheir age, which produced as striking a difference between the cousinsin person, as education had given to their address; and no one wouldhave supposed the girls so nearly of an age as they really were."
968,1,Therewere in fact but two years between the youngest and Fanny.
969,1,"JuliaBertram was only twelve, and Maria but a year older."
970,1,The little visitormeanwhile was as unhappy as possible.
971,1,"Afraid of everybody, ashamed ofherself, and longing for the home she had left, she knew not how tolook up, and could scarcely speak to be heard, or without crying."
972,1,"Mrs.Norris had been talking to her the whole way from Northampton of herwonderful good fortune, and the extraordinary degree of gratitude andgood behaviour which it ought to produce, and her consciousness ofmisery was therefore increased by the idea of its being a wicked thingfor her not to be happy."
973,1,"The fatigue, too, of so long a journey, becamesoon no trifling evil."
974,1,"In vain were the well-meant condescensions ofSir Thomas, and all the officious prognostications of Mrs."
975,1,"Norris thatshe would be a good girl; in vain did Lady Bertram smile and make hersit on the sofa with herself and pug, and vain was even the sight of agooseberry tart towards giving her comfort; she could scarcely swallowtwo mouthfuls before tears interrupted her, and sleep seeming to be herlikeliest friend, she was taken to finish her sorrows in bed.“This is not a very promising beginning,” said Mrs."
976,1,"Norris, when Fannyhad left the room."
977,1,"“After all that I said to her as we came along, Ithought she would have behaved better; I told her how much might dependupon her acquitting herself well at first."
978,1,"I wish there may not be alittle sulkiness of temper—her poor mother had a good deal; but we mustmake allowances for such a child—and I do not know that her being sorryto leave her home is really against her, for, with all its faults, it_was_ her home, and she cannot as yet understand how much she haschanged for the better; but then there is moderation in all things.”It required a longer time, however, than Mrs."
979,1,"Norris was inclined toallow, to reconcile Fanny to the novelty of Mansfield Park, and theseparation from everybody she had been used to."
980,1,"Her feelings were veryacute, and too little understood to be properly attended to."
981,1,"Nobodymeant to be unkind, but nobody put themselves out of their way tosecure her comfort.The holiday allowed to the Miss Bertrams the next day, on purpose toafford leisure for getting acquainted with, and entertaining theiryoung cousin, produced little union."
982,1,"They could not but hold her cheapon finding that she had but two sashes, and had never learned French;and when they perceived her to be little struck with the duet they wereso good as to play, they could do no more than make her a generouspresent of some of their least valued toys, and leave her to herself,while they adjourned to whatever might be the favourite holiday sportof the moment, making artificial flowers or wasting gold paper.Fanny, whether near or from her cousins, whether in the schoolroom, thedrawing-room, or the shrubbery, was equally forlorn, finding somethingto fear in every person and place."
983,1,"She was disheartened by LadyBertram’s silence, awed by Sir Thomas’s grave looks, and quite overcomeby Mrs."
984,1,Norris’s admonitions.
985,1,"Her elder cousins mortified her byreflections on her size, and abashed her by noticing her shyness: MissLee wondered at her ignorance, and the maid-servants sneered at herclothes; and when to these sorrows was added the idea of the brothersand sisters among whom she had always been important as playfellow,instructress, and nurse, the despondence that sunk her little heart wassevere.The grandeur of the house astonished, but could not console her."
986,1,"Therooms were too large for her to move in with ease: whatever she touchedshe expected to injure, and she crept about in constant terror ofsomething or other; often retreating towards her own chamber to cry;and the little girl who was spoken of in the drawing-room when she leftit at night as seeming so desirably sensible of her peculiar goodfortune, ended every day’s sorrows by sobbing herself to sleep."
987,1,"A weekhad passed in this way, and no suspicion of it conveyed by her quietpassive manner, when she was found one morning by her cousin Edmund,the youngest of the sons, sitting crying on the attic stairs.“My dear little cousin,” said he, with all the gentleness of anexcellent nature, “what can be the matter?” And sitting down by her, hewas at great pains to overcome her shame in being so surprised, andpersuade her to speak openly."
988,1,"Was she ill? or was anybody angry withher? or had she quarrelled with Maria and Julia? or was she puzzledabout anything in her lesson that he could explain? Did she, in short,want anything he could possibly get her, or do for her? For a longwhile no answer could be obtained beyond a “no, no—not at all—no, thankyou”; but he still persevered; and no sooner had he begun to revert toher own home, than her increased sobs explained to him where thegrievance lay."
989,1,"He tried to console her.“You are sorry to leave Mama, my dear little Fanny,” said he, “whichshows you to be a very good girl; but you must remember that you arewith relations and friends, who all love you, and wish to make youhappy."
990,1,"Let us walk out in the park, and you shall tell me all aboutyour brothers and sisters.”On pursuing the subject, he found that, dear as all these brothers andsisters generally were, there was one among them who ran more in herthoughts than the rest."
991,1,"It was William whom she talked of most, andwanted most to see."
992,1,"William, the eldest, a year older than herself, herconstant companion and friend; her advocate with her mother (of whom hewas the darling) in every distress."
993,1,"“William did not like she shouldcome away; he had told her he should miss her very much indeed.” “ButWilliam will write to you, I dare say.” “Yes, he had promised he would,but he had told _her_ to write first.” “And when shall you do it?” Shehung her head and answered hesitatingly, “she did not know; she had notany paper.”“If that be all your difficulty, I will furnish you with paper andevery other material, and you may write your letter whenever youchoose."
994,1,"Would it make you happy to write to William?”“Yes, very.”“Then let it be done now."
995,1,"Come with me into the breakfast-room, weshall find everything there, and be sure of having the room toourselves.”“But, cousin, will it go to the post?”“Yes, depend upon me it shall: it shall go with the other letters; and,as your uncle will frank it, it will cost William nothing.”“My uncle!” repeated Fanny, with a frightened look.“Yes, when you have written the letter, I will take it to my father tofrank.”Fanny thought it a bold measure, but offered no further resistance; andthey went together into the breakfast-room, where Edmund prepared herpaper, and ruled her lines with all the goodwill that her brother couldhimself have felt, and probably with somewhat more exactness."
996,1,"Hecontinued with her the whole time of her writing, to assist her withhis penknife or his orthography, as either were wanted; and added tothese attentions, which she felt very much, a kindness to her brotherwhich delighted her beyond all the rest."
997,1,"He wrote with his own hand hislove to his cousin William, and sent him half a guinea under the seal.Fanny’s feelings on the occasion were such as she believed herselfincapable of expressing; but her countenance and a few artless wordsfully conveyed all their gratitude and delight, and her cousin began tofind her an interesting object."
998,1,"He talked to her more, and, from allthat she said, was convinced of her having an affectionate heart, and astrong desire of doing right; and he could perceive her to be fartherentitled to attention by great sensibility of her situation, and greattimidity."
999,1,"He had never knowingly given her pain, but he now felt thatshe required more positive kindness; and with that view endeavoured, inthe first place, to lessen her fears of them all, and gave herespecially a great deal of good advice as to playing with Maria andJulia, and being as merry as possible.From this day Fanny grew more comfortable."
1000,1,"She felt that she had afriend, and the kindness of her cousin Edmund gave her better spiritswith everybody else."
1001,1,"The place became less strange, and the people lessformidable; and if there were some amongst them whom she could notcease to fear, she began at least to know their ways, and to catch thebest manner of conforming to them."
1002,1,"The little rusticities andawkwardnesses which had at first made grievous inroads on thetranquillity of all, and not least of herself, necessarily wore away,and she was no longer materially afraid to appear before her uncle, nordid her aunt Norris’s voice make her start very much."
1003,1,To her cousinsshe became occasionally an acceptable companion.
1004,1,"Though unworthy, frominferiority of age and strength, to be their constant associate, theirpleasures and schemes were sometimes of a nature to make a third veryuseful, especially when that third was of an obliging, yielding temper;and they could not but own, when their aunt inquired into her faults,or their brother Edmund urged her claims to their kindness, that “Fannywas good-natured enough.”Edmund was uniformly kind himself; and she had nothing worse to endureon the part of Tom than that sort of merriment which a young man ofseventeen will always think fair with a child of ten."
1005,1,"He was justentering into life, full of spirits, and with all the liberaldispositions of an eldest son, who feels born only for expense andenjoyment."
1006,1,"His kindness to his little cousin was consistent with hissituation and rights: he made her some very pretty presents, andlaughed at her.As her appearance and spirits improved, Sir Thomas and Mrs."
1007,1,"Norristhought with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan; and it waspretty soon decided between them that, though far from clever, sheshowed a tractable disposition, and seemed likely to give them littletrouble."
1008,1,"A mean opinion of her abilities was not confined to _them_.Fanny could read, work, and write, but she had been taught nothingmore; and as her cousins found her ignorant of many things with whichthey had been long familiar, they thought her prodigiously stupid, andfor the first two or three weeks were continually bringing some freshreport of it into the drawing-room."
1009,1,"“Dear mama, only think, my cousincannot put the map of Europe together—or my cousin cannot tell theprincipal rivers in Russia—or, she never heard of Asia Minor—or shedoes not know the difference between water-colours and crayons!—Howstrange!—Did you ever hear anything so stupid?”“My dear,” their considerate aunt would reply, “it is very bad, but youmust not expect everybody to be as forward and quick at learning asyourself.”“But, aunt, she is really so very ignorant!—Do you know, we asked herlast night which way she would go to get to Ireland; and she said, sheshould cross to the Isle of Wight."
1010,1,"She thinks of nothing but the Isleof Wight, and she calls it _the_ _Island_, as if there were no otherisland in the world."
1011,1,"I am sure I should have been ashamed of myself, ifI had not known better long before I was so old as she is."
1012,1,I cannotremember the time when I did not know a great deal that she has not theleast notion of yet.
1013,1,"How long ago it is, aunt, since we used to repeatthe chronological order of the kings of England, with the dates oftheir accession, and most of the principal events of their reigns!”“Yes,” added the other; “and of the Roman emperors as low as Severus;besides a great deal of the heathen mythology, and all the metals,semi-metals, planets, and distinguished philosophers.”“Very true indeed, my dears, but you are blessed with wonderfulmemories, and your poor cousin has probably none at all."
1014,1,"There is avast deal of difference in memories, as well as in everything else, andtherefore you must make allowance for your cousin, and pity herdeficiency."
1015,1,"And remember that, if you are ever so forward and cleveryourselves, you should always be modest; for, much as you know already,there is a great deal more for you to learn.”“Yes, I know there is, till I am seventeen."
1016,1,"But I must tell you anotherthing of Fanny, so odd and so stupid."
1017,1,"Do you know, she says she doesnot want to learn either music or drawing.”“To be sure, my dear, that is very stupid indeed, and shows a greatwant of genius and emulation."
1018,1,"But, all things considered, I do not knowwhether it is not as well that it should be so, for, though you know(owing to me) your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up withyou, it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished asyou are;—on the contrary, it is much more desirable that there shouldbe a difference.”Such were the counsels by which Mrs."
1019,1,"Norris assisted to form hernieces’ minds; and it is not very wonderful that, with all theirpromising talents and early information, they should be entirelydeficient in the less common acquirements of self-knowledge, generosityand humility."
1020,1,"In everything but disposition they were admirably taught.Sir Thomas did not know what was wanting, because, though a trulyanxious father, he was not outwardly affectionate, and the reserve ofhis manner repressed all the flow of their spirits before him.To the education of her daughters Lady Bertram paid not the smallestattention."
1021,1,She had not time for such cares.
1022,1,"She was a woman who spenther days in sitting, nicely dressed, on a sofa, doing some long pieceof needlework, of little use and no beauty, thinking more of her pugthan her children, but very indulgent to the latter when it did not putherself to inconvenience, guided in everything important by Sir Thomas,and in smaller concerns by her sister."
1023,1,"Had she possessed greaterleisure for the service of her girls, she would probably have supposedit unnecessary, for they were under the care of a governess, withproper masters, and could want nothing more."
1024,1,"As for Fanny’s beingstupid at learning, “she could only say it was very unlucky, but somepeople _were_ stupid, and Fanny must take more pains: she did not knowwhat else was to be done; and, except her being so dull, she must addshe saw no harm in the poor little thing, and always found her veryhandy and quick in carrying messages, and fetching what she wanted.”Fanny, with all her faults of ignorance and timidity, was fixed atMansfield Park, and learning to transfer in its favour much of herattachment to her former home, grew up there not unhappily among hercousins."
1025,1,"There was no positive ill-nature in Maria or Julia; and thoughFanny was often mortified by their treatment of her, she thought toolowly of her own claims to feel injured by it.From about the time of her entering the family, Lady Bertram, inconsequence of a little ill-health, and a great deal of indolence, gaveup the house in town, which she had been used to occupy every spring,and remained wholly in the country, leaving Sir Thomas to attend hisduty in Parliament, with whatever increase or diminution of comfortmight arise from her absence."
1026,1,"In the country, therefore, the MissBertrams continued to exercise their memories, practise their duets,and grow tall and womanly: and their father saw them becoming inperson, manner, and accomplishments, everything that could satisfy hisanxiety."
1027,1,"His eldest son was careless and extravagant, and had alreadygiven him much uneasiness; but his other children promised him nothingbut good."
1028,1,"His daughters, he felt, while they retained the name ofBertram, must be giving it new grace, and in quitting it, he trusted,would extend its respectable alliances; and the character of Edmund,his strong good sense and uprightness of mind, bid most fairly forutility, honour, and happiness to himself and all his connexions."
1029,1,"Hewas to be a clergyman.Amid the cares and the complacency which his own children suggested,Sir Thomas did not forget to do what he could for the children of Mrs.Price: he assisted her liberally in the education and disposal of hersons as they became old enough for a determinate pursuit; and Fanny,though almost totally separated from her family, was sensible of thetruest satisfaction in hearing of any kindness towards them, or ofanything at all promising in their situation or conduct."
1030,1,"Once, and onceonly, in the course of many years, had she the happiness of being withWilliam."
1031,1,"Of the rest she saw nothing: nobody seemed to think of herever going amongst them again, even for a visit, nobody at home seemedto want her; but William determining, soon after her removal, to be asailor, was invited to spend a week with his sister in Northamptonshirebefore he went to sea."
1032,1,"Their eager affection in meeting, theirexquisite delight in being together, their hours of happy mirth, andmoments of serious conference, may be imagined; as well as the sanguineviews and spirits of the boy even to the last, and the misery of thegirl when he left her."
1033,1,"Luckily the visit happened in the Christmasholidays, when she could directly look for comfort to her cousinEdmund; and he told her such charming things of what William was to do,and be hereafter, in consequence of his profession, as made hergradually admit that the separation might have some use."
1034,1,"Edmund’sfriendship never failed her: his leaving Eton for Oxford made no changein his kind dispositions, and only afforded more frequent opportunitiesof proving them."
1035,1,"Without any display of doing more than the rest, orany fear of doing too much, he was always true to her interests, andconsiderate of her feelings, trying to make her good qualitiesunderstood, and to conquer the diffidence which prevented their beingmore apparent; giving her advice, consolation, and encouragement.Kept back as she was by everybody else, his single support could notbring her forward; but his attentions were otherwise of the highestimportance in assisting the improvement of her mind, and extending itspleasures."
1036,1,"He knew her to be clever, to have a quick apprehension aswell as good sense, and a fondness for reading, which, properlydirected, must be an education in itself."
1037,1,"Miss Lee taught her French,and heard her read the daily portion of history; but he recommended thebooks which charmed her leisure hours, he encouraged her taste, andcorrected her judgment: he made reading useful by talking to her ofwhat she read, and heightened its attraction by judicious praise."
1038,1,"Inreturn for such services she loved him better than anybody in the worldexcept William: her heart was divided between the two.CHAPTER IIIThe first event of any importance in the family was the death of Mr.Norris, which happened when Fanny was about fifteen, and necessarilyintroduced alterations and novelties."
1039,1,Mrs.
1040,1,"Norris, on quitting theParsonage, removed first to the Park, and afterwards to a small houseof Sir Thomas’s in the village, and consoled herself for the loss ofher husband by considering that she could do very well without him; andfor her reduction of income by the evident necessity of strictereconomy.The living was hereafter for Edmund; and, had his uncle died a fewyears sooner, it would have been duly given to some friend to hold tillhe were old enough for orders."
1041,1,"But Tom’s extravagance had, previous tothat event, been so great as to render a different disposal of the nextpresentation necessary, and the younger brother must help to pay forthe pleasures of the elder."
1042,1,"There was another family living actuallyheld for Edmund; but though this circumstance had made the arrangementsomewhat easier to Sir Thomas’s conscience, he could not but feel it tobe an act of injustice, and he earnestly tried to impress his eldestson with the same conviction, in the hope of its producing a bettereffect than anything he had yet been able to say or do.“I blush for you, Tom,” said he, in his most dignified manner; “I blushfor the expedient which I am driven on, and I trust I may pity yourfeelings as a brother on the occasion."
1043,1,"You have robbed Edmund for ten,twenty, thirty years, perhaps for life, of more than half the incomewhich ought to be his."
1044,1,"It may hereafter be in my power, or in yours (Ihope it will), to procure him better preferment; but it must not beforgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond hisnatural claims on us, and that nothing can, in fact, be an equivalentfor the certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego through theurgency of your debts.”Tom listened with some shame and some sorrow; but escaping as quicklyas possible, could soon with cheerful selfishness reflect, firstly,that he had not been half so much in debt as some of his friends;secondly, that his father had made a most tiresome piece of work of it;and, thirdly, that the future incumbent, whoever he might be, would, inall probability, die very soon.On Mr."
1045,1,Norris’s death the presentation became the right of a Dr.
1046,1,"Grant,who came consequently to reside at Mansfield; and on proving to be ahearty man of forty-five, seemed likely to disappoint Mr."
1047,1,Bertram’scalculations.
1048,1,"But “no, he was a short-necked, apoplectic sort offellow, and, plied well with good things, would soon pop off.”He had a wife about fifteen years his junior, but no children; and theyentered the neighbourhood with the usual fair report of being veryrespectable, agreeable people.The time was now come when Sir Thomas expected his sister-in-law toclaim her share in their niece, the change in Mrs."
1049,1,"Norris’s situation,and the improvement in Fanny’s age, seeming not merely to do away anyformer objection to their living together, but even to give it the mostdecided eligibility; and as his own circumstances were rendered lessfair than heretofore, by some recent losses on his West India estate,in addition to his eldest son’s extravagance, it became not undesirableto himself to be relieved from the expense of her support, and theobligation of her future provision."
1050,1,"In the fullness of his belief thatsuch a thing must be, he mentioned its probability to his wife; and thefirst time of the subject’s occurring to her again happening to be whenFanny was present, she calmly observed to her, “So, Fanny, you aregoing to leave us, and live with my sister."
1051,1,"How shall you like it?”Fanny was too much surprised to do more than repeat her aunt’s words,“Going to leave you?”“Yes, my dear; why should you be astonished? You have been five yearswith us, and my sister always meant to take you when Mr."
1052,1,Norris died.But you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same.”The news was as disagreeable to Fanny as it had been unexpected.
1053,1,"Shehad never received kindness from her aunt Norris, and could not loveher.“I shall be very sorry to go away,” said she, with a faltering voice.“Yes, I dare say you will; _that’s_ natural enough."
1054,1,"I suppose you havehad as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creaturein the world.”“I hope I am not ungrateful, aunt,” said Fanny modestly.“No, my dear; I hope not."
1055,1,"I have always found you a very good girl.”“And am I never to live here again?”“Never, my dear; but you are sure of a comfortable home."
1056,1,"It can makevery little difference to you, whether you are in one house or theother.”Fanny left the room with a very sorrowful heart; she could not feel thedifference to be so small, she could not think of living with her auntwith anything like satisfaction."
1057,1,"As soon as she met with Edmund shetold him her distress.“Cousin,” said she, “something is going to happen which I do not likeat all; and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled tothings that I disliked at first, you will not be able to do it now."
1058,1,Iam going to live entirely with my aunt Norris.”“Indeed!”“Yes; my aunt Bertram has just told me so.
1059,1,It is quite settled.
1060,1,"I am toleave Mansfield Park, and go to the White House, I suppose, as soon asshe is removed there.”“Well, Fanny, and if the plan were not unpleasant to you, I should callit an excellent one.”“Oh, cousin!”“It has everything else in its favour."
1061,1,My aunt is acting like asensible woman in wishing for you.
1062,1,"She is choosing a friend andcompanion exactly where she ought, and I am glad her love of money doesnot interfere."
1063,1,You will be what you ought to be to her.
1064,1,"I hope it doesnot distress you very much, Fanny?”“Indeed it does: I cannot like it."
1065,1,I love this house and everything init: I shall love nothing there.
1066,1,"You know how uncomfortable I feel withher.”“I can say nothing for her manner to you as a child; but it was thesame with us all, or nearly so."
1067,1,She never knew how to be pleasant tochildren.
1068,1,"But you are now of an age to be treated better; I think sheis behaving better already; and when you are her only companion, you_must_ be important to her.”“I can never be important to any one.”“What is to prevent you?”“Everything."
1069,1,"My situation, my foolishness and awkwardness.”“As to your foolishness and awkwardness, my dear Fanny, believe me, younever have a shadow of either, but in using the words so improperly.There is no reason in the world why you should not be important whereyou are known."
1070,1,"You have good sense, and a sweet temper, and I am sureyou have a grateful heart, that could never receive kindness withoutwishing to return it."
1071,1,"I do not know any better qualifications for afriend and companion.”“You are too kind,” said Fanny, colouring at such praise; “how shall Iever thank you as I ought, for thinking so well of me."
1072,1,"Oh! cousin, if Iam to go away, I shall remember your goodness to the last moment of mylife.”“Why, indeed, Fanny, I should hope to be remembered at such a distanceas the White House."
1073,1,You speak as if you were going two hundred milesoff instead of only across the park; but you will belong to us almostas much as ever.
1074,1,The two families will be meeting every day in theyear.
1075,1,"The only difference will be that, living with your aunt, you willnecessarily be brought forward as you ought to be."
1076,1,"_Here_ there are toomany whom you can hide behind; but with _her_ you will be forced tospeak for yourself.”“Oh! do not say so.”“I must say it, and say it with pleasure."
1077,1,Mrs.
1078,1,Norris is much betterfitted than my mother for having the charge of you now.
1079,1,"She is of atemper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herselfabout, and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers.”Fanny sighed, and said, “I cannot see things as you do; but I ought tobelieve you to be right rather than myself, and I am very much obligedto you for trying to reconcile me to what must be."
1080,1,"If I could supposemy aunt really to care for me, it would be delightful to feel myself ofconsequence to anybody."
1081,1,"_Here_, I know, I am of none, and yet I lovethe place so well.”“The place, Fanny, is what you will not quit, though you quit thehouse."
1082,1,You will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever.Even _your_ constant little heart need not take fright at such anominal change.
1083,1,"You will have the same walks to frequent, the samelibrary to choose from, the same people to look at, the same horse toride.”“Very true."
1084,1,"Yes, dear old grey pony! Ah! cousin, when I remember howmuch I used to dread riding, what terrors it gave me to hear it talkedof as likely to do me good (oh! how I have trembled at my uncle’sopening his lips if horses were talked of), and then think of the kindpains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears, and convinceme that I should like it after a little while, and feel how right youproved to be, I am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well.”“And I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs."
1085,1,"Norris will be asgood for your mind as riding has been for your health, and as much foryour ultimate happiness too.”So ended their discourse, which, for any very appropriate service itcould render Fanny, might as well have been spared, for Mrs."
1086,1,Norris hadnot the smallest intention of taking her.
1087,1,"It had never occurred to her,on the present occasion, but as a thing to be carefully avoided."
1088,1,"Toprevent its being expected, she had fixed on the smallest habitationwhich could rank as genteel among the buildings of Mansfield parish,the White House being only just large enough to receive herself and herservants, and allow a spare room for a friend, of which she made a veryparticular point."
1089,1,"The spare rooms at the Parsonage had never beenwanted, but the absolute necessity of a spare room for a friend was nownever forgotten."
1090,1,"Not all her precautions, however, could save her frombeing suspected of something better; or, perhaps, her very display ofthe importance of a spare room might have misled Sir Thomas to supposeit really intended for Fanny."
1091,1,Lady Bertram soon brought the matter to acertainty by carelessly observing to Mrs.
1092,1,"Norris—“I think, sister, we need not keep Miss Lee any longer, when Fanny goesto live with you.”Mrs."
1093,1,Norris almost started.
1094,1,"“Live with me, dear Lady Bertram! what doyou mean?”“Is she not to live with you? I thought you had settled it with SirThomas.”“Me! never."
1095,1,"I never spoke a syllable about it to Sir Thomas, nor he tome."
1096,1,"Fanny live with me! the last thing in the world for me to think of,or for anybody to wish that really knows us both."
1097,1,"Good heaven! whatcould I do with Fanny? Me! a poor, helpless, forlorn widow, unfit foranything, my spirits quite broke down; what could I do with a girl ather time of life? A girl of fifteen! the very age of all others to needmost attention and care, and put the cheerfullest spirits to the test!Sure Sir Thomas could not seriously expect such a thing! Sir Thomas istoo much my friend."
1098,1,"Nobody that wishes me well, I am sure, wouldpropose it."
1099,1,"How came Sir Thomas to speak to you about it?”“Indeed, I do not know."
1100,1,I suppose he thought it best.”“But what did he say? He could not say he _wished_ me to take Fanny.
1101,1,Iam sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it.”“No; he only said he thought it very likely; and I thought so too.
1102,1,Weboth thought it would be a comfort to you.
1103,1,"But if you do not like it,there is no more to be said."
1104,1,"She is no encumbrance here.”“Dear sister, if you consider my unhappy state, how can she be anycomfort to me? Here am I, a poor desolate widow, deprived of the bestof husbands, my health gone in attending and nursing him, my spiritsstill worse, all my peace in this world destroyed, with hardly enoughto support me in the rank of a gentlewoman, and enable me to live so asnot to disgrace the memory of the dear departed—what possible comfortcould I have in taking such a charge upon me as Fanny? If I could wishit for my own sake, I would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl.She is in good hands, and sure of doing well."
1105,1,"I must struggle throughmy sorrows and difficulties as I can.”“Then you will not mind living by yourself quite alone?”“Lady Bertram, I do not complain."
1106,1,"I know I cannot live as I have done,but I must retrench where I can, and learn to be a better manager."
1107,1,"I_have_ _been_ a liberal housekeeper enough, but I shall not be ashamedto practise economy now."
1108,1,My situation is as much altered as my income.A great many things were due from poor Mr.
1109,1,"Norris, as clergyman of theparish, that cannot be expected from me."
1110,1,It is unknown how much wasconsumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers.
1111,1,"At the White House,matters must be better looked after."
1112,1,"I _must_ live within my income, orI shall be miserable; and I own it would give me great satisfaction tobe able to do rather more, to lay by a little at the end of the year.”“I dare say you will."
1113,1,"You always do, don’t you?”“My object, Lady Bertram, is to be of use to those that come after me.It is for your children’s good that I wish to be richer."
1114,1,"I have nobodyelse to care for, but I should be very glad to think I could leave alittle trifle among them worth their having.”“You are very good, but do not trouble yourself about them."
1115,1,They aresure of being well provided for.
1116,1,"Sir Thomas will take care of that.”“Why, you know, Sir Thomas’s means will be rather straitened if theAntigua estate is to make such poor returns.”“Oh! _that_ will soon be settled."
1117,1,"Sir Thomas has been writing about it,I know.”“Well, Lady Bertram,” said Mrs."
1118,1,"Norris, moving to go, “I can only saythat my sole desire is to be of use to your family: and so, if SirThomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny, you will be ableto say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question;besides that, I really should not have a bed to give her, for I mustkeep a spare room for a friend.”Lady Bertram repeated enough of this conversation to her husband toconvince him how much he had mistaken his sister-in-law’s views; andshe was from that moment perfectly safe from all expectation, or theslightest allusion to it from him."
1119,1,"He could not but wonder at herrefusing to do anything for a niece whom she had been so forward toadopt; but, as she took early care to make him, as well as LadyBertram, understand that whatever she possessed was designed for theirfamily, he soon grew reconciled to a distinction which, at the sametime that it was advantageous and complimentary to them, would enablehim better to provide for Fanny himself.Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal; andher spontaneous, untaught felicity on the discovery, conveyed someconsolation to Edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected tobe so essentially serviceable to her."
1120,1,Mrs.
1121,1,"Norris took possession ofthe White House, the Grants arrived at the Parsonage, and these eventsover, everything at Mansfield went on for some time as usual.The Grants showing a disposition to be friendly and sociable, gavegreat satisfaction in the main among their new acquaintance."
1122,1,"They hadtheir faults, and Mrs."
1123,1,Norris soon found them out.
1124,1,"The Doctor was veryfond of eating, and would have a good dinner every day; and Mrs."
1125,1,"Grant,instead of contriving to gratify him at little expense, gave her cookas high wages as they did at Mansfield Park, and was scarcely ever seenin her offices."
1126,1,Mrs.
1127,1,"Norris could not speak with any temper of suchgrievances, nor of the quantity of butter and eggs that were regularlyconsumed in the house."
1128,1,"“Nobody loved plenty and hospitality more thanherself; nobody more hated pitiful doings; the Parsonage, she believed,had never been wanting in comforts of any sort, had never borne a badcharacter in _her_ _time_, but this was a way of going on that shecould not understand."
1129,1,A fine lady in a country parsonage was quite outof place.
1130,1,"_Her_ store-room, she thought, might have been good enoughfor Mrs."
1131,1,Grant to go into.
1132,1,"Inquire where she would, she could not findout that Mrs."
1133,1,"Grant had ever had more than five thousand pounds.”Lady Bertram listened without much interest to this sort of invective.She could not enter into the wrongs of an economist, but she felt allthe injuries of beauty in Mrs."
1134,1,"Grant’s being so well settled in lifewithout being handsome, and expressed her astonishment on that pointalmost as often, though not so diffusely, as Mrs."
1135,1,"Norris discussed theother.These opinions had been hardly canvassed a year before another eventarose of such importance in the family, as might fairly claim someplace in the thoughts and conversation of the ladies."
1136,1,"Sir Thomas foundit expedient to go to Antigua himself, for the better arrangement ofhis affairs, and he took his eldest son with him, in the hope ofdetaching him from some bad connexions at home."
1137,1,"They left England withthe probability of being nearly a twelvemonth absent.The necessity of the measure in a pecuniary light, and the hope of itsutility to his son, reconciled Sir Thomas to the effort of quitting therest of his family, and of leaving his daughters to the direction ofothers at their present most interesting time of life."
1138,1,"He could notthink Lady Bertram quite equal to supply his place with them, orrather, to perform what should have been her own; but, in Mrs."
1139,1,"Norris’swatchful attention, and in Edmund’s judgment, he had sufficientconfidence to make him go without fears for their conduct.Lady Bertram did not at all like to have her husband leave her; but shewas not disturbed by any alarm for his safety, or solicitude for hiscomfort, being one of those persons who think nothing can be dangerous,or difficult, or fatiguing to anybody but themselves.The Miss Bertrams were much to be pitied on the occasion: not for theirsorrow, but for their want of it."
1140,1,"Their father was no object of love tothem; he had never seemed the friend of their pleasures, and hisabsence was unhappily most welcome."
1141,1,"They were relieved by it from allrestraint; and without aiming at one gratification that would probablyhave been forbidden by Sir Thomas, they felt themselves immediately attheir own disposal, and to have every indulgence within their reach.Fanny’s relief, and her consciousness of it, were quite equal to hercousins’; but a more tender nature suggested that her feelings wereungrateful, and she really grieved because she could not grieve."
1142,1,"“SirThomas, who had done so much for her and her brothers, and who was goneperhaps never to return! that she should see him go without a tear! itwas a shameful insensibility.” He had said to her, moreover, on thevery last morning, that he hoped she might see William again in thecourse of the ensuing winter, and had charged her to write and invitehim to Mansfield as soon as the squadron to which he belonged should beknown to be in England."
1143,1,"“This was so thoughtful and kind!” and would heonly have smiled upon her, and called her “my dear Fanny,” while hesaid it, every former frown or cold address might have been forgotten.But he had ended his speech in a way to sink her in sad mortification,by adding, “If William does come to Mansfield, I hope you may be ableto convince him that the many years which have passed since you partedhave not been spent on your side entirely without improvement; though,I fear, he must find his sister at sixteen in some respects too muchlike his sister at ten.” She cried bitterly over this reflection whenher uncle was gone; and her cousins, on seeing her with red eyes, sether down as a hypocrite.CHAPTER IVTom Bertram had of late spent so little of his time at home that hecould be only nominally missed; and Lady Bertram was soon astonished tofind how very well they did even without his father, how well Edmundcould supply his place in carving, talking to the steward, writing tothe attorney, settling with the servants, and equally saving her fromall possible fatigue or exertion in every particular but that ofdirecting her letters.The earliest intelligence of the travellers’ safe arrival at Antigua,after a favourable voyage, was received; though not before Mrs."
1144,1,"Norrishad been indulging in very dreadful fears, and trying to make Edmundparticipate them whenever she could get him alone; and as she dependedon being the first person made acquainted with any fatal catastrophe,she had already arranged the manner of breaking it to all the others,when Sir Thomas’s assurances of their both being alive and well made itnecessary to lay by her agitation and affectionate preparatory speechesfor a while.The winter came and passed without their being called for; the accountscontinued perfectly good; and Mrs."
1145,1,"Norris, in promoting gaieties forher nieces, assisting their toilets, displaying their accomplishments,and looking about for their future husbands, had so much to do as, inaddition to all her own household cares, some interference in those ofher sister, and Mrs."
1146,1,"Grant’s wasteful doings to overlook, left her verylittle occasion to be occupied in fears for the absent.The Miss Bertrams were now fully established among the belles of theneighbourhood; and as they joined to beauty and brilliant acquirementsa manner naturally easy, and carefully formed to general civility andobligingness, they possessed its favour as well as its admiration.Their vanity was in such good order that they seemed to be quite freefrom it, and gave themselves no airs; while the praises attending suchbehaviour, secured and brought round by their aunt, served tostrengthen them in believing they had no faults.Lady Bertram did not go into public with her daughters."
1147,1,"She was tooindolent even to accept a mother’s gratification in witnessing theirsuccess and enjoyment at the expense of any personal trouble, and thecharge was made over to her sister, who desired nothing better than apost of such honourable representation, and very thoroughly relishedthe means it afforded her of mixing in society without having horses tohire.Fanny had no share in the festivities of the season; but she enjoyedbeing avowedly useful as her aunt’s companion when they called away therest of the family; and, as Miss Lee had left Mansfield, she naturallybecame everything to Lady Bertram during the night of a ball or aparty."
1148,1,"She talked to her, listened to her, read to her; and thetranquillity of such evenings, her perfect security in such a_tête-à-tête_ from any sound of unkindness, was unspeakably welcome toa mind which had seldom known a pause in its alarms or embarrassments.As to her cousins’ gaieties, she loved to hear an account of them,especially of the balls, and whom Edmund had danced with; but thoughttoo lowly of her own situation to imagine she should ever be admittedto the same, and listened, therefore, without an idea of any nearerconcern in them."
1149,1,"Upon the whole, it was a comfortable winter to her;for though it brought no William to England, the never-failing hope ofhis arrival was worth much.The ensuing spring deprived her of her valued friend, the old greypony; and for some time she was in danger of feeling the loss in herhealth as well as in her affections; for in spite of the acknowledgedimportance of her riding on horse-back, no measures were taken formounting her again, “because,” as it was observed by her aunts, “shemight ride one of her cousin’s horses at any time when they did notwant them,” and as the Miss Bertrams regularly wanted their horsesevery fine day, and had no idea of carrying their obliging manners tothe sacrifice of any real pleasure, that time, of course, never came.They took their cheerful rides in the fine mornings of April and May;and Fanny either sat at home the whole day with one aunt, or walkedbeyond her strength at the instigation of the other: Lady Bertramholding exercise to be as unnecessary for everybody as it wasunpleasant to herself; and Mrs."
1150,1,"Norris, who was walking all day,thinking everybody ought to walk as much."
1151,1,"Edmund was absent at thistime, or the evil would have been earlier remedied."
1152,1,"When he returned,to understand how Fanny was situated, and perceived its ill effects,there seemed with him but one thing to be done; and that “Fanny musthave a horse” was the resolute declaration with which he opposedwhatever could be urged by the supineness of his mother, or the economyof his aunt, to make it appear unimportant."
1153,1,Mrs.
1154,1,Norris could not helpthinking that some steady old thing might be found among the numbersbelonging to the Park that would do vastly well; or that one might beborrowed of the steward; or that perhaps Dr.
1155,1,Grant might now and thenlend them the pony he sent to the post.
1156,1,"She could not but consider itas absolutely unnecessary, and even improper, that Fanny should have aregular lady’s horse of her own, in the style of her cousins."
1157,1,"She wassure Sir Thomas had never intended it: and she must say that, to bemaking such a purchase in his absence, and adding to the great expensesof his stable, at a time when a large part of his income was unsettled,seemed to her very unjustifiable."
1158,1,"“Fanny must have a horse,” wasEdmund’s only reply."
1159,1,Mrs.
1160,1,"Norris could not see it in the same light.Lady Bertram did: she entirely agreed with her son as to the necessityof it, and as to its being considered necessary by his father; she onlypleaded against there being any hurry; she only wanted him to wait tillSir Thomas’s return, and then Sir Thomas might settle it all himself.He would be at home in September, and where would be the harm of onlywaiting till September?Though Edmund was much more displeased with his aunt than with hismother, as evincing least regard for her niece, he could not helppaying more attention to what she said; and at length determined on amethod of proceeding which would obviate the risk of his father’sthinking he had done too much, and at the same time procure for Fannythe immediate means of exercise, which he could not bear she should bewithout."
1161,1,"He had three horses of his own, but not one that would carry awoman."
1162,1,"Two of them were hunters; the third, a useful road-horse: thisthird he resolved to exchange for one that his cousin might ride; heknew where such a one was to be met with; and having once made up hismind, the whole business was soon completed."
1163,1,"The new mare proved atreasure; with a very little trouble she became exactly calculated forthe purpose, and Fanny was then put in almost full possession of her.She had not supposed before that anything could ever suit her like theold grey pony; but her delight in Edmund’s mare was far beyond anyformer pleasure of the sort; and the addition it was ever receiving inthe consideration of that kindness from which her pleasure sprung, wasbeyond all her words to express."
1164,1,"She regarded her cousin as an exampleof everything good and great, as possessing worth which no one butherself could ever appreciate, and as entitled to such gratitude fromher as no feelings could be strong enough to pay."
1165,1,"Her sentimentstowards him were compounded of all that was respectful, grateful,confiding, and tender.As the horse continued in name, as well as fact, the property ofEdmund, Mrs."
1166,1,"Norris could tolerate its being for Fanny’s use; and hadLady Bertram ever thought about her own objection again, he might havebeen excused in her eyes for not waiting till Sir Thomas’s return inSeptember, for when September came Sir Thomas was still abroad, andwithout any near prospect of finishing his business."
1167,1,"Unfavourablecircumstances had suddenly arisen at a moment when he was beginning toturn all his thoughts towards England; and the very great uncertaintyin which everything was then involved determined him on sending homehis son, and waiting the final arrangement by himself."
1168,1,"Tom arrivedsafely, bringing an excellent account of his father’s health; but tovery little purpose, as far as Mrs."
1169,1,Norris was concerned.
1170,1,"Sir Thomas’ssending away his son seemed to her so like a parent’s care, under theinfluence of a foreboding of evil to himself, that she could not helpfeeling dreadful presentiments; and as the long evenings of autumn cameon, was so terribly haunted by these ideas, in the sad solitariness ofher cottage, as to be obliged to take daily refuge in the dining-roomof the Park."
1171,1,"The return of winter engagements, however, was not withoutits effect; and in the course of their progress, her mind became sopleasantly occupied in superintending the fortunes of her eldest niece,as tolerably to quiet her nerves."
1172,1,"“If poor Sir Thomas were fated neverto return, it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Mariawell married,” she very often thought; always when they were in thecompany of men of fortune, and particularly on the introduction of ayoung man who had recently succeeded to one of the largest estates andfinest places in the country.Mr."
1173,1,"Rushworth was from the first struck with the beauty of MissBertram, and, being inclined to marry, soon fancied himself in love."
1174,1,"Hewas a heavy young man, with not more than common sense; but as therewas nothing disagreeable in his figure or address, the young lady waswell pleased with her conquest."
1175,1,"Being now in her twenty-first year,Maria Bertram was beginning to think matrimony a duty; and as amarriage with Mr."
1176,1,"Rushworth would give her the enjoyment of a largerincome than her father’s, as well as ensure her the house in town,which was now a prime object, it became, by the same rule of moralobligation, her evident duty to marry Mr."
1177,1,Rushworth if she could.
1178,1,"Mrs.Norris was most zealous in promoting the match, by every suggestion andcontrivance likely to enhance its desirableness to either party; and,among other means, by seeking an intimacy with the gentleman’s mother,who at present lived with him, and to whom she even forced Lady Bertramto go through ten miles of indifferent road to pay a morning visit."
1179,1,Itwas not long before a good understanding took place between this ladyand herself.
1180,1,Mrs.
1181,1,"Rushworth acknowledged herself very desirous that herson should marry, and declared that of all the young ladies she hadever seen, Miss Bertram seemed, by her amiable qualities andaccomplishments, the best adapted to make him happy."
1182,1,Mrs.
1183,1,"Norrisaccepted the compliment, and admired the nice discernment of characterwhich could so well distinguish merit."
1184,1,"Maria was indeed the pride anddelight of them all—perfectly faultless—an angel; and, of course, sosurrounded by admirers, must be difficult in her choice: but yet, asfar as Mrs."
1185,1,"Norris could allow herself to decide on so short anacquaintance, Mr."
1186,1,"Rushworth appeared precisely the young man to deserveand attach her.After dancing with each other at a proper number of balls, the youngpeople justified these opinions, and an engagement, with a duereference to the absent Sir Thomas, was entered into, much to thesatisfaction of their respective families, and of the generallookers-on of the neighbourhood, who had, for many weeks past, felt theexpediency of Mr."
1187,1,"Rushworth’s marrying Miss Bertram.It was some months before Sir Thomas’s consent could be received; but,in the meanwhile, as no one felt a doubt of his most cordial pleasurein the connexion, the intercourse of the two families was carried onwithout restraint, and no other attempt made at secrecy than Mrs.Norris’s talking of it everywhere as a matter not to be talked of atpresent.Edmund was the only one of the family who could see a fault in thebusiness; but no representation of his aunt’s could induce him to findMr."
1188,1,Rushworth a desirable companion.
1189,1,"He could allow his sister to bethe best judge of her own happiness, but he was not pleased that herhappiness should centre in a large income; nor could he refrain fromoften saying to himself, in Mr."
1190,1,"Rushworth’s company—“If this man hadnot twelve thousand a year, he would be a very stupid fellow.”Sir Thomas, however, was truly happy in the prospect of an alliance sounquestionably advantageous, and of which he heard nothing but theperfectly good and agreeable."
1191,1,"It was a connexion exactly of the rightsort—in the same county, and the same interest—and his most heartyconcurrence was conveyed as soon as possible."
1192,1,"He only conditioned thatthe marriage should not take place before his return, which he wasagain looking eagerly forward to."
1193,1,"He wrote in April, and had stronghopes of settling everything to his entire satisfaction, and leavingAntigua before the end of the summer.Such was the state of affairs in the month of July; and Fanny had justreached her eighteenth year, when the society of the village receivedan addition in the brother and sister of Mrs."
1194,1,"Grant, a Mr."
1195,1,"and MissCrawford, the children of her mother by a second marriage."
1196,1,They wereyoung people of fortune.
1197,1,"The son had a good estate in Norfolk, thedaughter twenty thousand pounds."
1198,1,"As children, their sister had beenalways very fond of them; but, as her own marriage had been soonfollowed by the death of their common parent, which left them to thecare of a brother of their father, of whom Mrs."
1199,1,"Grant knew nothing, shehad scarcely seen them since."
1200,1,In their uncle’s house they had found akind home.
1201,1,Admiral and Mrs.
1202,1,"Crawford, though agreeing in nothing else,were united in affection for these children, or, at least, were nofarther adverse in their feelings than that each had their favourite,to whom they showed the greatest fondness of the two."
1203,1,"The Admiraldelighted in the boy, Mrs."
1204,1,"Crawford doted on the girl; and it was thelady’s death which now obliged her _protegee_, after some months’further trial at her uncle’s house, to find another home."
1205,1,"AdmiralCrawford was a man of vicious conduct, who chose, instead of retaininghis niece, to bring his mistress under his own roof; and to this Mrs.Grant was indebted for her sister’s proposal of coming to her, ameasure quite as welcome on one side as it could be expedient on theother; for Mrs."
1206,1,"Grant, having by this time run through the usualresources of ladies residing in the country without a family ofchildren—having more than filled her favourite sitting-room with prettyfurniture, and made a choice collection of plants and poultry—was verymuch in want of some variety at home."
1207,1,"The arrival, therefore, of asister whom she had always loved, and now hoped to retain with her aslong as she remained single, was highly agreeable; and her chiefanxiety was lest Mansfield should not satisfy the habits of a youngwoman who had been mostly used to London.Miss Crawford was not entirely free from similar apprehensions, thoughthey arose principally from doubts of her sister’s style of living andtone of society; and it was not till after she had tried in vain topersuade her brother to settle with her at his own country house, thatshe could resolve to hazard herself among her other relations."
1208,1,"Toanything like a permanence of abode, or limitation of society, HenryCrawford had, unluckily, a great dislike: he could not accommodate hissister in an article of such importance; but he escorted her, with theutmost kindness, into Northamptonshire, and as readily engaged to fetchher away again, at half an hour’s notice, whenever she were weary ofthe place.The meeting was very satisfactory on each side."
1209,1,"Miss Crawford found asister without preciseness or rusticity, a sister’s husband who lookedthe gentleman, and a house commodious and well fitted up; and Mrs.Grant received in those whom she hoped to love better than ever a youngman and woman of very prepossessing appearance."
1210,1,"Mary Crawford wasremarkably pretty; Henry, though not handsome, had air and countenance;the manners of both were lively and pleasant, and Mrs."
1211,1,Grantimmediately gave them credit for everything else.
1212,1,"She was delightedwith each, but Mary was her dearest object; and having never been ableto glory in beauty of her own, she thoroughly enjoyed the power ofbeing proud of her sister’s."
1213,1,"She had not waited her arrival to look outfor a suitable match for her: she had fixed on Tom Bertram; the eldestson of a baronet was not too good for a girl of twenty thousand pounds,with all the elegance and accomplishments which Mrs."
1214,1,"Grant foresaw inher; and being a warm-hearted, unreserved woman, Mary had not beenthree hours in the house before she told her what she had planned.Miss Crawford was glad to find a family of such consequence so verynear them, and not at all displeased either at her sister’s early care,or the choice it had fallen on."
1215,1,"Matrimony was her object, provided shecould marry well: and having seen Mr."
1216,1,"Bertram in town, she knew thatobjection could no more be made to his person than to his situation inlife."
1217,1,"While she treated it as a joke, therefore, she did not forget tothink of it seriously."
1218,1,"The scheme was soon repeated to Henry.“And now,” added Mrs."
1219,1,"Grant, “I have thought of something to make itcomplete."
1220,1,"I should dearly love to settle you both in this country; andtherefore, Henry, you shall marry the youngest Miss Bertram, a nice,handsome, good-humoured, accomplished girl."
1221,1,"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home andhappy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings ofexistence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with verylittle to distress or vex her.She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister’s marriage,been mistress of his house from a very early period."
1222,1,"Her mother haddied too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembranceof her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent womanas governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr."
1223,1,"Woodhouse’s family, less as agoverness than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularlyof Emma."
1224,1,Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters.
1225,1,"Evenbefore Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess,the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose anyrestraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, theyhad been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached,and Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor’sjudgment, but directed chiefly by her own.The real evils, indeed, of Emma’s situation were the power of havingrather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little toowell of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy toher many enjoyments."
1226,1,"The danger, however, was at present sounperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes withher.Sorrow came—a gentle sorrow—but not at all in the shape of anydisagreeable consciousness.—Miss Taylor married."
1227,1,It was Miss Taylor’sloss which first brought grief.
1228,1,It was on the wedding-day of thisbeloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of anycontinuance.
1229,1,"The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her fatherand herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third tocheer a long evening."
1230,1,"Her father composed himself to sleep afterdinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what shehad lost.The event had every promise of happiness for her friend."
1231,1,Mr.
1232,1,"Weston wasa man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, andpleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering withwhat self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished andpromoted the match; but it was a black morning’s work for her."
1233,1,The wantof Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day.
1234,1,"She recalled herpast kindness—the kindness, the affection of sixteen years—how she hadtaught and how she had played with her from five years old—how she haddevoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health—and how nursedher through the various illnesses of childhood."
1235,1,"A large debt ofgratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years,the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followedIsabella’s marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet adearer, tenderer recollection."
1236,1,"She had been a friend and companion suchas few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowingall the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, andpeculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme ofhers—one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who hadsuch an affection for her as could never find fault.How was she to bear the change? It was true that her friend was goingonly half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be thedifference between a Mrs."
1237,1,"Weston, only half a mile from them, and aMiss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural anddomestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectualsolitude."
1238,1,"She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her.He could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr."
1239,1,"Woodhouse hadnot married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of mindor body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and thougheverywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiabletemper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, beingsettled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her dailyreach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggledthrough at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit fromIsabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house,and give her pleasant society again.Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, andname, did really belong, afforded her no equals."
1240,1,The Woodhouses werefirst in consequence there.
1241,1,All looked up to them.
1242,1,"She had manyacquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, butnot one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor foreven half a day."
1243,1,"It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not butsigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke,and made it necessary to be cheerful."
1244,1,His spirits required support.
1245,1,"Hewas a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he wasused to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind.Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he wasby no means yet reconciled to his own daughter’s marrying, nor couldever speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely amatch of affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylortoo; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never ableto suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, hewas very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing forherself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if shehad spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield."
1246,1,"Emma smiled andchatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; butwhen tea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he hadsaid at dinner,“Poor Miss Taylor!—I wish she were here again."
1247,1,What a pity it is thatMr.
1248,1,"Weston ever thought of her!”“I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot."
1249,1,Mr.
1250,1,"Weston is such agood-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves agood wife;—and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us forever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of herown?”“A house of her own!—But where is the advantage of a house of her own?This is three times as large.—And you have never any odd humours, mydear.”“How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!—Weshall be always meeting! _We_ must begin; we must go and pay weddingvisit very soon.”“My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance."
1251,1,"I couldnot walk half so far.”“No, papa, nobody thought of your walking."
1252,1,"We must go in the carriage,to be sure.”“The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such alittle way;—and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying ourvisit?”“They are to be put into Mr."
1253,1,"Weston’s stable, papa."
1254,1,You know we havesettled all that already.
1255,1,We talked it all over with Mr.
1256,1,Weston lastnight.
1257,1,"And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like goingto Randalls, because of his daughter’s being housemaid there."
1258,1,I onlydoubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else.
1259,1,"That was your doing,papa."
1260,1,You got Hannah that good place.
1261,1,Nobody thought of Hannah till youmentioned her—James is so obliged to you!”“I am very glad I did think of her.
1262,1,"It was very lucky, for I would nothave had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I amsure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spokengirl; I have a great opinion of her."
1263,1,"Whenever I see her, she alwayscurtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when youhave had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lockof the door the right way and never bangs it."
1264,1,I am sure she will be anexcellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylorto have somebody about her that she is used to see.
1265,1,"Whenever James goesover to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us."
1266,1,"He willbe able to tell her how we all are.”Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, andhoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably throughthe evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own."
1267,1,Thebackgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwardswalked in and made it unnecessary.Mr.
1268,1,"Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was notonly a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularlyconnected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella’s husband."
1269,1,"He livedabout a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from theirmutual connexions in London."
1270,1,"He had returned to a late dinner, aftersome days’ absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all werewell in Brunswick Square."
1271,1,"It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr.Woodhouse for some time."
1272,1,Mr.
1273,1,"Knightley had a cheerful manner, whichalways did him good; and his many inquiries after “poor Isabella” andher children were answered most satisfactorily."
1274,1,"When this was over, Mr.Woodhouse gratefully observed, “It is very kind of you, Mr."
1275,1,"Knightley,to come out at this late hour to call upon us."
1276,1,"I am afraid you musthave had a shocking walk.”“Not at all, sir."
1277,1,It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that Imust draw back from your great fire.”“But you must have found it very damp and dirty.
1278,1,"I wish you may notcatch cold.”“Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes."
1279,1,"Not a speck on them.”“Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rainhere."
1280,1,It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were atbreakfast.
1281,1,I wanted them to put off the wedding.”“By the bye—I have not wished you joy.
1282,1,"Being pretty well aware of whatsort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with mycongratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well."
1283,1,How did youall behave? Who cried most?”“Ah! poor Miss Taylor! ’Tis a sad business.”“Poor Mr.
1284,1,"and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say‘poor Miss Taylor.’ I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when itcomes to the question of dependence or independence!—At any rate, itmust be better to have only one to please than two.”“Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesomecreature!” said Emma playfully."
1285,1,"“That is what you have in your head, Iknow—and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.”“I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,” said Mr."
1286,1,"Woodhouse, witha sigh."
1287,1,"“I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.”“My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose Mr.Knightley to mean _you_."
1288,1,What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant onlymyself.
1289,1,Mr.
1290,1,"Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know—in ajoke—it is all a joke."
1291,1,We always say what we like to one another.”Mr.
1292,1,"Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faultsin Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: andthough this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew itwould be so much less so to her father, that she would not have himreally suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect byevery body.“Emma knows I never flatter her,” said Mr."
1293,1,"Knightley, “but I meant noreflection on any body."
1294,1,Miss Taylor has been used to have two personsto please; she will now have but one.
1295,1,"The chances are that she must bea gainer.”“Well,” said Emma, willing to let it pass—“you want to hear about thewedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behavedcharmingly."
1296,1,"Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks:not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen."
1297,1,"Oh no; we all felt thatwe were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meetingevery day.”“Dear Emma bears every thing so well,” said her father."
1298,1,"“But, Mr.Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I amsure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.”Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles."
1299,1,"“It isimpossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,” said Mr.Knightley."
1300,1,"“We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we couldsuppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor’sadvantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor’stime of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important toher to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allowherself to feel so much pain as pleasure."
1301,1,"Every friend of Miss Taylormust be glad to have her so happily married.”“And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,” said Emma, “and avery considerable one—that I made the match myself."
1302,1,"I made the match,you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved inthe right, when so many people said Mr."
1303,1,"Weston would never marry again,may comfort me for any thing.”Mr."
1304,1,Knightley shook his head at her.
1305,1,"Her father fondly replied, “Ah! mydear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, forwhatever you say always comes to pass."
1306,1,"Pray do not make any morematches.”“I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, forother people."
1307,1,"It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after suchsuccess, you know!—Every body said that Mr."
1308,1,Weston would never marryagain.
1309,1,"Oh dear, no! Mr."
1310,1,"Weston, who had been a widower so long, and whoseemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupiedeither in his business in town or among his friends here, alwaysacceptable wherever he went, always cheerful—Mr."
1311,1,Weston need not spenda single evening in the year alone if he did not like it.
1312,1,Oh no! Mr.Weston certainly would never marry again.
1313,1,"Some people even talked of apromise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and theuncle not letting him."
1314,1,"All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on thesubject, but I believed none of it.“Ever since the day—about four years ago—that Miss Taylor and I metwith him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he dartedaway with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us fromFarmer Mitchell’s, I made up my mind on the subject."
1315,1,"I planned thematch from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in thisinstance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave offmatch-making.”“I do not understand what you mean by ‘success,’” said Mr."
1316,1,Knightley.“Success supposes endeavour.
1317,1,"Your time has been properly and delicatelyspent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bringabout this marriage."
1318,1,"A worthy employment for a young lady’s mind! Butif, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it,means only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, ‘Ithink it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr."
1319,1,"Weston wereto marry her,’ and saying it again to yourself every now and thenafterwards, why do you talk of success? Where is your merit? What areyou proud of? You made a lucky guess; and _that_ is all that can besaid.”“And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?—Ipity you.—I thought you cleverer—for, depend upon it a lucky guess isnever merely luck."
1320,1,There is always some talent in it.
1321,1,"And as to my poorword ‘success,’ which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am soentirely without any claim to it."
1322,1,You have drawn two pretty pictures;but I think there may be a third—a something between the do-nothing andthe do-all.
1323,1,If I had not promoted Mr.
1324,1,"Weston’s visits here, and givenmany little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it mightnot have come to any thing after all."
1325,1,"I think you must know Hartfieldenough to comprehend that.”“A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage theirown concerns."
1326,1,"You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, thangood to them, by interference.”“Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,” rejoinedMr."
1327,1,"Woodhouse, understanding but in part."
1328,1,"“But, my dear, pray do notmake any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one’s familycircle grievously.”“Only one more, papa; only for Mr."
1329,1,Elton.
1330,1,Poor Mr.
1331,1,"Elton! You like Mr.Elton, papa,—I must look about for a wife for him."
1332,1,"There is nobody inHighbury who deserves him—and he has been here a whole year, and hasfitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to havehim single any longer—and I thought when he was joining their handsto-day, he looked so very much as if he would like to have the samekind office done for him! I think very well of Mr."
1333,1,"Elton, and this isthe only way I have of doing him a service.”“Mr."
1334,1,"Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very goodyoung man, and I have a great regard for him."
1335,1,"But if you want to shewhim any attention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day.That will be a much better thing."
1336,1,I dare say Mr.
1337,1,"Knightley will be sokind as to meet him.”“With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,” said Mr."
1338,1,"Knightley,laughing, “and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much betterthing."
1339,1,"Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best of the fishand the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife."
1340,1,"Depend upon it, aman of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself.”CHAPTER IIMr."
1341,1,"Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,which for the last two or three generations had been rising intogentility and property."
1342,1,"He had received a good education, but, onsucceeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposedfor any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged,and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper byentering into the militia of his county, then embodied.Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of hismilitary life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a greatYorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody wassurprized, except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, andwho were full of pride and importance, which the connexion wouldoffend.Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of herfortune—though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate—wasnot to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to theinfinite mortification of Mr."
1343,1,and Mrs.
1344,1,"Churchill, who threw her offwith due decorum."
1345,1,"It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not producemuch happiness."
1346,1,Mrs.
1347,1,"Weston ought to have found more in it, for she hada husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thingdue to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him;but though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best."
1348,1,"She hadresolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother, butnot enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother’sunreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.They lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparisonof Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted atonce to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst ofthe bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years’ marriage, hewas rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved."
1349,1,"The boyhad, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of hismother’s, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr."
1350,1,"and Mrs.Churchill, having no children of their own, nor any other youngcreature of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole chargeof the little Frank soon after her decease."
1351,1,"Some scruples and somereluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as theywere overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to thecare and the wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfortto seek, and his own situation to improve as he could.A complete change of life became desirable."
1352,1,"He quitted the militia andengaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way inLondon, which afforded him a favourable opening."
1353,1,It was a concern whichbrought just employment enough.
1354,1,"He had still a small house in Highbury,where most of his leisure days were spent; and between usefuloccupation and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twentyyears of his life passed cheerfully away."
1355,1,"He had, by that time,realised an easy competence—enough to secure the purchase of a littleestate adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed for—enough tomarry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live accordingto the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition.It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence hisschemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth, ithad not shaken his determination of never settling till he couldpurchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to;but he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they wereaccomplished."
1356,1,"He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtainedhis wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with everyprobability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through."
1357,1,"He hadnever been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that,even in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightfula well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him thepleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to bechosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own;for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as hisuncle’s heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assumethe name of Churchill on coming of age."
1358,1,"It was most unlikely,therefore, that he should ever want his father’s assistance."
1359,1,His fatherhad no apprehension of it.
1360,1,"The aunt was a capricious woman, andgoverned her husband entirely; but it was not in Mr."
1361,1,"Weston’s nature toimagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear,and, as he believed, so deservedly dear."
1362,1,"He saw his son every year inLondon, and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fineyoung man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too."
1363,1,He waslooked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits andprospects a kind of common concern.Mr.
1364,1,"Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a livelycuriosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so littlereturned that he had never been there in his life."
1365,1,"His coming to visithis father had been often talked of but never achieved.Now, upon his father’s marriage, it was very generally proposed, as amost proper attention, that the visit should take place."
1366,1,"There was nota dissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs."
1367,1,Perry drank teawith Mrs.
1368,1,"and Miss Bates, or when Mrs."
1369,1,and Miss Bates returned thevisit.
1370,1,Now was the time for Mr.
1371,1,Frank Churchill to come among them; andthe hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to hisnew mother on the occasion.
1372,1,"For a few days, every morning visit inHighbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs."
1373,1,Weston hadreceived.
1374,1,“I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr.
1375,1,FrankChurchill has written to Mrs.
1376,1,"Weston? I understand it was a veryhandsome letter, indeed."
1377,1,Mr.
1378,1,Woodhouse told me of it.
1379,1,Mr.
1380,1,"Woodhouse sawthe letter, and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in hislife.”It was, indeed, a highly prized letter."
1381,1,Mrs.
1382,1,"Weston had, of course,formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasingattention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a mostwelcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulationwhich her marriage had already secured."
1383,1,"She felt herself a mostfortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunateshe might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partialseparation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, andwho could ill bear to part with her.She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think, withoutpain, of Emma’s losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour’s ennui,from the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeblecharacter; she was more equal to her situation than most girls wouldhave been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hopedwould bear her well and happily through its little difficulties andprivations."
1384,1,"And then there was such comfort in the very easy distanceof Randalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary femalewalking, and in Mr."
1385,1,"Weston’s disposition and circumstances, which wouldmake the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half theevenings in the week together.Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs.Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction—her morethan satisfaction—her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent,that Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprizeat his being still able to pity ‘poor Miss Taylor,’ when they left herat Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go awayin the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of herown."
1386,1,But never did she go without Mr.
1387,1,"Woodhouse’s giving a gentle sigh,and saying, “Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay.”There was no recovering Miss Taylor—nor much likelihood of ceasing topity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr."
1388,1,"Woodhouse.The compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased bybeing wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, whichhad been a great distress to him, was all eat up."
1389,1,"His own stomach couldbear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to bedifferent from himself."
1390,1,"What was unwholesome to him he regarded asunfit for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuadethem from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, asearnestly tried to prevent any body’s eating it."
1391,1,He had been at thepains of consulting Mr.
1392,1,"Perry, the apothecary, on the subject."
1393,1,"Mr.Perry was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits wereone of the comforts of Mr."
1394,1,"Woodhouse’s life; and upon being applied to,he could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the biasof inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree withmany—perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately."
1395,1,"With such anopinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr."
1396,1,Woodhouse hoped to influenceevery visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten;and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys beingseen with a slice of Mrs.
1397,1,Weston’s wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr.Woodhouse would never believe it.CHAPTER IIIMr.
1398,1,Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way.
1399,1,"He liked very much tohave his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, fromhis long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune,his house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his ownlittle circle, in a great measure, as he liked."
1400,1,"He had not muchintercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horror of latehours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintancebut such as would visit him on his own terms."
1401,1,"Fortunately for him,Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey inthe parish adjoining, the seat of Mr."
1402,1,"Knightley, comprehended manysuch."
1403,1,"Not unfrequently, through Emma’s persuasion, he had some of thechosen and the best to dine with him: but evening parties were what hepreferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal tocompany, there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma couldnot make up a card-table for him.Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr."
1404,1,Knightley; andby Mr.
1405,1,"Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilegeof exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for theelegancies and society of Mr."
1406,1,"Woodhouse’s drawing-room, and the smilesof his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom wereMrs."
1407,1,"and Miss Bates, and Mrs."
1408,1,"Goddard, three ladies almost always atthe service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched andcarried home so often, that Mr."
1409,1,Woodhouse thought it no hardship foreither James or the horses.
1410,1,"Had it taken place only once a year, itwould have been a grievance.Mrs."
1411,1,"Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very oldlady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille."
1412,1,"She lived with hersingle daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all theregard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untowardcircumstances, can excite."
1413,1,"Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degreeof popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for havingmuch of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority tomake atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her intooutward respect."
1414,1,She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness.
1415,1,"Heryouth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life wasdevoted to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make asmall income go as far as possible."
1416,1,"And yet she was a happy woman, anda woman whom no one named without good-will."
1417,1,It was her own universalgood-will and contented temper which worked such wonders.
1418,1,"She lovedevery body, was interested in every body’s happiness, quicksighted toevery body’s merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, andsurrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many goodneighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing."
1419,1,"Thesimplicity and cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and gratefulspirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity toherself."
1420,1,"She was a great talker upon little matters, which exactlysuited Mr."
1421,1,"Woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmlessgossip.Mrs."
1422,1,"Goddard was the mistress of a School—not of a seminary, or anestablishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences ofrefined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegantmorality, upon new principles and new systems—and where young ladiesfor enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity—but areal, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonablequantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and wheregirls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves intoa little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies."
1423,1,"Mrs.Goddard’s school was in high repute—and very deservedly; for Highburywas reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house andgarden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run abouta great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains withher own hands."
1424,1,It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple nowwalked after her to church.
1425,1,"She was a plain, motherly kind of woman,who had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled tothe occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much toMr."
1426,1,"Woodhouse’s kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave herneat parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and winor lose a few sixpences by his fireside.These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able tocollect; and happy was she, for her father’s sake, in the power;though, as far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for theabsence of Mrs."
1427,1,Weston.
1428,1,"She was delighted to see her father lookcomfortable, and very much pleased with herself for contriving thingsso well; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel thatevery evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she hadfearfully anticipated.As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of thepresent day, a note was brought from Mrs."
1429,1,"Goddard, requesting, in mostrespectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her; a mostwelcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma knewvery well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of herbeauty."
1430,1,"A very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening nolonger dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody."
1431,1,"Somebody had placedher, several years back, at Mrs."
1432,1,"Goddard’s school, and somebody hadlately raised her from the condition of scholar to that ofparlour-boarder."
1433,1,"This was all that was generally known of her history.She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, andwas now just returned from a long visit in the country to some youngladies who had been at school there with her.She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sortwhich Emma particularly admired."
1434,1,"She was short, plump, and fair, with afine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look ofgreat sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as muchpleased with her manners as her person, and quite determined tocontinue the acquaintance.She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith’sconversation, but she found her altogether very engaging—notinconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk—and yet so far from pushing,shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantlygrateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed bythe appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she hadbeen used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement.Encouragement should be given."
1435,1,"Those soft blue eyes, and all thosenatural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society ofHighbury and its connexions."
1436,1,The acquaintance she had already formedwere unworthy of her.
1437,1,"The friends from whom she had just parted, thoughvery good sort of people, must be doing her harm."
1438,1,"They were a family ofthe name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting alarge farm of Mr."
1439,1,"Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell—verycreditably, she believed—she knew Mr."
1440,1,"Knightley thought highly ofthem—but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be theintimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge andelegance to be quite perfect."
1441,1,"_She_ would notice her; she would improveher; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce herinto good society; she would form her opinions and her manners."
1442,1,"Itwould be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking; highlybecoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers.She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking andlistening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that theevening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, whichalways closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit andwatch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards tothe fire, before she was aware."
1443,1,"With an alacrity beyond the commonimpulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit ofdoing every thing well and attentively, with the real good-will of amind delighted with its own ideas, did she then do all the honours ofthe meal, and help and recommend the minced chicken and scallopedoysters, with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to theearly hours and civil scruples of their guests.Upon such occasions poor Mr."
1444,1,"Woodhouse’s feelings were in sad warfare.He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of hisyouth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made himrather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitalitywould have welcomed his visitors to every thing, his care for theirhealth made him grieve that they would eat.Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that hecould, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he mightconstrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicerthings, to say:“Mrs."
1445,1,"Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs."
1446,1,An eggboiled very soft is not unwholesome.
1447,1,Serle understands boiling an eggbetter than any body.
1448,1,"I would not recommend an egg boiled by any bodyelse; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see—one ofour small eggs will not hurt you."
1449,1,"Miss Bates, let Emma help you to a_little_ bit of tart—a _very_ little bit."
1450,1,Ours are all apple-tarts.
1451,1,Youneed not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here.
1452,1,I do not advise thecustard.
1453,1,Mrs.
1454,1,"Goddard, what say you to _half_ a glass of wine? A_small_ half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think itcould disagree with you.”Emma allowed her father to talk—but supplied her visitors in a muchmore satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particularpleasure in sending them away happy."
1455,1,The happiness of Miss Smith wasquite equal to her intentions.
1456,1,"Miss Woodhouse was so great a personagein Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as muchpanic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off withhighly gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with whichMiss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening, and actually shakenhands with her at last!CHAPTER IVHarriet Smith’s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing."
1457,1,"Quickand decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging,and telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintanceincreased, so did their satisfaction in each other."
1458,1,"As a walkingcompanion, Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her.In that respect Mrs."
1459,1,Weston’s loss had been important.
1460,1,"Her father neverwent beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficedhim for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs.Weston’s marriage her exercise had been too much confined."
1461,1,"She hadventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a HarrietSmith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any time to a walk,would be a valuable addition to her privileges."
1462,1,"But in every respect,as she saw more of her, she approved her, and was confirmed in all herkind designs.Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, gratefuldisposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to beguided by any one she looked up to."
1463,1,"Her early attachment to herself wasvery amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power ofappreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no wantof taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected.Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith’s being exactly theyoung friend she wanted—exactly the something which her home required.Such a friend as Mrs."
1464,1,Weston was out of the question.
1465,1,Two such couldnever be granted.
1466,1,Two such she did not want.
1467,1,"It was quite a differentsort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent."
1468,1,Mrs.
1469,1,Weston wasthe object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem.Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful.
1470,1,"For Mrs.Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out whowere the parents, but Harriet could not tell."
1471,1,"She was ready to tellevery thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain."
1472,1,Emmawas obliged to fancy what she liked—but she could never believe that inthe same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth.
1473,1,Harriethad no penetration.
1474,1,She had been satisfied to hear and believe justwhat Mrs.
1475,1,Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.Mrs.
1476,1,"Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of theschool in general, formed naturally a great part of theconversation—and but for her acquaintance with the Martins ofAbbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole."
1477,1,"But the Martins occupiedher thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months withthem, and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describethe many comforts and wonders of the place."
1478,1,"Emma encouraged hertalkativeness—amused by such a picture of another set of beings, andenjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so muchexultation of Mrs."
1479,1,"Martin’s having “_two_ parlours, two very goodparlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs."
1480,1,"Goddard’sdrawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had livedfive-and-twenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two ofthem Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welchcow indeed; and of Mrs."
1481,1,"Martin’s saying as she was so fond of it, itshould be called _her_ cow; and of their having a very handsomesummer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all todrink tea:—a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozenpeople.”For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediatecause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelingsarose."
1482,1,"She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother anddaughter, a son and son’s wife, who all lived together; but when itappeared that the Mr."
1483,1,"Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and wasalways mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doingsomething or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs.Martin, no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor littlefriend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she werenot taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number andmeaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr."
1484,1,"Martin,and there was evidently no dislike to it."
1485,1,Harriet was very ready tospeak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merryevening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so verygood-humoured and obliging.
1486,1,"He had gone three miles round one day inorder to bring her some walnuts, because she had said how fond she wasof them, and in every thing else he was so very obliging."
1487,1,He had hisshepherd’s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her.She was very fond of singing.
1488,1,He could sing a little himself.
1489,1,"Shebelieved he was very clever, and understood every thing."
1490,1,"He had a veryfine flock, and, while she was with them, he had been bid more for hiswool than any body in the country."
1491,1,She believed every body spoke wellof him.
1492,1,His mother and sisters were very fond of him.
1493,1,Mrs.
1494,1,"Martin hadtold her one day (and there was a blush as she said it,) that it wasimpossible for any body to be a better son, and therefore she was sure,whenever he married, he would make a good husband."
1495,1,Not that she_wanted_ him to marry.
1496,1,"She was in no hurry at all.“Well done, Mrs."
1497,1,Martin!” thought Emma.
1498,1,"“You know what you are about.”“And when she had come away, Mrs."
1499,1,Martin was so very kind as to sendMrs.
1500,1,Goddard a beautiful goose—the finest goose Mrs.
1501,1,Goddard had everseen.
1502,1,Mrs.
1503,1,"Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the threeteachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup withher.”“Mr."
1504,1,"Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line ofhis own business? He does not read?”“Oh yes!—that is, no—I do not know—but I believe he has read a gooddeal—but not what you would think any thing of."
1505,1,"He reads theAgricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of thewindow seats—but he reads all _them_ to himself."
1506,1,"But sometimes of anevening, before we went to cards, he would read something aloud out ofthe Elegant Extracts, very entertaining."
1507,1,And I know he has read theVicar of Wakefield.
1508,1,"He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor TheChildren of the Abbey."
1509,1,"He had never heard of such books before Imentioned them, but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever hecan.”The next question was—“What sort of looking man is Mr."
1510,1,Martin?”“Oh! not handsome—not at all handsome.
1511,1,"I thought him very plain atfirst, but I do not think him so plain now."
1512,1,"One does not, you know,after a time."
1513,1,"But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every nowand then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way toKingston."
1514,1,"He has passed you very often.”“That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without havingany idea of his name."
1515,1,"A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot,is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity."
1516,1,The yeomanry areprecisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing todo.
1517,1,"A degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might interestme; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other.But a farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense,as much above my notice as in every other he is below it.”“To be sure."
1518,1,Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observedhim; but he knows you very well indeed—I mean by sight.”“I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man.
1519,1,"I know,indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well."
1520,1,"What do you imaginehis age to be?”“He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the23rd just a fortnight and a day’s difference—which is very odd.”“Only four-and-twenty."
1521,1,That is too young to settle.
1522,1,His mother isperfectly right not to be in a hurry.
1523,1,"They seem very comfortable asthey are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she wouldprobably repent it."
1524,1,"Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sortof young woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, itmight be very desirable.”“Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!”“Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who arenot born to an independence."
1525,1,Mr.
1526,1,"Martin, I imagine, has his fortuneentirely to make—cannot be at all beforehand with the world."
1527,1,"Whatevermoney he might come into when his father died, whatever his share ofthe family property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in hisstock, and so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he maybe rich in time, it is next to impossible that he should have realisedany thing yet.”“To be sure, so it is."
1528,1,But they live very comfortably.
1529,1,"They have noindoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs."
1530,1,"Martin talksof taking a boy another year.”“I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he doesmarry;—I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife—for though hissisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objectedto, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for youto notice."
1531,1,The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularlycareful as to your associates.
1532,1,"There can be no doubt of your being agentleman’s daughter, and you must support your claim to that stationby every thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of peoplewho would take pleasure in degrading you.”“Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are."
1533,1,"But while I visit at Hartfield,and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what anybody can do.”“You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but Iwould have you so firmly established in good society, as to beindependent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse."
1534,1,"I want to see youpermanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable tohave as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that ifyou should still be in this country when Mr."
1535,1,"Martin marries, I wish youmay not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquaintedwith the wife, who will probably be some mere farmer’s daughter,without education.”“To be sure."
1536,1,Yes.
1537,1,Not that I think Mr.
1538,1,Martin would ever marry any bodybut what had had some education—and been very well brought up.
1539,1,"However,I do not mean to set up my opinion against yours—and I am sure I shallnot wish for the acquaintance of his wife."
1540,1,"I shall always have a greatregard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and should be verysorry to give them up, for they are quite as well educated as me."
1541,1,"Butif he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better notvisit her, if I can help it.”Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw noalarming symptoms of love."
1542,1,"The young man had been the first admirer,but she trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be noserious difficulty, on Harriet’s side, to oppose any friendlyarrangement of her own.They met Mr."
1543,1,"Martin the very next day, as they were walking on theDonwell road."
1544,1,"He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully ather, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion."
1545,1,"Emma wasnot sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a fewyards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick eyesufficiently acquainted with Mr."
1546,1,Robert Martin.
1547,1,"His appearance was veryneat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his person had noother advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen, shethought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet’sinclination."
1548,1,Harriet was not insensible of manner; she had voluntarilynoticed her father’s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder.
1549,1,"Mr.Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was.They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not bekept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face,and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon tocompose.“Only think of our happening to meet him!—How very odd! It was quite achance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls."
1550,1,He did notthink we ever walked this road.
1551,1,He thought we walked towards Randallsmost days.
1552,1,"He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet.He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgotit, but he goes again to-morrow."
1553,1,"So very odd we should happen to meet!Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected? What do you thinkof him? Do you think him so very plain?”“He is very plain, undoubtedly—remarkably plain:—but that is nothingcompared with his entire want of gentility."
1554,1,"I had no right to expectmuch, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be sovery clownish, so totally without air."
1555,1,"I had imagined him, I confess, adegree or two nearer gentility.”“To be sure,” said Harriet, in a mortified voice, “he is not so genteelas real gentlemen.”“I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have beenrepeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that youmust yourself be struck with the difference in Mr."
1556,1,Martin.
1557,1,"AtHartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated, well bredmen."
1558,1,"I should be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be incompany with Mr."
1559,1,Martin again without perceiving him to be a veryinferior creature—and rather wondering at yourself for having everthought him at all agreeable before.
1560,1,"Do not you begin to feel that now?Were not you struck? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkwardlook and abrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard tobe wholly unmodulated as I stood here.”“Certainly, he is not like Mr."
1561,1,Knightley.
1562,1,He has not such a fine airand way of walking as Mr.
1563,1,Knightley.
1564,1,I see the difference plain enough.But Mr.
1565,1,Knightley is so very fine a man!”“Mr.
1566,1,Knightley’s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair tocompare Mr.
1567,1,Martin with _him_.
1568,1,You might not see one in a hundred with_gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr.
1569,1,Knightley.
1570,1,But he is not theonly gentleman you have been lately used to.
1571,1,What say you to Mr.
1572,1,Westonand Mr.
1573,1,Elton? Compare Mr.
1574,1,Martin with either of _them_.
1575,1,Compare theirmanner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of beingsilent.
1576,1,You must see the difference.”“Oh yes!—there is a great difference.
1577,1,But Mr.
1578,1,Weston is almost an oldman.
1579,1,Mr.
1580,1,Weston must be between forty and fifty.”“Which makes his good manners the more valuable.
1581,1,"The older a persongrows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should notbe bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, orawkwardness becomes."
1582,1,What is passable in youth is detestable in laterage.
1583,1,Mr.
1584,1,"Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr.Weston’s time of life?”“There is no saying, indeed,” replied Harriet rather solemnly.“But there may be pretty good guessing."
1585,1,"He will be a completely gross,vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking ofnothing but profit and loss.”“Will he, indeed? That will be very bad.”“How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from thecircumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thingelse—which is just as it should be, for a thriving man."
1586,1,"What has he todo with books? And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive, and be a veryrich man in time—and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb_us_.”“I wonder he did not remember the book”—was all Harriet’s answer, andspoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might besafely left to itself."
1587,1,"She, therefore, said no more for some time."
1588,1,"Hernext beginning was,“In one respect, perhaps, Mr."
1589,1,Elton’s manners are superior to Mr.Knightley’s or Mr.
1590,1,Weston’s.
1591,1,They have more gentleness.
1592,1,They might bemore safely held up as a pattern.
1593,1,"There is an openness, a quickness,almost a bluntness in Mr."
1594,1,"Weston, which every body likes in _him_,because there is so much good-humour with it—but that would not do tobe copied."
1595,1,Neither would Mr.
1596,1,"Knightley’s downright, decided, commandingsort of manner, though it suits _him_ very well; his figure, and look,and situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were toset about copying him, he would not be sufferable."
1597,1,"On the contrary, Ithink a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr."
1598,1,Elton asa model.
1599,1,Mr.
1600,1,"Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle."
1601,1,Heseems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late.
1602,1,"I do not knowwhether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us,Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners aresofter than they used to be."
1603,1,"If he means any thing, it must be toplease you."
1604,1,Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?”She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn fromMr.
1605,1,"Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled,and said she had always thought Mr."
1606,1,Elton very agreeable.Mr.
1607,1,Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the youngfarmer out of Harriet’s head.
1608,1,"She thought it would be an excellentmatch; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for herto have much merit in planning it."
1609,1,She feared it was what every bodyelse must think of and predict.
1610,1,"It was not likely, however, that anybody should have equalled her in the date of the plan, as it hadentered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet’s coming toHartfield."
1611,1,"The longer she considered it, the greater was her sense ofits expediency."
1612,1,Mr.
1613,1,"Elton’s situation was most suitable, quite thegentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not ofany family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.He had a comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficientincome; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was knownto have some independent property; and she thought very highly of himas a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man, without anydeficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautifulgirl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield, wasfoundation enough on his side; and on Harriet’s there could be littledoubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usualweight and efficacy."
1614,1,"And he was really a very pleasing young man, ayoung man whom any woman not fastidious might like."
1615,1,"He was reckonedvery handsome; his person much admired in general, though not by her,there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispensewith:—but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin’s ridingabout the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conqueredby Mr."
1616,1,"Elton’s admiration.CHAPTER V“I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs."
1617,1,"Weston,” said Mr.Knightley, “of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, butI think it a bad thing.”“A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?—why so?”“I think they will neither of them do the other any good.”“You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her witha new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good."
1618,1,I havebeen seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure.
1619,1,"How verydifferently we feel!—Not think they will do each other any good! Thiswill certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr.Knightley.”“Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowingWeston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.”“Mr."
1620,1,"Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, for hethinks exactly as I do on the subject."
1621,1,"We were speaking of it onlyyesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that thereshould be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with."
1622,1,"Mr.Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case."
1623,1,"Youare so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value of acompanion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort awoman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used toit all her life."
1624,1,I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith.
1625,1,She isnot the superior young woman which Emma’s friend ought to be.
1626,1,"But onthe other hand, as Emma wants to see her better informed, it will be aninducement to her to read more herself."
1627,1,They will read together.
1628,1,"Shemeans it, I know.”“Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve yearsold."
1629,1,"I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various timesof books that she meant to read regularly through—and very good liststhey were—very well chosen, and very neatly arranged—sometimesalphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule."
1630,1,"The list she drew upwhen only fourteen—I remember thinking it did her judgment so muchcredit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have madeout a very good list now."
1631,1,But I have done with expecting any course ofsteady reading from Emma.
1632,1,"She will never submit to any thing requiringindustry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to theunderstanding."
1633,1,"Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safelyaffirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.—You never could persuade herto read half so much as you wished.—You know you could not.”“I dare say,” replied Mrs."
1634,1,"Weston, smiling, “that I thought so_then_;—but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma’s omittingto do any thing I wished.”“There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_,”—saidMr."
1635,1,"Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done."
1636,1,"“But I,”he soon added, “who have had no such charm thrown over my senses, muststill see, hear, and remember."
1637,1,Emma is spoiled by being the cleverestof her family.
1638,1,"At ten years old, she had the misfortune of being ableto answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen."
1639,1,She wasalways quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident.
1640,1,"And ever sinceshe was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all."
1641,1,Inher mother she lost the only person able to cope with her.
1642,1,"She inheritsher mother’s talents, and must have been under subjection to her.”“I should have been sorry, Mr."
1643,1,"Knightley, to be dependent on _your_recommendation, had I quitted Mr."
1644,1,Woodhouse’s family and wanted anothersituation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me toany body.
1645,1,"I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.”“Yes,” said he, smiling."
1646,1,"“You are better placed _here_; very fit for awife, but not at all for a governess."
1647,1,But you were preparing yourselfto be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield.
1648,1,"You mightnot give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem topromise; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_, onthe very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, anddoing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him awife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor.”“Thank you."
1649,1,There will be very little merit in making a good wife tosuch a man as Mr.
1650,1,"Weston.”“Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, andthat with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne.We will not despair, however."
1651,1,"Weston may grow cross from the wantonnessof comfort, or his son may plague him.”“I hope not _that_.—It is not likely."
1652,1,"No, Mr."
1653,1,"Knightley, do notforetell vexation from that quarter.”“Not I, indeed."
1654,1,I only name possibilities.
1655,1,I do not pretend to Emma’sgenius for foretelling and guessing.
1656,1,"I hope, with all my heart, theyoung man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.—ButHarriet Smith—I have not half done about Harriet Smith."
1657,1,I think her thevery worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have.
1658,1,"She knowsnothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing."
1659,1,"She is aflatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned.Her ignorance is hourly flattery."
1660,1,"How can Emma imagine she has anything to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such a delightfulinferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that _she_cannot gain by the acquaintance."
1661,1,Hartfield will only put her out ofconceit with all the other places she belongs to.
1662,1,She will grow justrefined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth andcircumstances have placed her home.
1663,1,"I am much mistaken if Emma’sdoctrines give any strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girladapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation inlife.—They only give a little polish.”“I either depend more upon Emma’s good sense than you do, or am moreanxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.How well she looked last night!”“Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you? Verywell; I shall not attempt to deny Emma’s being pretty.”“Pretty! say beautiful rather."
1664,1,"Can you imagine any thing nearer perfectbeauty than Emma altogether—face and figure?”“I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldomseen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers."
1665,1,"But I am a partialold friend.”“Such an eye!—the true hazle eye—and so brilliant! regular features,open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, herglance."
1666,1,"One hears sometimes of a child being ‘the picture of health;’now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture ofgrown-up health."
1667,1,She is loveliness itself.
1668,1,Mr.
1669,1,"Knightley, is not she?”“I have not a fault to find with her person,” he replied."
1670,1,“I think herall you describe.
1671,1,"I love to look at her; and I will add this praise,that I do not think her personally vain."
1672,1,"Considering how very handsomeshe is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity liesanother way."
1673,1,Mrs.
1674,1,"Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike ofHarriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm.”“And I, Mr."
1675,1,"Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its notdoing them any harm."
1676,1,"With all dear Emma’s little faults, she is anexcellent creature."
1677,1,"Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kindersister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities which may betrusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make nolasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the right a hundredtimes.”“Very well; I will not plague you any more."
1678,1,"Emma shall be an angel, andI will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John andIsabella."
1679,1,"John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blindaffection, and Isabella always thinks as he does; except when he is notquite frightened enough about the children."
1680,1,"I am sure of having theiropinions with me.”“I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind;but excuse me, Mr."
1681,1,"Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself,you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma’smother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think anypossible good can arise from Harriet Smith’s intimacy being made amatter of much discussion among you."
1682,1,"Pray excuse me; but supposing anylittle inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot beexpected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father, who perfectlyapproves the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is asource of pleasure to herself."
1683,1,"It has been so many years my province togive advice, that you cannot be surprized, Mr."
1684,1,"Knightley, at thislittle remains of office.”“Not at all,” cried he; “I am much obliged to you for it."
1685,1,"It is verygood advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice has oftenfound; for it shall be attended to.”“Mrs."
1686,1,"John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy abouther sister.”“Be satisfied,” said he, “I will not raise any outcry."
1687,1,I will keep myill-humour to myself.
1688,1,I have a very sincere interest in Emma.
1689,1,Isabelladoes not seem more my sister; has never excited a greater interest;perhaps hardly so great.
1690,1,"There is an anxiety, a curiosity in what onefeels for Emma."
1691,1,"I wonder what will become of her!”“So do I,” said Mrs."
1692,1,"Weston gently, “very much.”“She always declares she will never marry, which, of course, means justnothing at all."
1693,1,But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man shecared for.
1694,1,It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in lovewith a proper object.
1695,1,"I should like to see Emma in love, and in somedoubt of a return; it would do her good."
1696,1,"But there is nobody hereaboutsto attach her; and she goes so seldom from home.”“There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break herresolution at present,” said Mrs."
1697,1,"Weston, “as can well be; and whileshe is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming anyattachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr.Woodhouse’s account."
1698,1,"I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma,though I mean no slight to the state, I assure you.”Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her ownand Mr."
1699,1,"Weston’s on the subject, as much as possible."
1700,1,"There were wishesat Randalls respecting Emma’s destiny, but it was not desirable to havethem suspected; and the quiet transition which Mr."
1701,1,"Knightley soonafterwards made to “What does Weston think of the weather; shall wehave rain?” convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmiseabout Hartfield.CHAPTER VIEmma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet’s fancy a properdirection and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very goodpurpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr.Elton’s being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners;and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of hisadmiration by agreeable hints, she was soon pretty confident ofcreating as much liking on Harriet’s side, as there could be anyoccasion for."
1702,1,She was quite convinced of Mr.
1703,1,"Elton’s being in thefairest way of falling in love, if not in love already."
1704,1,She had noscruple with regard to him.
1705,1,"He talked of Harriet, and praised her sowarmly, that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a littletime would not add."
1706,1,"His perception of the striking improvement ofHarriet’s manner, since her introduction at Hartfield, was not one ofthe least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment.“You have given Miss Smith all that she required,” said he; “you havemade her graceful and easy."
1707,1,"She was a beautiful creature when she cameto you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added areinfinitely superior to what she received from nature.”“I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet only wanteddrawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints."
1708,1,She had all thenatural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself.
1709,1,"I havedone very little.”“If it were admissible to contradict a lady,” said the gallant Mr.Elton—“I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, havetaught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before.”“Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me."
1710,1,"So much superaddeddecision of character! Skilful has been the hand!”“Great has been the pleasure, I am sure."
1711,1,"I never met with a dispositionmore truly amiable.”“I have no doubt of it.” And it was spoken with a sort of sighinganimation, which had a vast deal of the lover."
1712,1,"She was not less pleasedanother day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers,to have Harriet’s picture.“Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?” said she: “did youever sit for your picture?”Harriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say,with a very interesting naïveté,“Oh! dear, no, never.”No sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,“What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I wouldgive any money for it."
1713,1,"I almost long to attempt her likeness myself.You do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had a greatpassion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of my friends, andwas thought to have a tolerable eye in general."
1714,1,"But from one cause oranother, I gave it up in disgust."
1715,1,"But really, I could almost venture,if Harriet would sit to me."
1716,1,"It would be such a delight to have herpicture!”“Let me entreat you,” cried Mr."
1717,1,"Elton; “it would indeed be a delight!Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent infavour of your friend."
1718,1,I know what your drawings are.
1719,1,How could yousuppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens of yourlandscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs.
1720,1,"Weston some inimitablefigure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?”Yes, good man!—thought Emma—but what has all that to do with takinglikenesses? You know nothing of drawing."
1721,1,Don’t pretend to be inraptures about mine.
1722,1,Keep your raptures for Harriet’s face.
1723,1,"“Well, ifyou give me such kind encouragement, Mr."
1724,1,"Elton, I believe I shall trywhat I can do."
1725,1,"Harriet’s features are very delicate, which makes alikeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of theeye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch.”“Exactly so—The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth—I havenot a doubt of your success."
1726,1,"Pray, pray attempt it."
1727,1,"As you will do it,it will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession.”“But I am afraid, Mr."
1728,1,"Elton, Harriet will not like to sit."
1729,1,She thinksso little of her own beauty.
1730,1,"Did not you observe her manner ofanswering me? How completely it meant, ‘why should my picture bedrawn?’”“Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you."
1731,1,It was not lost on me.
1732,1,"But stillI cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.”Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against theearnest pressing of both the others."
1733,1,"Emma wished to go to workdirectly, and therefore produced the portfolio containing her variousattempts at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, thatthey might decide together on the best size for Harriet."
1734,1,Her manybeginnings were displayed.
1735,1,"Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths,pencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn."
1736,1,"She hadalways wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress both indrawing and music than many might have done with so little labour asshe would ever submit to."
1737,1,"She played and sang;—and drew in almost everystyle; but steadiness had always been wanting; and in nothing had sheapproached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad tocommand, and ought not to have failed of."
1738,1,"She was not much deceived asto her own skill either as an artist or a musician, but she was notunwilling to have others deceived, or sorry to know her reputation foraccomplishment often higher than it deserved.There was merit in every drawing—in the least finished, perhaps themost; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or hadthere been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her twocompanions would have been the same."
1739,1,They were both in ecstasies.
1740,1,"Alikeness pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse’s performances must becapital.“No great variety of faces for you,” said Emma."
1741,1,“I had only my ownfamily to study from.
1742,1,"There is my father—another of my father—but theidea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous, that I could onlytake him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore."
1743,1,Mrs.
1744,1,"Westonagain, and again, and again, you see."
1745,1,Dear Mrs.
1746,1,Weston! always mykindest friend on every occasion.
1747,1,She would sit whenever I asked her.There is my sister; and really quite her own little elegant figure!—andthe face not unlike.
1748,1,"I should have made a good likeness of her, if shewould have sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw herfour children that she would not be quiet."
1749,1,"Then, here come all myattempts at three of those four children;—there they are, Henry andJohn and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any one ofthem might do for any one of the rest."
1750,1,She was so eager to have themdrawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of threeor four years old stand still you know; n.
1751,2,"""THE BOTTOMS"" succeeded to ""Hell Row""."
1752,2,"Hell Row was a block of thatched, bulging cottages that stood by the brookside on Greenhill Lane."
1753,2,There lived the colliers who worked in the little gin-pits two fields away.
1754,2,"The brook ran under the alder trees, scarcely soiled by these small mines, whose coal was drawn to the surface by donkeys that plodded wearily in a circle round a gin."
1755,2,"And all over the countryside were these same pits, some of which had been worked in the time of Charles II, the few colliers and the donkeys burrowing down like ants into the earth, making queer mounds and little black places among the corn-fields and the meadows."
1756,2,"And the cottages of these coal-miners, in blocks and pairs here and there, together with odd farms and homes of the stockingers, straying over the parish, formed the village of Bestwood.Then, some sixty years ago, a sudden change took place, gin-pits were elbowed aside by the large mines of the financiers."
1757,2,The coal and iron field of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire was discovered.
1758,2,"Carston, Waite and Co."
1759,2,appeared.
1760,2,"Amid tremendous excitement, Lord Palmerston formally opened the company's first mine at Spinney Park, on the edge of Sherwood Forest.About this time the notorious Hell Row, which through growing old had acquired an evil reputation, was burned down, and much dirt was cleansed away.Carston, Waite & Co."
1761,2,"found they had struck on a good thing, so, down the valleys of the brooks from Selby and Nuttall, new mines were sunk, until soon there were six pits working."
1762,2,"From Nuttall, high up on the sandstone among the woods, the railway ran, past the ruined priory of the Carthusians and past Robin Hood's Well, down to Spinney Park, then on to Minton, a large mine among corn-fields; from Minton across the farmlands of the valleyside to Bunker's Hill, branching off there, and running north to Beggarlee and Selby, that looks over at Crich and the hills of Derbyshire: six mines like black studs on the countryside, linked by a loop of fine chain, the railway.To accommodate the regiments of miners, Carston, Waite and Co."
1763,2,"built the Squares, great quadrangles of dwellings on the hillside of Bestwood, and then, in the brook valley, on the site of Hell Row, they erected the Bottoms.The Bottoms consisted of six blocks of miners' dwellings, two rows of three, like the dots on a blank-six domino, and twelve houses in a block."
1764,2,"This double row of dwellings sat at the foot of the rather sharp slope from Bestwood, and looked out, from the attic windows at least, on the slow climb of the valley towards Selby.The houses themselves were substantial and very decent."
1765,2,"One could walk all round, seeing little front gardens with auriculas and saxifrage in the shadow of the bottom block, sweet-williams and pinks in the sunny top block; seeing neat front windows, little porches, little privet hedges, and dormer windows for the attics."
1766,2,But that was outside; that was the view on to the uninhabited parlours of all the colliers' wives.
1767,2,"The dwelling-room, the kitchen, was at the back of the house, facing inward between the blocks, looking at a scrubby back garden, and then at the ash-pits."
1768,2,"And between the rows, between the long lines of ash-pits, went the alley, where the children played and the women gossiped and the men smoked."
1769,2,"So, the actual conditions of living in the Bottoms, that was so well built and that looked so nice, were quite unsavoury because people must live in the kitchen, and the kitchens opened on to that nasty alley of ash-pits.Mrs."
1770,2,"Morel was not anxious to move into the Bottoms, which was already twelve years old and on the downward path, when she descended to it from Bestwood."
1771,2,But it was the best she could do.
1772,2,"Moreover, she had an end house in one of the top blocks, and thus had only one neighbour; on the other side an extra strip of garden."
1773,2,"And, having an end house, she enjoyed a kind of aristocracy among the other women of the ""between"" houses, because her rent was five shillings and sixpence instead of five shillings a week."
1774,2,But this superiority in station was not much consolation to Mrs.
1775,2,"Morel.She was thirty-one years old, and had been married eight years."
1776,2,"A rather small woman, of delicate mould but resolute bearing, she shrank a little from the first contact with the Bottoms women."
1777,2,"She came down in the July, and in the September expected her third baby.Her husband was a miner."
1778,2,"They had only been in their new home three weeks when the wakes, or fair, began."
1779,2,"Morel, she knew, was sure to make a holiday of it."
1780,2,"He went off early on the Monday morning, the day of the fair."
1781,2,The two children were highly excited.
1782,2,"William, a boy of seven, fled off immediately after breakfast, to prowl round the wakes ground, leaving Annie, who was only five, to whine all morning to go also."
1783,2,Mrs.
1784,2,Morel did her work.
1785,2,"She scarcely knew her neighbours yet, and knew no one with whom to trust the little girl."
1786,2,So she promised to take her to the wakes after dinner.William appeared at half-past twelve.
1787,2,"He was a very active lad, fair-haired, freckled, with a touch of the Dane or Norwegian about him.""Can I have my dinner, mother?"" he cried, rushing in with his cap on."
1788,2,"""'Cause it begins at half-past one, the man says so.""""You can have your dinner as soon as it's done,"" replied the mother.""Isn't it done?"" he cried, his blue eyes staring at her in indignation."
1789,2,"""Then I'm goin' be-out it.""""You'll do nothing of the sort."
1790,2,It will be done in five minutes.
1791,2,"It is only half-past twelve.""""They'll be beginnin',"" the boy half cried, half shouted.""You won't die if they do,"" said the mother."
1792,2,"""Besides, it's only half-past twelve, so you've a full hour.""The lad began hastily to lay the table, and directly the three sat down."
1793,2,"They were eating batter-pudding and jam, when the boy jumped off his chair and stood perfectly stiff."
1794,2,"Some distance away could be heard the first small braying of a merry-go-round, and the tooting of a horn."
1795,2,"His face quivered as he looked at his mother.""I told you!"" he said, running to the dresser for his cap.""Take your pudding in your hand—and it's only five past one, so you were wrong—you haven't got your twopence,"" cried the mother in a breath.The boy came back, bitterly disappointed, for his twopence, then went off without a word.""I want to go, I want to go,"" said Annie, beginning to cry.""Well, and you shall go, whining, wizzening little stick!"" said the mother."
1796,2,And later in the afternoon she trudged up the hill under the tall hedge with her child.
1797,2,"The hay was gathered from the fields, and cattle were turned on to the eddish."
1798,2,"It was warm, peaceful.Mrs."
1799,2,Morel did not like the wakes.
1800,2,"There were two sets of horses, one going by steam, one pulled round by a pony; three organs were grinding, and there came odd cracks of pistol-shots, fearful screeching of the cocoanut man's rattle, shouts of the Aunt Sally man, screeches from the peep-show lady."
1801,2,"The mother perceived her son gazing enraptured outside the Lion Wallace booth, at the pictures of this famous lion that had killed a negro and maimed for life two white men."
1802,2,"She left him alone, and went to get Annie a spin of toffee."
1803,2,"Presently the lad stood in front of her, wildly excited.""You never said you was coming—isn't the' a lot of things?—that lion's killed three men—I've spent my tuppence—an' look here.""He pulled from his pocket two egg-cups, with pink moss-roses on them.""I got these from that stall where y'ave ter get them marbles in them holes."
1804,2,"An' I got these two in two goes-'aepenny a go-they've got moss-roses on, look here."
1805,2,"I wanted these.""She knew he wanted them for her.""H'm!"" she said, pleased."
1806,2,"""They ARE pretty!""""Shall you carry 'em, 'cause I'm frightened o' breakin' 'em?""He was tipful of excitement now she had come, led her about the ground, showed her everything."
1807,2,"Then, at the peep-show, she explained the pictures, in a sort of story, to which he listened as if spellbound."
1808,2,He would not leave her.
1809,2,"All the time he stuck close to her, bristling with a small boy's pride of her."
1810,2,"For no other woman looked such a lady as she did, in her little black bonnet and her cloak."
1811,2,She smiled when she saw women she knew.
1812,2,"When she was tired she said to her son:""Well, are you coming now, or later?""""Are you goin' a'ready?"" he cried, his face full of reproach.""Already? It is past four, I know.""""What are you goin' a'ready for?"" he lamented.""You needn't come if you don't want,"" she said.And she went slowly away with her little girl, whilst her son stood watching her, cut to the heart to let her go, and yet unable to leave the wakes."
1813,2,"As she crossed the open ground in front of the Moon and Stars she heard men shouting, and smelled the beer, and hurried a little, thinking her husband was probably in the bar.At about half-past six her son came home, tired now, rather pale, and somewhat wretched."
1814,2,"He was miserable, though he did not know it, because he had let her go alone."
1815,2,"Since she had gone, he had not enjoyed his wakes.""Has my dad been?"" he asked.""No,"" said the mother.""He's helping to wait at the Moon and Stars."
1816,2,"I seed him through that black tin stuff wi' holes in, on the window, wi' his sleeves rolled up.""""Ha!"" exclaimed the mother shortly."
1817,2,"""He's got no money."
1818,2,"An' he'll be satisfied if he gets his 'lowance, whether they give him more or not.""When the light was fading, and Mrs."
1819,2,"Morel could see no more to sew, she rose and went to the door."
1820,2,"Everywhere was the sound of excitement, the restlessness of the holiday, that at last infected her."
1821,2,She went out into the side garden.
1822,2,"Women were coming home from the wakes, the children hugging a white lamb with green legs, or a wooden horse."
1823,2,"Occasionally a man lurched past, almost as full as he could carry."
1824,2,"Sometimes a good husband came along with his family, peacefully."
1825,2,But usually the women and children were alone.
1826,2,"The stay-at-home mothers stood gossiping at the corners of the alley, as the twilight sank, folding their arms under their white aprons.Mrs."
1827,2,"Morel was alone, but she was used to it."
1828,2,"Her son and her little girl slept upstairs; so, it seemed, her home was there behind her, fixed and stable."
1829,2,But she felt wretched with the coming child.
1830,2,"The world seemed a dreary place, where nothing else would happen for her—at least until William grew up."
1831,2,"But for herself, nothing but this dreary endurance—till the children grew up."
1832,2,And the children! She could not afford to have this third.
1833,2,She did not want it.
1834,2,"The father was serving beer in a public house, swilling himself drunk."
1835,2,"She despised him, and was tied to him."
1836,2,This coming child was too much for her.
1837,2,"If it were not for William and Annie, she was sick of it, the struggle with poverty and ugliness and meanness.She went into the front garden, feeling too heavy to take herself out, yet unable to stay indoors."
1838,2,The heat suffocated her.
1839,2,"And looking ahead, the prospect of her life made her feel as if she were buried alive.The front garden was a small square with a privet hedge."
1840,2,"There she stood, trying to soothe herself with the scent of flowers and the fading, beautiful evening."
1841,2,"Opposite her small gate was the stile that led uphill, under the tall hedge between the burning glow of the cut pastures."
1842,2,The sky overhead throbbed and pulsed with light.
1843,2,The glow sank quickly off the field; the earth and the hedges smoked dusk.
1844,2,"As it grew dark, a ruddy glare came out on the hilltop, and out of the glare the diminished commotion of the fair.Sometimes, down the trough of darkness formed by the path under the hedges, men came lurching home."
1845,2,"One young man lapsed into a run down the steep bit that ended the hill, and went with a crash into the stile."
1846,2,Mrs.
1847,2,Morel shuddered.
1848,2,"He picked himself up, swearing viciously, rather pathetically, as if he thought the stile had wanted to hurt him.She went indoors, wondering if things were never going to alter."
1849,2,She was beginning by now to realise that they would not.
1850,2,"She seemed so far away from her girlhood, she wondered if it were the same person walking heavily up the back garden at the Bottoms as had run so lightly up the breakwater at Sheerness ten years before.""What have I to do with it?"" she said to herself."
1851,2,"""What have I to do with all this? Even the child I am going to have! It doesn't seem as if I were taken into account.""Sometimes life takes hold of one, carries the body along, accomplishes one's history, and yet is not real, but leaves oneself as it were slurred over.""I wait,"" Mrs."
1852,2,"Morel said to herself—""I wait, and what I wait for can never come.""Then she straightened the kitchen, lit the lamp, mended the fire, looked out the washing for the next day, and put it to soak."
1853,2,After which she sat down to her sewing.
1854,2,Through the long hours her needle flashed regularly through the stuff.
1855,2,"Occasionally she sighed, moving to relieve herself."
1856,2,"And all the time she was thinking how to make the most of what she had, for the children's sakes.At half-past eleven her husband came."
1857,2,His cheeks were very red and very shiny above his black moustache.
1858,2,His head nodded slightly.
1859,2,"He was pleased with himself.""Oh! Oh! waitin' for me, lass? I've bin 'elpin' Anthony, an' what's think he's gen me? Nowt b'r a lousy hae'f-crown, an' that's ivry penny—""""He thinks you've made the rest up in beer,"" she said shortly.""An' I 'aven't—that I 'aven't."
1860,2,"You b'lieve me, I've 'ad very little this day, I have an' all."" His voice went tender."
1861,2,"""Here, an' I browt thee a bit o' brandysnap, an' a cocoanut for th' children."" He laid the gingerbread and the cocoanut, a hairy object, on the table."
1862,2,"""Nay, tha niver said thankyer for nowt i' thy life, did ter?""As a compromise, she picked up the cocoanut and shook it, to see if it had any milk.""It's a good 'un, you may back yer life o' that."
1863,2,I got it fra' Bill Hodgkisson.
1864,2,"'Bill,' I says, 'tha non wants them three nuts, does ter? Arena ter for gi'ein' me one for my bit of a lad an' wench?' 'I ham, Walter, my lad,' 'e says; 'ta'e which on 'em ter's a mind.' An' so I took one, an' thanked 'im."
1865,2,"I didn't like ter shake it afore 'is eyes, but 'e says, 'Tha'd better ma'e sure it's a good un, Walt.' An' so, yer see, I knowed it was."
1866,2,"He's a nice chap, is Bill Hodgkisson, e's a nice chap!""""A man will part with anything so long as he's drunk, and you're drunk along with him,"" said Mrs."
1867,2,"Morel.""Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy, who's drunk, I sh'd like ter know?"" said Morel."
1868,2,"He was extraordinarily pleased with himself, because of his day's helping to wait in the Moon and Stars."
1869,2,He chattered on.Mrs.
1870,2,"Morel, very tired, and sick of his babble, went to bed as quickly as possible, while he raked the fire.Mrs."
1871,2,"Morel came of a good old burgher family, famous independents who had fought with Colonel Hutchinson, and who remained stout Congregationalists."
1872,2,Her grandfather had gone bankrupt in the lace-market at a time when so many lace-manufacturers were ruined in Nottingham.
1873,2,"Her father, George Coppard, was an engineer—a large, handsome, haughty man, proud of his fair skin and blue eyes, but more proud still of his integrity."
1874,2,Gertrude resembled her mother in her small build.
1875,2,"But her temper, proud and unyielding, she had from the Coppards.George Coppard was bitterly galled by his own poverty."
1876,2,He became foreman of the engineers in the dockyard at Sheerness.
1877,2,Mrs.
1878,2,Morel—Gertrude—was the second daughter.
1879,2,"She favoured her mother, loved her mother best of all; but she had the Coppards' clear, defiant blue eyes and their broad brow."
1880,2,"She remembered to have hated her father's overbearing manner towards her gentle, humorous, kindly-souled mother."
1881,2,She remembered running over the breakwater at Sheerness and finding the boat.
1882,2,"She remembered to have been petted and flattered by all the men when she had gone to the dockyard, for she was a delicate, rather proud child."
1883,2,"She remembered the funny old mistress, whose assistant she had become, whom she had loved to help in the private school."
1884,2,And she still had the Bible that John Field had given her.
1885,2,She used to walk home from chapel with John Field when she was nineteen.
1886,2,"He was the son of a well-to-do tradesman, had been to college in London, and was to devote himself to business.She could always recall in detail a September Sunday afternoon, when they had sat under the vine at the back of her father's house."
1887,2,"The sun came through the chinks of the vine-leaves and made beautiful patterns, like a lace scarf, falling on her and on him."
1888,2,"Some of the leaves were clean yellow, like yellow flat flowers.""Now sit still,"" he had cried."
1889,2,"""Now your hair, I don't know what it IS like! It's as bright as copper and gold, as red as burnt copper, and it has gold threads where the sun shines on it."
1890,2,Fancy their saying it's brown.
1891,2,"Your mother calls it mouse-colour.""She had met his brilliant eyes, but her clear face scarcely showed the elation which rose within her.""But you say you don't like business,"" she pursued.""I don't."
1892,2,"I hate it!"" he cried hotly.""And you would like to go into the ministry,"" she half implored.""I should."
1893,2,"I should love it, if I thought I could make a first-rate preacher.""""Then why don't you—why DON'T you?"" Her voice rang with defiance."
1894,2,"""If I were a man, nothing would stop me.""She held her head erect."
1895,2,"He was rather timid before her.""But my father's so stiff-necked."
1896,2,"He means to put me into the business, and I know he'll do it.""""But if you're a MAN?"" she had cried.""Being a man isn't everything,"" he replied, frowning with puzzled helplessness.Now, as she moved about her work at the Bottoms, with some experience of what being a man meant, she knew that it was NOT everything.At twenty, owing to her health, she had left Sheerness."
1897,2,Her father had retired home to Nottingham.
1898,2,John Field's father had been ruined; the son had gone as a teacher in Norwood.
1899,2,"She did not hear of him until, two years later, she made determined inquiry."
1900,2,"He had married his landlady, a woman of forty, a widow with property.And still Mrs."
1901,2,Morel preserved John Field's Bible.
1902,2,"She did not now believe him to be—Well, she understood pretty well what he might or might not have been."
1903,2,"So she preserved his Bible, and kept his memory intact in her heart, for her own sake."
1904,2,"To her dying day, for thirty-five years, she did not speak of him.When she was twenty-three years old, she met, at a Christmas party, a young man from the Erewash Valley."
1905,2,Morel was then twenty-seven years old.
1906,2,"He was well set-up, erect, and very smart."
1907,2,"He had wavy black hair that shone again, and a vigorous black beard that had never been shaved."
1908,2,"His cheeks were ruddy, and his red, moist mouth was noticeable because he laughed so often and so heartily."
1909,2,"He had that rare thing, a rich, ringing laugh."
1910,2,"Gertrude Coppard had watched him, fascinated."
1911,2,"He was so full of colour and animation, his voice ran so easily into comic grotesque, he was so ready and so pleasant with everybody."
1912,2,"Her own father had a rich fund of humour, but it was satiric."
1913,2,"This man's was different: soft, non-intellectual, warm, a kind of gambolling.She herself was opposite."
1914,2,"She had a curious, receptive mind which found much pleasure and amusement in listening to other folk."
1915,2,She was clever in leading folk to talk.
1916,2,"She loved ideas, and was considered very intellectual."
1917,2,What she liked most of all was an argument on religion or philosophy or politics with some educated man.
1918,2,This she did not often enjoy.
1919,2,"So she always had people tell her about themselves, finding her pleasure so.In her person she was rather small and delicate, with a large brow, and dropping bunches of brown silk curls."
1920,2,"Her blue eyes were very straight, honest, and searching."
1921,2,She had the beautiful hands of the Coppards.
1922,2,Her dress was always subdued.
1923,2,"She wore dark blue silk, with a peculiar silver chain of silver scallops."
1924,2,"This, and a heavy brooch of twisted gold, was her only ornament."
1925,2,"She was still perfectly intact, deeply religious, and full of beautiful candour.Walter Morel seemed melted away before her."
1926,2,"She was to the miner that thing of mystery and fascination, a lady."
1927,2,"When she spoke to him, it was with a southern pronunciation and a purity of English which thrilled him to hear."
1928,2,She watched him.
1929,2,"He danced well, as if it were natural and joyous in him to dance."
1930,2,His grandfather was a French refugee who had married an English barmaid—if it had been a marriage.
1931,2,"Gertrude Coppard watched the young miner as he danced, a certain subtle exultation like glamour in his movement, and his face the flower of his body, ruddy, with tumbled black hair, and laughing alike whatever partner he bowed above."
1932,2,"She thought him rather wonderful, never having met anyone like him."
1933,2,Her father was to her the type of all men.
1934,2,"And George Coppard, proud in his bearing, handsome, and rather bitter; who preferred theology in reading, and who drew near in sympathy only to one man, the Apostle Paul; who was harsh in government, and in familiarity ironic; who ignored all sensuous pleasure:—he was very different from the miner."
1935,2,"Gertrude herself was rather contemptuous of dancing; she had not the slightest inclination towards that accomplishment, and had never learned even a Roger de Coverley."
1936,2,"She was puritan, like her father, high-minded, and really stern."
1937,2,"Therefore the dusky, golden softness of this man's sensuous flame of life, that flowed off his flesh like the flame from a candle, not baffled and gripped into incandescence by thought and spirit as her life was, seemed to her something wonderful, beyond her.He came and bowed above her."
1938,2,"A warmth radiated through her as if she had drunk wine.""Now do come and have this one wi' me,"" he said caressively."
1939,2,"""It's easy, you know."
1940,2,"I'm pining to see you dance.""She had told him before she could not dance."
1941,2,She glanced at his humility and smiled.
1942,2,Her smile was very beautiful.
1943,2,"It moved the man so that he forgot everything.""No, I won't dance,"" she said softly."
1944,2,"Her words came clean and ringing.Not knowing what he was doing—he often did the right thing by instinct—he sat beside her, inclining reverentially.""But you mustn't miss your dance,"" she reproved.""Nay, I don't want to dance that—it's not one as I care about.""""Yet you invited me to it.""He laughed very heartily at this.""I never thought o' that."
1945,2,"Tha'rt not long in taking the curl out of me.""It was her turn to laugh quickly.""You don't look as if you'd come much uncurled,"" she said.""I'm like a pig's tail, I curl because I canna help it,"" he laughed, rather boisterously.""And you are a miner!"" she exclaimed in surprise.""Yes."
1946,2,"I went down when I was ten.""She looked at him in wondering dismay.""When you were ten! And wasn't it very hard?"" she asked.""You soon get used to it."
1947,2,"You live like th' mice, an' you pop out at night to see what's going on.""""It makes me feel blind,"" she frowned.""Like a moudiwarp!"" he laughed."
1948,2,"""Yi, an' there's some chaps as does go round like moudiwarps."" He thrust his face forward in the blind, snout-like way of a mole, seeming to sniff and peer for direction."
1949,2,"""They dun though!"" he protested naively."
1950,2,"""Tha niver seed such a way they get in."
1951,2,"But tha mun let me ta'e thee down some time, an' tha can see for thysen.""She looked at him, startled."
1952,2,This was a new tract of life suddenly opened before her.
1953,2,"She realised the life of the miners, hundreds of them toiling below earth and coming up at evening."
1954,2,He seemed to her noble.
1955,2,"He risked his life daily, and with gaiety."
1956,2,"She looked at him, with a touch of appeal in her pure humility.""Shouldn't ter like it?"" he asked tenderly."
1957,2,"""'Appen not, it 'ud dirty thee.""She had never been ""thee'd"" and ""thou'd"" before.The next Christmas they were married, and for three months she was perfectly happy: for six months she was very happy.He had signed the pledge, and wore the blue ribbon of a tee-totaller: he was nothing if not showy."
1958,2,"They lived, she thought, in his own house."
1959,2,"It was small, but convenient enough, and quite nicely furnished, with solid, worthy stuff that suited her honest soul."
1960,2,"The women, her neighbours, were rather foreign to her, and Morel's mother and sisters were apt to sneer at her ladylike ways."
1961,2,"But she could perfectly well live by herself, so long as she had her husband close.Sometimes, when she herself wearied of love-talk, she tried to open her heart seriously to him."
1962,2,"She saw him listen deferentially, but without understanding."
1963,2,"This killed her efforts at a finer intimacy, and she had flashes of fear."
1964,2,"Sometimes he was restless of an evening: it was not enough for him just to be near her, she realised."
1965,2,She was glad when he set himself to little jobs.He was a remarkably handy man—could make or mend anything.
1966,2,"So she would say:""I do like that coal-rake of your mother's—it is small and natty.""""Does ter, my wench? Well, I made that, so I can make thee one!""""What! why, it's a steel one!""""An' what if it is! Tha s'lt ha'e one very similar, if not exactly same.""She did not mind the mess, nor the hammering and noise."
1967,2,"He was busy and happy.But in the seventh month, when she was brushing his Sunday coat, she felt papers in the breast pocket, and, seized with a sudden curiosity, took them out to read."
1968,2,He very rarely wore the frock-coat he was married in: and it had not occurred to her before to feel curious concerning the papers.
1969,2,"They were the bills of the household furniture, still unpaid.""Look here,"" she said at night, after he was washed and had had his dinner."
1970,2,"""I found these in the pocket of your wedding-coat."
1971,2,"Haven't you settled the bills yet?""""No."
1972,2,"I haven't had a chance.""""But you told me all was paid."
1973,2,I had better go into Nottingham on Saturday and settle them.
1974,2,"I don't like sitting on another man's chairs and eating from an unpaid table.""He did not answer.""I can have your bank-book, can't I?""""Tha can ha'e it, for what good it'll be to thee.""""I thought—"" she began."
1975,2,He had told her he had a good bit of money left over.
1976,2,But she realised it was no use asking questions.
1977,2,"She sat rigid with bitterness and indignation.The next day she went down to see his mother.""Didn't you buy the furniture for Walter?"" she asked.""Yes, I did,"" tartly retorted the elder woman.""And how much did he give you to pay for it?""The elder woman was stung with fine indignation.""Eighty pound, if you're so keen on knowin',"" she replied.""Eighty pounds! But there are forty-two pounds still owing!""""I can't help that.""""But where has it all gone?""""You'll find all the papers, I think, if you look—beside ten pound as he owed me, an' six pound as the wedding cost down here.""""Six pounds!"" echoed Gertrude Morel."
1978,2,"It seemed to her monstrous that, after her own father had paid so heavily for her wedding, six pounds more should have been squandered in eating and drinking at Walter's parents' house, at his expense.""And how much has he sunk in his houses?"" she asked.""His houses—which houses?""Gertrude Morel went white to the lips."
1979,2,"He had told her the house he lived in, and the next one, was his own.""I thought the house we live in—"" she began.""They're my houses, those two,"" said the mother-in-law."
1980,2,"""And not clear either."
1981,2,"It's as much as I can do to keep the mortgage interest paid.""Gertrude sat white and silent."
1982,2,"She was her father now.""Then we ought to be paying you rent,"" she said coldly.""Walter is paying me rent,"" replied the mother.""And what rent?"" asked Gertrude.""Six and six a week,"" retorted the mother.It was more than the house was worth."
1983,2,"Gertrude held her head erect, looked straight before her.""It is lucky to be you,"" said the elder woman, bitingly, ""to have a husband as takes all the worry of the money, and leaves you a free hand.""The young wife was silent.She said very little to her husband, but her manner had changed towards him."
1984,2,"Something in her proud, honourable soul had crystallised out hard as rock.When October came in, she thought only of Christmas."
1985,2,"Two years ago, at Christmas, she had met him."
1986,2,Last Christmas she had married him.
1987,2,"This Christmas she would bear him a child.""You don't dance yourself, do you, missis?"" asked her nearest neighbour, in October, when there was great talk of opening a dancing-class over the Brick and Tile Inn at Bestwood.""No—I never had the least inclination to,"" Mrs."
1988,2,"Morel replied.""Fancy! An' how funny as you should ha' married your Mester."
1989,2,"You know he's quite a famous one for dancing.""""I didn't know he was famous,"" laughed Mrs."
1990,2,"Morel.""Yea, he is though! Why, he ran that dancing-class in the Miners' Arms club-room for over five year.""""Did he?""""Yes, he did."" The other woman was defiant."
1991,2,"""An' it was thronged every Tuesday, and Thursday, an' Sat'day—an' there WAS carryin's-on, accordin' to all accounts.""This kind of thing was gall and bitterness to Mrs."
1992,2,"Morel, and she had a fair share of it."
1993,2,"The women did not spare her, at first; for she was superior, though she could not help it.He began to be rather late in coming home.""They're working very late now, aren't they?"" she said to her washer-woman.""No later than they allers do, I don't think."
1994,2,"But they stop to have their pint at Ellen's, an' they get talkin', an' there you are! Dinner stone cold—an' it serves 'em right.""""But Mr."
1995,2,"Morel does not take any drink.""The woman dropped the clothes, looked at Mrs."
1996,2,"Morel, then went on with her work, saying nothing.Gertrude Morel was very ill when the boy was born."
1997,2,"Morel was good to her, as good as gold."
1998,2,"But she felt very lonely, miles away from her own people."
1999,2,"She felt lonely with him now, and his presence only made it more intense.The boy was small and frail at first, but he came on quickly."
2000,2,"He was a beautiful child, with dark gold ringlets, and dark-blue eyes which changed gradually to a clear grey."
2001,2,His mother loved him passionately.
2002,2,"He came just when her own bitterness of disillusion was hardest to bear; when her faith in life was shaken, and her soul felt dreary and lonely."
2003,2,"She made much of the child, and the father was jealous.At last Mrs."
2004,2,Morel despised her husband.
2005,2,She turned to the child; she turned from the father.
2006,2,He had begun to neglect her; the novelty of his own home was gone.
2007,2,"He had no grit, she said bitterly to herself."
2008,2,"What he felt just at the minute, that was all to him."
2009,2,He could not abide by anything.
2010,2,"There was nothing at the back of all his show.There began a battle between the husband and wife—a fearful, bloody battle that ended only with the death of one."
2011,2,"She fought to make him undertake his own responsibilities, to make him fulfill his obligations."
2012,2,But he was too different from her.
2013,2,"His nature was purely sensuous, and she strove to make him moral, religious."
2014,2,She tried to force him to face things.
2015,2,"He could not endure it—it drove him out of his mind.While the baby was still tiny, the father's temper had become so irritable that it was not to be trusted."
2016,2,The child had only to give a little trouble when the man began to bully.
2017,2,"A little more, and the hard hands of the collier hit the baby."
2018,2,Then Mrs.
2019,2,"Morel loathed her husband, loathed him for days; and he went out and drank; and she cared very little what he did."
2020,2,"Only, on his return, she scathed him with her satire.The estrangement between them caused him, knowingly or unknowingly, grossly to offend her where he would not have done.William was only one year old, and his mother was proud of him, he was so pretty."
2021,2,"She was not well off now, but her sisters kept the boy in clothes."
2022,2,"Then, with his little white hat curled with an ostrich feather, and his white coat, he was a joy to her, the twining wisps of hair clustering round his head."
2023,2,Mrs.
2024,2,"Morel lay listening, one Sunday morning, to the chatter of the father and child downstairs."
2025,2,Then she dozed off.
2026,2,"When she came downstairs, a great fire glowed in the grate, the room was hot, the breakfast was roughly laid, and seated in his armchair, against the chimney-piece, sat Morel, rather timid; and standing between his legs, the child—cropped like a sheep, with such an odd round poll—looking wondering at her; and on a newspaper spread out upon the hearthrug, a myriad of crescent-shaped curls, like the petals of a marigold scattered in the reddening firelight.Mrs."
2027,2,Morel stood still.
2028,2,It was her first baby.
2029,2,"She went very white, and was unable to speak.""What dost think o' 'im?"" Morel laughed uneasily.She gripped her two fists, lifted them, and came forward."
2030,2,"Morel shrank back.""I could kill you, I could!"" she said."
2031,2,"She choked with rage, her two fists uplifted.""Yer non want ter make a wench on 'im,"" Morel said, in a frightened tone, bending his head to shield his eyes from hers."
2032,2,"His attempt at laughter had vanished.The mother looked down at the jagged, close-clipped head of her child."
2033,2,"She put her hands on his hair, and stroked and fondled his head.""Oh—my boy!"" she faltered."
2034,2,"Her lip trembled, her face broke, and, snatching up the child, she buried her face in his shoulder and cried painfully."
2035,2,She was one of those women who cannot cry; whom it hurts as it hurts a man.
2036,2,"It was like ripping something out of her, her sobbing.Morel sat with his elbows on his knees, his hands gripped together till the knuckles were white."
2037,2,"He gazed in the fire, feeling almost stunned, as if he could not breathe.Presently she came to an end, soothed the child and cleared away the breakfast-table."
2038,2,"She left the newspaper, littered with curls, spread upon the hearthrug."
2039,2,At last her husband gathered it up and put it at the back of the fire.
2040,2,She went about her work with closed mouth and very quiet.
2041,2,Morel was subdued.
2042,2,"He crept about wretchedly, and his meals were a misery that day."
2043,2,"She spoke to him civilly, and never alluded to what he had done."
2044,2,"But he felt something final had happened.Afterwards she said she had been silly, that the boy's hair would have had to be cut, sooner or later."
2045,2,"In the end, she even brought herself to say to her husband it was just as well he had played barber when he did."
2046,2,"But she knew, and Morel knew, that that act had caused something momentous to take place in her soul."
2047,2,"She remembered the scene all her life, as one in which she had suffered the most intensely.This act of masculine clumsiness was the spear through the side of her love for Morel."
2048,2,"Before, while she had striven against him bitterly, she had fretted after him, as if he had gone astray from her."
2049,2,Now she ceased to fret for his love: he was an outsider to her.
2050,2,"This made life much more bearable.Nevertheless, she still continued to strive with him."
2051,2,"She still had her high moral sense, inherited from generations of Puritans."
2052,2,"It was now a religious instinct, and she was almost a fanatic with him, because she loved him, or had loved him."
2053,2,"If he sinned, she tortured him."
2054,2,"If he drank, and lied, was often a poltroon, sometimes a knave, she wielded the lash unmercifully.The pity was, she was too much his opposite."
2055,2,She could not be content with the little he might be; she would have him the much that he ought to be.
2056,2,"So, in seeking to make him nobler than he could be, she destroyed him."
2057,2,"She injured and hurt and scarred herself, but she lost none of her worth."
2058,2,"She also had the children.He drank rather heavily, though not more than many miners, and always beer, so that whilst his health was affected, it was never injured."
2059,2,The week-end was his chief carouse.
2060,2,"He sat in the Miners' Arms until turning-out time every Friday, every Saturday, and every Sunday evening."
2061,2,On Monday and Tuesday he had to get up and reluctantly leave towards ten o'clock.
2062,2,"Sometimes he stayed at home on Wednesday and Thursday evenings, or was only out for an hour."
2063,2,"He practically never had to miss work owing to his drinking.But although he was very steady at work, his wages fell off."
2064,2,"He was blab-mouthed, a tongue-wagger."
2065,2,"Authority was hateful to him, therefore he could only abuse the pit-managers."
2066,2,"He would say, in the Palmerston:""Th' gaffer come down to our stall this morning, an' 'e says, 'You know, Walter, this 'ere'll not do."
2067,2,"What about these props?' An' I says to him, 'Why, what art talkin' about? What d'st mean about th' props?' 'It'll never do, this 'ere,' 'e says."
2068,2,"'You'll be havin' th' roof in, one o' these days.' An' I says, 'Tha'd better stan' on a bit o' clunch, then, an' hold it up wi' thy 'ead.' So 'e wor that mad, 'e cossed an' 'e swore, an' t'other chaps they did laugh."" Morel was a good mimic."
2069,2,"He imitated the manager's fat, squeaky voice, with its attempt at good English.""'I shan't have it, Walter."
2070,2,"Who knows more about it, me or you?' So I says, 'I've niver fun out how much tha' knows, Alfred."
2071,2,"It'll 'appen carry thee ter bed an' back.""'So Morel would go on to the amusement of his boon companions."
2072,2,And some of this would be true.
2073,2,The pit-manager was not an educated man.
2074,2,"He had been a boy along with Morel, so that, while the two disliked each other, they more or less took each other for granted."
2075,2,But Alfred Charlesworth did not forgive the butty these public-house sayings.
2076,2,"Consequently, although Morel was a good miner, sometimes earning as much as five pounds a week when he married, he came gradually to have worse and worse stalls, where the coal was thin, and hard to get, and unprofitable.Also, in summer, the pits are slack."
2077,2,"Often, on bright sunny mornings, the men are seen trooping home again at ten, eleven, or twelve o'clock."
2078,2,No empty trucks stand at the pit-mouth.
2079,2,"The women on the hillside look across as they shake the hearthrug against the fence, and count the wagons the engine is taking along the line up the valley."
2080,2,"And the children, as they come from school at dinner-time, looking down the fields and seeing the wheels on the headstocks standing, say:""Minton's knocked off."
2081,2,"My dad'll be at home.""And there is a sort of shadow over all, women and children and men, because money will be short at the end of the week.Morel was supposed to give his wife thirty shillings a week, to provide everything—rent, food, clothes, clubs, insurance, doctors."
2082,2,"Occasionally, if he were flush, he gave her thirty-five."
2083,2,But these occasions by no means balanced those when he gave her twenty-five.
2084,2,"In winter, with a decent stall, the miner might earn fifty or fifty-five shillings a week."
2085,2,Then he was happy.
2086,2,"On Friday night, Saturday, and Sunday, he spent royally, getting rid of his sovereign or thereabouts."
2087,2,"And out of so much, he scarcely spared the children an extra penny or bought them a pound of apples."
2088,2,It all went in drink.
2089,2,"In the bad times, matters were more worrying, but he was not so often drunk, so that Mrs."
2090,2,"Morel used to say:""I'm not sure I wouldn't rather be short, for when he's flush, there isn't a minute of peace.""If he earned forty shillings he kept ten; from thirty-five he kept five; from thirty-two he kept four; from twenty-eight he kept three; from twenty-four he kept two; from twenty he kept one-and-six; from eighteen he kept a shilling; from sixteen he kept sixpence."
2091,2,"He never saved a penny, and he gave his wife no opportunity of saving; instead, she had occasionally to pay his debts; not public-house debts, for those never were passed on to the women, but debts when he had bought a canary, or a fancy walking-stick.At the wakes time Morel was working badly, and Mrs."
2092,2,Morel was trying to save against her confinement.
2093,2,"So it galled her bitterly to think he should be out taking his pleasure and spending money, whilst she remained at home, harassed."
2094,2,There were two days' holiday.
2095,2,On the Tuesday morning Morel rose early.
2096,2,He was in good spirits.
2097,2,"Quite early, before six o'clock, she heard him whistling away to himself downstairs."
2098,2,"He had a pleasant way of whistling, lively and musical."
2099,2,He nearly always whistled hymns.
2100,2,"He had been a choir-boy with a beautiful voice, and had taken solos in Southwell cathedral."
2101,2,"His morning whistling alone betrayed it.His wife lay listening to him tinkering away in the garden, his whistling ringing out as he sawed and hammered away."
2102,2,"It always gave her a sense of warmth and peace to hear him thus as she lay in bed, the children not yet awake, in the bright early morning, happy in his man's fashion.At nine o'clock, while the children with bare legs and feet were sitting playing on the sofa, and the mother was washing up, he came in from his carpentry, his sleeves rolled up, his waistcoat hanging open."
2103,2,"He was still a good-looking man, with black, wavy hair, and a large black moustache."
2104,2,"His face was perhaps too much inflamed, and there was about him a look almost of peevishness."
2105,2,But now he was jolly.
2106,2,"He went straight to the sink where his wife was washing up.""What, are thee there!"" he said boisterously."
2107,2,"""Sluthe off an' let me wesh mysen.""""You may wait till I've finished,"" said his wife.""Oh, mun I? An' what if I shonna?""This good-humoured threat amused Mrs."
2108,2,"Morel.""Then you can go and wash yourself in the soft-water tub.""""Ha! I can' an' a', tha mucky little 'ussy.""With which he stood watching her a moment, then went away to wait for her.When he chose he could still make himself again a real gallant."
2109,2,Usually he preferred to go out with a scarf round his neck.
2110,2,"Now, however, he made a toilet."
2111,2,"There seemed so much gusto in the way he puffed and swilled as he washed himself, so much alacrity with which he hurried to the mirror in the kitchen, and, bending because it was too low for him, scrupulously parted his wet black hair, that it irritated Mrs."
2112,2,Morel.
2113,2,"He put on a turn-down collar, a black bow, and wore his Sunday tail-coat."
2114,2,"As such, he looked spruce, and what his clothes would not do, his instinct for making the most of his good looks would.At half-past nine Jerry Purdy came to call for his pal."
2115,2,"Jerry was Morel's bosom friend, and Mrs."
2116,2,Morel disliked him.
2117,2,"He was a tall, thin man, with a rather foxy face, the kind of face that seems to lack eyelashes."
2118,2,"He walked with a stiff, brittle dignity, as if his head were on a wooden spring."
2119,2,His nature was cold and shrewd.
2120,2,"Generous where he intended to be generous, he seemed to be very fond of Morel, and more or less to take charge of him.Mrs."
2121,2,Morel hated him.
2122,2,"She had known his wife, who had died of consumption, and who had, at the end, conceived such a violent dislike of her husband, that if he came into her room it caused her haemorrhage."
2123,2,None of which Jerry had seemed to mind.
2124,2,"And now his eldest daughter, a girl of fifteen, kept a poor house for him, and looked after the two younger children.""A mean, wizzen-hearted stick!"" Mrs."
2125,2,"Morel said of him.""I've never known Jerry mean in MY life,"" protested Morel."
2126,2,"""A opener-handed and more freer chap you couldn't find anywhere, accordin' to my knowledge.""""Open-handed to you,"" retorted Mrs."
2127,2,Morel.
2128,2,"""But his fist is shut tight enough to his children, poor things.""""Poor things! And what for are they poor things, I should like to know.""But Mrs."
2129,2,"Morel would not be appeased on Jerry's score.The subject of argument was seen, craning his thin neck over the scullery curtain."
2130,2,He caught Mrs.
2131,2,"Morel's eye.""Mornin', missis! Mester in?""""Yes—he is.""Jerry entered unasked, and stood by the kitchen doorway."
2132,2,"He was not invited to sit down, but stood there, coolly asserting the rights of men and husbands.""A nice day,"" he said to Mrs."
2133,2,"Morel.""Yes.""Grand out this morning—grand for a walk.""""Do you mean YOU'RE going for a walk?"" she asked.""Yes."
2134,2,"We mean walkin' to Nottingham,"" he replied.""H'm!""The two men greeted each other, both glad: Jerry, however, full of assurance, Morel rather subdued, afraid to seem too jubilant in presence of his wife."
2135,2,"But he laced his boots quickly, with spirit."
2136,2,They were going for a ten-mile walk across the fields to Nottingham.
2137,2,"Climbing the hillside from the Bottoms, they mounted gaily into the morning."
2138,2,"At the Moon and Stars they had their first drink, then on to the Old Spot."
2139,2,Then a long five miles of drought to carry them into Bulwell to a glorious pint of bitter.
2140,2,"But they stayed in a field with some haymakers whose gallon bottle was full, so that, when they came in sight of the city, Morel was sleepy."
2141,2,"The town spread upwards before them, smoking vaguely in the midday glare, fridging the crest away to the south with spires and factory bulks and chimneys."
2142,2,In the last field Morel lay down under an oak tree and slept soundly for over an hour.
2143,2,"When he rose to go forward he felt queer.The two had dinner in the Meadows, with Jerry's sister, then repaired to the Punch Bowl, where they mixed in the excitement of pigeon-racing."
2144,2,"Morel never in his life played cards, considering them as having some occult, malevolent power—""the devil's pictures,"" he called them! But he was a master of skittles and of dominoes."
2145,2,"He took a challenge from a Newark man, on skittles."
2146,2,"All the men in the old, long bar took sides, betting either one way or the other."
2147,2,Morel took off his coat.
2148,2,Jerry held the hat containing the money.
2149,2,The men at the tables watched.
2150,2,Some stood with their mugs in their hands.
2151,2,"Morel felt his big wooden ball carefully, then launched it."
2152,2,"He played havoc among the nine-pins, and won half a crown, which restored him to solvency.By seven o'clock the two were in good condition."
2153,2,They caught the 7.30 train home.In the afternoon the Bottoms was intolerable.
2154,2,Every inhabitant remaining was out of doors.
2155,2,"The women, in twos and threes, bareheaded and in white aprons, gossiped in the alley between the blocks."
2156,2,"Men, having a rest between drinks, sat on their heels and talked."
2157,2,The place smelled stale; the slate roofs glistered in the arid heat.Mrs.
2158,2,"Morel took the little girl down to the brook in the meadows, which were not more than two hundred yards away."
2159,2,The water ran quickly over stones and broken pots.
2160,2,"Mother and child leaned on the rail of the old sheep-bridge, watching."
2161,2,"Up at the dipping-hole, at the other end of the meadow, Mrs."
2162,2,"Morel could see the naked forms of boys flashing round the deep yellow water, or an occasional bright figure dart glittering over the blackish stagnant meadow."
2163,2,"She knew William was at the dipping-hole, and it was the dread of her life lest he should get drowned."
2164,2,"Annie played under the tall old hedge, picking up alder cones, that she called currants."
2165,2,"The child required much attention, and the flies were teasing.The children were put to bed at seven o'clock."
2166,2,"Then she worked awhile.When Walter Morel and Jerry arrived at Bestwood they felt a load off their minds; a railway journey no longer impended, so they could put the finishing touches to a glorious day."
2167,2,"They entered the Nelson with the satisfaction of returned travellers.The next day was a work-day, and the thought of it put a damper on the men's spirits."
2168,2,"Most of them, moreover, had spent their money."
2169,2,"Some were already rolling dismally home, to sleep in preparation for the morrow."
2170,2,Mrs.
2171,2,"Morel, listening to their mournful singing, went indoors."
2172,2,"Nine o'clock passed, and ten, and still ""the pair"" had not returned."
2173,2,"On a doorstep somewhere a man was singing loudly, in a drawl: ""Lead, kindly Light."" Mrs."
2174,2,"Morel was always indignant with the drunken men that they must sing that hymn when they got maudlin.""As if 'Genevieve' weren't good enough,"" she said.The kitchen was full of the scent of boiled herbs and hops."
2175,2,On the hob a large black saucepan steamed slowly.
2176,2,Mrs.
2177,2,"Morel took a panchion, a great bowl of thick red earth, streamed a heap of white sugar into the bottom, and then, straining herself to the weight, was pouring in the liquor.Just then Morel came in."
2178,2,"He had been very jolly in the Nelson, but coming home had grown irritable."
2179,2,"He had not quite got over the feeling of irritability and pain, after having slept on the ground when he was so hot; and a bad conscience afflicted him as he neared the house."
2180,2,He did not know he was angry.
2181,2,"But when the garden gate resisted his attempts to open it, he kicked it and broke the latch."
2182,2,He entered just as Mrs.
2183,2,Morel was pouring the infusion of herbs out of the saucepan.
2184,2,"Swaying slightly, he lurched against the table."
2185,2,The boiling liquor pitched.
2186,2,Mrs.
2187,2,"Morel started back.""Good gracious,"" she cried, ""coming home in his drunkenness!""""Comin' home in his what?"" he snarled, his hat over his eye.Suddenly her blood rose in a jet.""Say you're NOT drunk!"" she flashed.She had put down her saucepan, and was stirring the sugar into the beer."
2188,2,"He dropped his two hands heavily on the table, and thrust his face forwards at her.""'Say you're not drunk,'"" he repeated."
2189,2,"""Why, nobody but a nasty little bitch like you 'ud 'ave such a thought.""He thrust his face forward at her.""There's money to bezzle with, if there's money for nothing else.""""I've not spent a two-shillin' bit this day,"" he said.""You don't get as drunk as a lord on nothing,"" she replied."
2190,2,"""And,"" she cried, flashing into sudden fury, ""if you've been sponging on your beloved Jerry, why, let him look after his children, for they need it.""""It's a lie, it's a lie."
2191,2,"Shut your face, woman.""They were now at battle-pitch."
2192,2,Each forgot everything save the hatred of the other and the battle between them.
2193,2,She was fiery and furious as he.
2194,2,"They went on till he called her a liar.""No,"" she cried, starting up, scarce able to breathe."
2195,2,"""Don't call me that—you, the most despicable liar that ever walked in shoe-leather."" She forced the last words out of suffocated lungs.""You're a liar!"" he yelled, banging the table with his fist."
2196,2,"""You're a liar, you're a liar.""She stiffened herself, with clenched fists.""The house is filthy with you,"" she cried.""Then get out on it—it's mine."
2197,2,"Get out on it!"" he shouted."
2198,2,"""It's me as brings th' money whoam, not thee."
2199,2,"It's my house, not thine."
2200,2,"Then ger out on't—ger out on't!""""And I would,"" she cried, suddenly shaken into tears of impotence."
2201,2,"""Ah, wouldn't I, wouldn't I have gone long ago, but for those children."
2202,2,"Ay, haven't I repented not going years ago, when I'd only the one""—suddenly drying into rage."
2203,2,"""Do you think it's for YOU I stop—do you think I'd stop one minute for YOU?""""Go, then,"" he shouted, beside himself."
2204,2,"""Go!""""No!"" She faced round."
2205,2,"""No,"" she cried loudly, ""you shan't have it ALL your own way; you shan't do ALL you like."
2206,2,I've got those children to see to.
2207,2,"My word,"" she laughed, ""I should look well to leave them to you.""""Go,"" he cried thickly, lifting his fist."
2208,2,He was afraid of her.
2209,2,"""Go!""""I should be only too glad."
2210,2,"I should laugh, laugh, my lord, if I could get away from you,"" she replied.He came up to her, his red face, with its bloodshot eyes, thrust forward, and gripped her arms."
2211,2,"She cried in fear of him, struggled to be free."
2212,2,"Coming slightly to himself, panting, he pushed her roughly to the outer door, and thrust her forth, slotting the bolt behind her with a bang."
2213,2,"Then he went back into the kitchen, dropped into his armchair, his head, bursting full of blood, sinking between his knees."
2214,2,"Thus he dipped gradually into a stupor, from exhaustion and intoxication.The moon was high and magnificent in the August night."
2215,2,Mrs.
2216,2,"Morel, seared with passion, shivered to find herself out there in a great white light, that fell cold on her, and gave a shock to her inflamed soul."
2217,2,She stood for a few moments helplessly staring at the glistening great rhubarb leaves near the door.
2218,2,Then she got the air into her breast.
2219,2,"She walked down the garden path, trembling in every limb, while the child boiled within her."
2220,2,"For a while she could not control her consciousness; mechanically she went over the last scene, then over it again, certain phrases, certain moments coming each time like a brand red-hot down on her soul; and each time she enacted again the past hour, each time the brand came down at the same points, till the mark was burnt in, and the pain burnt out, and at last she came to herself."
2221,2,She must have been half an hour in this delirious condition.
2222,2,Then the presence of the night came again to her.
2223,2,She glanced round in fear.
2224,2,"She had wandered to the side garden, where she was walking up and down the path beside the currant bushes under the long wall."
2225,2,"The garden was a narrow strip, bounded from the road, that cut transversely between the blocks, by a thick thorn hedge.She hurried out of the side garden to the front, where she could stand as if in an immense gulf of white light, the moon streaming high in face of her, the moonlight standing up from the hills in front, and filling the valley where the Bottoms crouched, almost blindingly."
2226,2,"There, panting and half weeping in reaction from the stress, she murmured to herself over and over again: ""The nuisance! the nuisance!""She became aware of something about her."
2227,2,With an effort she roused herself to see what it was that penetrated her consciousness.
2228,2,"The tall white lilies were reeling in the moonlight, and the air was charged with their perfume, as with a presence."
2229,2,Mrs.
2230,2,Morel gasped slightly in fear.
2231,2,"She touched the big, pallid flowers on their petals, then shivered."
2232,2,They seemed to be stretching in the moonlight.
2233,2,She put her hand into one white bin: the gold scarcely showed on her fingers by moonlight.
2234,2,She bent down to look at the binful of yellow pollen; but it only appeared dusky.
2235,2,Then she drank a deep draught of the scent.
2236,2,It almost made her dizzy.Mrs.
2237,2,"Morel leaned on the garden gate, looking out, and she lost herself awhile."
2238,2,She did not know what she thought.
2239,2,"Except for a slight feeling of sickness, and her consciousness in the child, herself melted out like scent into the shiny, pale air."
2240,2,"After a time the child, too, melted with her in the mixing-pot of moonlight, and she rested with the hills and lilies and houses, all swum together in a kind of swoon.When she came to herself she was tired for sleep."
2241,2,"Languidly she looked about her; the clumps of white phlox seemed like bushes spread with linen; a moth ricochetted over them, and right across the garden."
2242,2,Following it with her eye roused her.
2243,2,"A few whiffs of the raw, strong scent of phlox invigorated her."
2244,2,"She passed along the path, hesitating at the white rose-bush."
2245,2,It smelled sweet and simple.
2246,2,She touched the white ruffles of the roses.
2247,2,"Their fresh scent and cool, soft leaves reminded her of the morning-time and sunshine."
2248,2,She was very fond of them.
2249,2,"But she was tired, and wanted to sleep."
2250,2,In the mysterious out-of-doors she felt forlorn.There was no noise anywhere.
2251,2,"Evidently the children had not been wakened, or had gone to sleep again."
2252,2,"A train, three miles away, roared across the valley."
2253,2,"The night was very large, and very strange, stretching its hoary distances infinitely."
2254,2,"And out of the silver-grey fog of darkness came sounds vague and hoarse: a corncrake not far off, sound of a train like a sigh, and distant shouts of men.Her quietened heart beginning to beat quickly again, she hurried down the side garden to the back of the house."
2255,2,"Softly she lifted the latch; the door was still bolted, and hard against her."
2256,2,"She rapped gently, waited, then rapped again."
2257,2,"She must not rouse the children, nor the neighbours."
2258,2,"He must be asleep, and he would not wake easily."
2259,2,Her heart began to burn to be indoors.
2260,2,She clung to the door-handle.
2261,2,"Now it was cold; she would take a chill, and in her present condition!Putting her apron over her head and her arms, she hurried again to the side garden, to the window of the kitchen."
2262,2,"Leaning on the sill, she could just see, under the blind, her husband's arms spread out on the table, and his black head on the board."
2263,2,He was sleeping with his face lying on the table.
2264,2,Something in his attitude made her feel tired of things.
2265,2,The lamp was burning smokily; she could tell by the copper colour of the light.
2266,2,She tapped at the window more and more noisily.
2267,2,Almost it seemed as if the glass would break.
2268,2,"Still he did not wake up.After vain efforts, she began to shiver, partly from contact with the stone, and from exhaustion."
2269,2,"Fearful always for the unborn child, she wondered what she could do for warmth."
2270,2,"She went down to the coal-house, where there was an old hearthrug she had carried out for the rag-man the day before."
2271,2,This she wrapped over her shoulders.
2272,2,"It was warm, if grimy."
2273,2,"Then she walked up and down the garden path, peeping every now and then under the blind, knocking, and telling herself that in the end the very strain of his position must wake him.At last, after about an hour, she rapped long and low at the window."
2274,2,Gradually the sound penetrated to him.
2275,2,"When, in despair, she had ceased to tap, she saw him stir, then lift his face blindly."
2276,2,The labouring of his heart hurt him into consciousness.
2277,2,She rapped imperatively at the window.
2278,2,He started awake.
2279,2,Instantly she saw his fists set and his eyes glare.
2280,2,He had not a grain of physical fear.
2281,2,"If it had been twenty burglars, he would have gone blindly for them."
2282,2,"He glared round, bewildered, but prepared to fight.""Open the door, Walter,"" she said coldly.His hands relaxed."
2283,2,It dawned on him what he had done.
2284,2,"His head dropped, sullen and dogged."
2285,2,"She saw him hurry to the door, heard the bolt chock."
2286,2,He tried the latch.
2287,2,"It opened—and there stood the silver-grey night, fearful to him, after the tawny light of the lamp."
2288,2,He hurried back.When Mrs.
2289,2,"Morel entered, she saw him almost running through the door to the stairs."
2290,2,"He had ripped his collar off his neck in his haste to be gone ere she came in, and there it lay with bursten button-holes."
2291,2,It made her angry.She warmed and soothed herself.
2292,2,"In her weariness forgetting everything, she moved about at the little tasks that remained to be done, set his breakfast, rinsed his pit-bottle, put his pit-clothes on the hearth to warm, set his pit-boots beside them, put him out a clean scarf and snap-bag and two apples, raked the fire, and went to bed."
2293,2,He was already dead asleep.
2294,2,"His narrow black eyebrows were drawn up in a sort of peevish misery into his forehead while his cheeks' down-strokes, and his sulky mouth, seemed to be saying: ""I don't care who you are nor what you are, I SHALL have my own way.""Mrs."
2295,2,Morel knew him too well to look at him.
2296,2,"As she unfastened her brooch at the mirror, she smiled faintly to see her face all smeared with the yellow dust of lilies."
2297,2,"She brushed it off, and at last lay down."
2298,2,"For some time her mind continued snapping and jetting sparks, but she was asleep before her husband awoke from the first sleep of his drunkenness.CHAPTER IITHE BIRTH OF PAUL, AND ANOTHER BATTLEAFTER such a scene as the last, Walter Morel was for some days abashed and ashamed, but he soon regained his old bullying indifference."
2299,2,"Yet there was a slight shrinking, a diminishing in his assurance."
2300,2,"Physically even, he shrank, and his fine full presence waned."
2301,2,"He never grew in the least stout, so that, as he sank from his erect, assertive bearing, his physique seemed to contract along with his pride and moral strength.But now he realised how hard it was for his wife to drag about at her work, and, his sympathy quickened by penitence, hastened forward with his help."
2302,2,"He came straight home from the pit, and stayed in at evening till Friday, and then he could not remain at home."
2303,2,"But he was back again by ten o'clock, almost quite sober.He always made his own breakfast."
2304,2,"Being a man who rose early and had plenty of time he did not, as some miners do, drag his wife out of bed at six o'clock."
2305,2,"At five, sometimes earlier, he woke, got straight out of bed, and went downstairs."
2306,2,"When she could not sleep, his wife lay waiting for this time, as for a period of peace."
2307,2,"The only real rest seemed to be when he was out of the house.He went downstairs in his shirt and then struggled into his pit-trousers, which were left on the hearth to warm all night."
2308,2,"There was always a fire, because Mrs."
2309,2,Morel raked.
2310,2,"And the first sound in the house was the bang, bang of the poker against the raker, as Morel smashed the remainder of the coal to make the kettle, which was filled and left on the hob, finally boil."
2311,2,"His cup and knife and fork, all he wanted except just the food, was laid ready on the table on a newspaper."
2312,2,"Then he got his breakfast, made the tea, packed the bottom of the doors with rugs to shut out the draught, piled a big fire, and sat down to an hour of joy."
2313,2,"He toasted his bacon on a fork and caught the drops of fat on his bread; then he put the rasher on his thick slice of bread, and cut off chunks with a clasp-knife, poured his tea into his saucer, and was happy."
2314,2,"With his family about, meals were never so pleasant."
2315,2,He loathed a fork: it is a modern introduction which has still scarcely reached common people.
2316,2,What Morel preferred was a clasp-knife.
2317,2,"Then, in solitude, he ate and drank, often sitting, in cold weather, on a little stool with his back to the warm chimney-piece, his food on the fender, his cup on the hearth."
2318,2,And then he read the last night's newspaper—what of it he could—spelling it over laboriously.
2319,2,"He preferred to keep the blinds down and the candle lit even when it was daylight; it was the habit of the mine.At a quarter to six he rose, cut two thick slices of bread and butter, and put them in the white calico snap-bag."
2320,2,He filled his tin bottle with tea.
2321,2,Cold tea without milk or sugar was the drink he preferred for the pit.
2322,2,"Then he pulled off his shirt, and put on his pit-singlet, a vest of thick flannel cut low round the neck, and with short sleeves like a chemise.Then he went upstairs to his wife with a cup of tea because she was ill, and because it occurred to him.""I've brought thee a cup o' tea, lass,"" he said.""Well, you needn't, for you know I don't like it,"" she replied.""Drink it up; it'll pop thee off to sleep again.""She accepted the tea."
2323,2,"It pleased him to see her take it and sip it.""I'll back my life there's no sugar in,"" she said.""Yi—there's one big 'un,"" he replied, injured.""It's a wonder,"" she said, sipping again.She had a winsome face when her hair was loose."
2324,2,He loved her to grumble at him in this manner.
2325,2,"He looked at her again, and went, without any sort of leave-taking."
2326,2,"He never took more than two slices of bread and butter to eat in the pit, so an apple or an orange was a treat to him."
2327,2,He always liked it when she put one out for him.
2328,2,"He tied a scarf round his neck, put on his great, heavy boots, his coat, with the big pocket, that carried his snap-bag and his bottle of tea, and went forth into the fresh morning air, closing, without locking, the door behind him."
2329,2,"He loved the early morning, and the walk across the fields."
2330,2,"So he appeared at the pit-top, often with a stalk from the hedge between his teeth, which he chewed all day to keep his mouth moist, down the mine, feeling quite as happy as when he was in the field.Later, when the time for the baby grew nearer, he would bustle round in his slovenly fashion, poking out the ashes, rubbing the fireplace, sweeping the house before he went to work."
2331,2,"Then, feeling very self-righteous, he went upstairs.""Now I'm cleaned up for thee: tha's no 'casions ter stir a peg all day, but sit and read thy books.""Which made her laugh, in spite of her indignation.""And the dinner cooks itself?"" she answered.""Eh, I know nowt about th' dinner.""""You'd know if there weren't any.""""Ay, 'appen so,"" he answered, departing.When she got downstairs, she would find the house tidy, but dirty."
2332,2,She could not rest until she had thoroughly cleaned; so she went down to the ash-pit with her dustpan.
2333,2,Mrs.
2334,2,"Kirk, spying her, would contrive to have to go to her own coal-place at that minute."
2335,2,"Then, across the wooden fence, she would call:""So you keep wagging on, then?""""Ay,"" answered Mrs."
2336,2,Morel deprecatingly.
2337,2,"""There's nothing else for it.""""Have you seen Hose?"" called a very small woman from across the road."
2338,2,It was Mrs.
2339,2,"Anthony, a black-haired, strange little body, who always wore a brown velvet dress, tight fitting.""I haven't,"" said Mrs."
2340,2,"Morel.""Eh, I wish he'd come."
2341,2,"I've got a copperful of clothes, an' I'm sure I heered his bell.""""Hark! He's at the end.""The two women looked down the alley."
2342,2,"At the end of the Bottoms a man stood in a sort of old-fashioned trap, bending over bundles of cream-coloured stuff; while a cluster of women held up their arms to him, some with bundles."
2343,2,Mrs.
2344,2,"Anthony herself had a heap of creamy, undyed stockings hanging over her arm.""I've done ten dozen this week,"" she said proudly to Mrs."
2345,2,"Morel.""T-t-t!"" went the other."
2346,2,"""I don't know how you can find time.""""Eh!"" said Mrs."
2347,2,Anthony.
2348,2,"""You can find time if you make time.""""I don't know how you do it,"" said Mrs."
2349,2,Morel.
2350,2,"""And how much shall you get for those many?""""Tuppence-ha'penny a dozen,"" replied the other.""Well,"" said Mrs."
2351,2,Morel.
2352,2,"""I'd starve before I'd sit down and seam twenty-four stockings for twopence ha'penny.""""Oh, I don't know,"" said Mrs."
2353,2,Anthony.
2354,2,"""You can rip along with 'em.""Hose was coming along, ringing his bell."
2355,2,Women were waiting at the yard-ends with their seamed stockings hanging over their arms.
2356,2,"The man, a common fellow, made jokes with them, tried to swindle them, and bullied them."
2357,2,Mrs.
2358,2,"Morel went up her yard disdainfully.It was an understood thing that if one woman wanted her neighbour, she should put the poker in the fire and bang at the back of the fireplace, which, as the fires were back to back, would make a great noise in the adjoining house."
2359,2,One morning Mrs.
2360,2,"Kirk, mixing a pudding, nearly started out of her skin as she heard the thud, thud, in her grate."
2361,2,"With her hands all floury, she rushed to the fence.""Did you knock, Mrs."
2362,2,"Morel?""""If you wouldn't mind, Mrs."
2363,2,"Kirk.""Mrs."
2364,2,"Kirk climbed on to her copper, got over the wall on to Mrs."
2365,2,"Morel's copper, and ran in to her neighbour.""Eh, dear, how are you feeling?"" she cried in concern.""You might fetch Mrs."
2366,2,"Bower,"" said Mrs."
2367,2,Morel.Mrs.
2368,2,"Kirk went into the yard, lifted up her strong, shrill voice, and called:""Ag-gie—Ag-gie!""The sound was heard from one end of the Bottoms to the other."
2369,2,"At last Aggie came running up, and was sent for Mrs."
2370,2,"Bower, whilst Mrs."
2371,2,Kirk left her pudding and stayed with her neighbour.Mrs.
2372,2,Morel went to bed.
2373,2,Mrs.
2374,2,Kirk had Annie and William for dinner.
2375,2,Mrs.
2376,2,"Bower, fat and waddling, bossed the house.""Hash some cold meat up for the master's dinner, and make him an apple-charlotte pudding,"" said Mrs."
2377,2,"Morel.""He may go without pudding this day,"" said Mrs."
2378,2,"Bower.Morel was not as a rule one of the first to appear at the bottom of the pit, ready to come up."
2379,2,"Some men were there before four o'clock, when the whistle blew loose-all; but Morel, whose stall, a poor one, was at this time about a mile and a half away from the bottom, worked usually till the first mate stopped, then he finished also."
2380,2,"This day, however, the miner was sick of the work."
2381,2,"At two o'clock he looked at his watch, by the light of the green candle—he was in a safe working—and again at half-past two."
2382,2,He was hewing at a piece of rock that was in the way for the next day's work.
2383,2,"As he sat on his heels, or kneeled, giving hard blows with his pick, ""Uszza—uszza!"" he went.""Shall ter finish, Sorry?"" cried Barker, his fellow butty.""Finish? Niver while the world stands!"" growled Morel.And he went on striking."
2384,2,"He was tired.""It's a heart-breaking job,"" said Barker.But Morel was too exasperated, at the end of his tether, to answer."
2385,2,"Still he struck and hacked with all his might.""Tha might as well leave it, Walter,"" said Barker."
2386,2,"""It'll do to-morrow, without thee hackin' thy guts out.""""I'll lay no b—— finger on this to-morrow, Isr'el!"" cried Morel.""Oh, well, if tha wunna, somebody else'll ha'e to,"" said Israel.Then Morel continued to strike.""Hey-up there—LOOSE-A'!"" cried the men, leaving the next stall.Morel continued to strike.""Tha'll happen catch me up,"" said Barker, departing.When he had gone, Morel, left alone, felt savage."
2387,2,He had not finished his job.
2388,2,He had overworked himself into a frenzy.
2389,2,"Rising, wet with sweat, he threw his tool down, pulled on his coat, blew out his candle, took his lamp, and went."
2390,2,Down the main road the lights of the other men went swinging.
2391,2,There was a hollow sound of many voices.
2392,2,"It was a long, heavy tramp underground.He sat at the bottom of the pit, where the great drops of water fell plash."
2393,2,"Many colliers were waiting their turns to go up, talking noisily."
2394,2,"Morel gave his answers short and disagreeable.""It's rainin', Sorry,"" said old Giles, who had had the news from the top.Morel found one comfort."
2395,2,"He had his old umbrella, which he loved, in the lamp cabin."
2396,2,"At last he took his stand on the chair, and was at the top in a moment."
2397,2,"Then he handed in his lamp and got his umbrella, which he had bought at an auction for one-and-six."
2398,2,"He stood on the edge of the pit-bank for a moment, looking out over the fields; grey rain was falling."
2399,2,"The trucks stood full of wet, bright coal."
2400,2,"Water ran down the sides of the waggons, over the white ""C.W."
2401,2,"and Co.""."
2402,2,"Colliers, walking indifferent to the rain, were streaming down the line and up the field, a grey, dismal host."
2403,2,"Morel put up his umbrella, and took pleasure from the peppering of the drops thereon.All along the road to Bestwood the miners tramped, wet and grey and dirty, but their red mouths talking with animation."
2404,2,"Morel also walked with a gang, but he said nothing."
2405,2,He frowned peevishly as he went.
2406,2,Many men passed into the Prince of Wales or into Ellen's.
2407,2,"Morel, feeling sufficiently disagreeable to resist temptation, trudged along under the dripping trees that overhung the park wall, and down the mud of Greenhill Lane.Mrs."
2408,2,"Morel lay in bed, listening to the rain, and the feet of the colliers from Minton, their voices, and the bang, bang of the gates as they went through the stile up the field.""There's some herb beer behind the pantry door,"" she said."
2409,2,"""Th' master'll want a drink, if he doesn't stop.""But he was late, so she concluded he had called for a drink, since it was raining."
2410,2,"What did he care about the child or her?She was very ill when her children were born.""What is it?"" she asked, feeling sick to death.""A boy.""And she took consolation in that."
2411,2,The thought of being the mother of men was warming to her heart.
2412,2,She looked at the child.
2413,2,"It had blue eyes, and a lot of fair hair, and was bonny."
2414,2,"Her love came up hot, in spite of everything."
2415,2,"She had it in bed with her.Morel, thinking nothing, dragged his way up the garden path, wearily and angrily."
2416,2,"He closed his umbrella, and stood it in the sink; then he sluthered his heavy boots into the kitchen."
2417,2,Mrs.
2418,2,"Bower appeared in the inner doorway.""Well,"" she said, ""she's about as bad as she can be."
2419,2,"It's a boy childt.""The miner grunted, put his empty snap-bag and his tin bottle on the dresser, went back into the scullery and hung up his coat, then came and dropped into his chair.""Han yer got a drink?"" he asked.The woman went into the pantry."
2420,2,There was heard the pop of a cork.
2421,2,"She set the mug, with a little, disgusted rap, on the table before Morel."
2422,2,"He drank, gasped, wiped his big moustache on the end of his scarf, drank, gasped, and lay back in his chair."
2423,2,The woman would not speak to him again.
2424,2,"She set his dinner before him, and went upstairs.""Was that the master?"" asked Mrs."
2425,2,"Morel.""I've gave him his dinner,"" replied Mrs."
2426,2,Bower.After he had sat with his arms on the table—he resented the fact that Mrs.
2427,2,"Bower put no cloth on for him, and gave him a little plate, instead of a full-sized dinner-plate—he began to eat."
2428,2,"The fact that his wife was ill, that he had another boy, was nothing to him at that moment."
2429,2,He was too tired; he wanted his dinner; he wanted to sit with his arms lying on the board; he did not like having Mrs.
2430,2,Bower about.
2431,2,"The fire was too small to please him.After he had finished his meal, he sat for twenty minutes; then he stoked up a big fire."
2432,2,"Then, in his stockinged feet, he went reluctantly upstairs."
2433,2,"It was a struggle to face his wife at this moment, and he was tired."
2434,2,"His face was black, and smeared with sweat."
2435,2,"His singlet had dried again, soaking the dirt in."
2436,2,He had a dirty woollen scarf round his throat.
2437,2,"So he stood at the foot of the bed.""Well, how are ter, then?"" he asked.""I s'll be all right,"" she answered.""H'm!""He stood at a loss what to say next."
2438,2,"He was tired, and this bother was rather a nuisance to him, and he didn't quite know where he was.""A lad, tha says,"" he stammered.She turned down the sheet and showed the child.""Bless him!"" he murmured."
2439,2,"Which made her laugh, because he blessed by rote—pretending paternal emotion, which he did not feel just then.""Go now,"" she said.""I will, my lass,"" he answered, turning away.Dismissed, he wanted to kiss her, but he dared not."
2440,2,"She half wanted him to kiss her, but could not bring herself to give any sign."
2441,2,"She only breathed freely when he was gone out of the room again, leaving behind him a faint smell of pit-dirt.Mrs."
2442,2,Morel had a visit every day from the Congregational clergyman.
2443,2,Mr.
2444,2,"Heaton was young, and very poor."
2445,2,"His wife had died at the birth of his first baby, so he remained alone in the manse."
2446,2,"He was a Bachelor of Arts of Cambridge, very shy, and no preacher."
2447,2,Mrs.
2448,2,"Morel was fond of him, and he depended on her."
2449,2,"For hours he talked to her, when she was well."
2450,2,He became the god-parent of the child.Occasionally the minister stayed to tea with Mrs.
2451,2,Morel.
2452,2,"Then she laid the cloth early, got out her best cups, with a little green rim, and hoped Morel would not come too soon; indeed, if he stayed for a pint, she would not mind this day."
2453,2,"She had always two dinners to cook, because she believed children should have their chief meal at midday, whereas Morel needed his at five o'clock."
2454,2,So Mr.
2455,2,"Heaton would hold the baby, whilst Mrs."
2456,2,"Morel beat up a batter-pudding or peeled the potatoes, and he, watching her all the time, would discuss his next sermon."
2457,2,His ideas were quaint and fantastic.
2458,2,She brought him judiciously to earth.
2459,2,"It was a discussion of the wedding at Cana.""When He changed the water into wine at Cana,"" he said, ""that is a symbol that the ordinary life, even the blood, of the married husband and wife, which had before been uninspired, like water, became filled with the Spirit, and was as wine, because, when love enters, the whole spiritual constitution of a man changes, is filled with the Holy Ghost, and almost his form is altered.""Mrs."
2460,2,"Morel thought to herself:""Yes, poor fellow, his young wife is dead; that is why he makes his love into the Holy Ghost.""They were halfway down their first cup of tea when they heard the sluther of pit-boots.""Good gracious!"" exclaimed Mrs."
2461,2,"Morel, in spite of herself.The minister looked rather scared."
2462,2,Morel entered.
2463,2,He was feeling rather savage.
2464,2,"He nodded a ""How d'yer do"" to the clergyman, who rose to shake hands with him.""Nay,"" said Morel, showing his hand, ""look thee at it! Tha niver wants ter shake hands wi' a hand like that, does ter? There's too much pick-haft and shovel-dirt on it.""The minister flushed with confusion, and sat down again."
2465,2,Mrs.
2466,2,"Morel rose, carried out the steaming saucepan."
2467,2,"Morel took off his coat, dragged his armchair to table, and sat down heavily.""Are you tired?"" asked the clergyman.""Tired? I ham that,"" replied Morel."
2468,2,"""YOU don't know what it is to be tired, as I'M tired.""""No,"" replied the clergyman.""Why, look yer 'ere,"" said the miner, showing the shoulders of his singlet."
2469,2,"""It's a bit dry now, but it's wet as a clout with sweat even yet."
2470,2,"Feel it.""""Goodness!"" cried Mrs."
2471,2,Morel.
2472,2,"""Mr."
2473,2,"Heaton doesn't want to feel your nasty singlet.""The clergyman put out his hand gingerly.""No, perhaps he doesn't,"" said Morel; ""but it's all come out of me, whether or not."
2474,2,An' iv'ry day alike my singlet's wringin' wet.
2475,2,"'Aven't you got a drink, Missis, for a man when he comes home barkled up from the pit?""""You know you drank all the beer,"" said Mrs."
2476,2,"Morel, pouring out his tea.""An' was there no more to be got?"" Turning to t."
2477,2,"Ours is essentially a tragic age, so we refuse to take it tragically.The cataclysm has happened, we are among the ruins, we start to buildup new little habitats, to have new little hopes."
2478,2,"It is rather hardwork: there is now no smooth road into the future: but we go round, orscramble over the obstacles."
2479,2,"We've got to live, no matter how manyskies have fallen.This was more or less Constance Chatterley's position."
2480,2,The war hadbrought the roof down over her head.
2481,2,"And she had realized that one mustlive and learn.She married Clifford Chatterley in 1917, when he was home for a monthon leave."
2482,2,They had a month's honeymoon.
2483,2,"Then he went back to Flanders:to be shipped over to England again six months later, more or less inbits."
2484,2,"Constance, his wife, was then twenty-three years old, and he wastwenty-nine.His hold on life was marvellous."
2485,2,"He didn't die, and the bits seemed togrow together again."
2486,2,"For two years he remained in the doctor's hands.Then he was pronounced a cure, and could return to life again, with thelower half of his body, from the hips down, paralysed for ever.This was in 1920."
2487,2,"They returned, Clifford and Constance, to his home,Wragby Hall, the family 'seat'."
2488,2,"His father had died, Clifford was now abaronet, Sir Clifford, and Constance was Lady Chatterley."
2489,2,They came tostart housekeeping and married life in the rather forlorn home of theChatterleys on a rather inadequate income.
2490,2,"Clifford had a sister, butshe had departed."
2491,2,Otherwise there were no near relatives.
2492,2,The elderbrother was dead in the war.
2493,2,"Crippled for ever, knowing he could neverhave any children, Clifford came home to the smoky Midlands to keep theChatterley name alive while he could.He was not really downcast."
2494,2,"He could wheel himself about in a wheeledchair, and he had a bath-chair with a small motor attachment, so hecould drive himself slowly round the garden and into the finemelancholy park, of which he was really so proud, though he pretendedto be flippant about it.Having suffered so much, the capacity for suffering had to some extentleft him."
2495,2,"He remained strange and bright and cheerful, almost, onemight say, chirpy, with his ruddy, healthy-looking face, and hispale-blue, challenging bright eyes."
2496,2,"His shoulders were broad andstrong, his hands were very strong."
2497,2,"He was expensively dressed, andwore handsome neckties from Bond Street."
2498,2,"Yet still in his face one sawthe watchful look, the slight vacancy of a cripple.He had so very nearly lost his life, that what remained was wonderfullyprecious to him."
2499,2,"It was obvious in the anxious brightness of his eyes,how proud he was, after the great shock, of being alive."
2500,2,"But he hadbeen so much hurt that something inside him had perished, some of hisfeelings had gone."
2501,2,"There was a blank of insentience.Constance, his wife, was a ruddy, country-looking girl with soft brownhair and sturdy body, and slow movements, full of unusual energy."
2502,2,"Shehad big, wondering eyes, and a soft mild voice, and seemed just to havecome from her native village."
2503,2,It was not so at all.
2504,2,Her father was theonce well-known R.
2505,2,"A., old Sir Malcolm Reid."
2506,2,"Her mother had been one ofthe cultivated Fabians in the palmy, rather pre-Raphaelite days.Between artists and cultured socialists, Constance and her sister Hildahad had what might be called an aesthetically unconventionalupbringing."
2507,2,"They had been taken to Paris and Florence and Rome tobreathe in art, and they had been taken also in the other direction, tothe Hague and Berlin, to great Socialist conventions, where thespeakers spoke in every civilized tongue, and no one was abashed.The two girls, therefore, were from an early age not the least dauntedby either art or ideal politics."
2508,2,It was their natural atmosphere.
2509,2,"Theywere at once cosmopolitan and provincial, with the cosmopolitanprovincialism of art that goes with pure social ideals.They had been sent to Dresden at the age of fifteen, for music amongother things."
2510,2,And they had had a good time there.
2511,2,"They lived freelyamong the students, they argued with the men over philosophical,sociological and artistic matters, they were just as good as the menthemselves: only better, since they were women."
2512,2,"And they tramped off tothe forests with sturdy youths bearing guitars, twang-twang! They sangthe Wandervogel songs, and they were free."
2513,2,Free! That was the greatword.
2514,2,"Out in the open world, out in the forests of the morning, withlusty and splendid-throated young fellows, free to do as they liked,and--above all--to say what they liked."
2515,2,It was the talk that matteredsupremely: the impassioned interchange of talk.
2516,2,Love was only a minoraccompaniment.Both Hilda and Constance had had their tentative love-affairs by thetime they were eighteen.
2517,2,"The young men with whom they talked sopassionately and sang so lustily and camped under the trees in suchfreedom wanted, of course, the love connexion."
2518,2,"The girls were doubtful,but then the thing was so much talked about, it was supposed to be soimportant."
2519,2,And the men were so humble and craving.
2520,2,"Why couldn't a girlbe queenly, and give the gift of herself?So they had given the gift of themselves, each to the youth with whomshe had the most subtle and intimate arguments."
2521,2,"The arguments, thediscussions were the great thing: the love-making and connexion wereonly a sort of primitive reversion and a bit of an anti-climax."
2522,2,"One wasless in love with the boy afterwards, and a little inclined to hatehim, as if he had trespassed on one's privacy and inner freedom."
2523,2,"For,of course, being a girl, one's whole dignity and meaning in lifeconsisted in the achievement of an absolute, a perfect, a pure andnoble freedom."
2524,2,"What else did a girl's life mean? To shake off the oldand sordid connexions and subjections.And however one might sentimentalize it, this sex business was one ofthe most ancient, sordid connexions and subjections."
2525,2,Poets whoglorified it were mostly men.
2526,2,"Women had always known there wassomething better, something higher."
2527,2,And now they knew it moredefinitely than ever.
2528,2,The beautiful pure freedom of a woman wasinfinitely more wonderful than any sexual love.
2529,2,The only unfortunatething was that men lagged so far behind women in the matter.
2530,2,Theyinsisted on the sex thing like dogs.And a woman had to yield.
2531,2,A man was like a child with his appetites.
2532,2,"Awoman had to yield him what he wanted, or like a child he wouldprobably turn nasty and flounce away and spoil what was a very pleasantconnexion."
2533,2,"But a woman could yield to a man without yielding her inner,free self."
2534,2,That the poets and talkers about sex did not seem to havetaken sufficiently into account.
2535,2,A woman could take a man withoutreally giving herself away.
2536,2,Certainly she could take him without givingherself into his power.
2537,2,Rather she could use this sex thing to havepower over him.
2538,2,"For she only had to hold herself back in sexualintercourse, and let him finish and expend himself without herselfcoming to the crisis: and then she could prolong the connexion andachieve her orgasm and her crisis while he was merely her tool.Both sisters had had their love experience by the time the war came,and they were hurried home."
2539,2,"Neither was ever in love with a young manunless he and she were verbally very near: that is unless they wereprofoundly interested, TALKING to one another."
2540,2,"The amazing, theprofound, the unbelievable thrill there was in passionately talking tosome really clever young man by the hour, resuming day after day formonths...this they had never realized till it happened! The paradisalpromise: Thou shalt have men to talk to!--had never been uttered."
2541,2,"Itwas fulfilled before they knew what a promise it was.And if after the roused intimacy of these vivid and soul-enlighteneddiscussions the sex thing became more or less inevitable, then let it.It marked the end of a chapter."
2542,2,"It had a thrill of its own too: a queervibrating thrill inside the body, a final spasm of self-assertion, likethe last word, exciting, and very like the row of asterisks that can beput to show the end of a paragraph, and a break in the theme.When the girls came home for the summer holidays of 1913, when Hildawas twenty and Connie eighteen, their father could see plainly thatthey had had the love experience.L'amour avait pass頰ar lଠas somebody puts it."
2543,2,"But he was a man ofexperience himself, and let life take its course."
2544,2,"As for the mother, anervous invalid in the last few months of her life, she wanted hergirls to be 'free', and to 'fulfil themselves'."
2545,2,She herself had neverbeen able to be altogether herself: it had been denied her.
2546,2,"Heavenknows why, for she was a woman who had her own income and her own way.She blamed her husband."
2547,2,"But as a matter of fact, it was some oldimpression of authority on her own mind or soul that she could not getrid of."
2548,2,"It had nothing to do with Sir Malcolm, who left his nervouslyhostile, high-spirited wife to rule her own roost, while he went hisown way.So the girls were 'free', and went back to Dresden, and their music,and the university and the young men."
2549,2,"They loved their respective youngmen, and their respective young men loved them with all the passion ofmental attraction."
2550,2,"All the wonderful things the young men thought andexpressed and wrote, they thought and expressed and wrote for the youngwomen."
2551,2,"Connie's young man was musical, Hilda's was technical."
2552,2,But theysimply lived for their young women.
2553,2,"In their minds and their mentalexcitements, that is."
2554,2,"Somewhere else they were a little rebuffed,though they did not know it.It was obvious in them too that love had gone through them: that is,the physical experience."
2555,2,"It is curious what a subtle but unmistakabletransmutation it makes, both in the body of men and women: the womanmore blooming, more subtly rounded, her young angularities softened,and her expression either anxious or triumphant: the man much quieter,more inward, the very shapes of his shoulders and his buttocks lessassertive, more hesitant.In the actual sex-thrill within the body, the sisters nearly succumbedto the strange male power."
2556,2,"But quickly they recovered themselves, tookthe sex-thrill as a sensation, and remained free."
2557,2,"Whereas the men, ingratitude to the woman for the sex experience, let their souls go outto her."
2558,2,And afterwards looked rather as if they had lost a shilling andfound sixpence.
2559,2,"Connie's man could be a bit sulky, and Hilda's a bitjeering."
2560,2,But that is how men are! Ungrateful and never satisfied.
2561,2,"Whenyou don't have them they hate you because you won't; and when you dohave them they hate you again, for some other reason."
2562,2,"Or for no reasonat all, except that they are discontented children, and can't besatisfied whatever they get, let a woman do what she may.However, came the war, Hilda and Connie were rushed home again afterhaving been home already in May, to their mother's funeral."
2563,2,"BeforeChristmas of 1914 both their German young men were dead: whereupon thesisters wept, and loved the young men passionately, but underneathforgot them."
2564,2,"They didn't exist any more.Both sisters lived in their father's, really their mother's Kensingtonhouse, and mixed with the young Cambridge group, the group that stood for'freedom' and flannel trousers, and flannel shirts open at the neck,and a well-bred sort of emotional anarchy, and a whispering, murmuringsort of voice, and an ultra-sensitive sort of manner."
2565,2,"Hilda, however,suddenly married a man ten years older than herself, an elder member ofthe same Cambridge group, a man with a fair amount of money, and acomfortable family job in the government: he also wrote philosophicalessays."
2566,2,"She lived with him in a smallish house in Westminster, andmoved in that good sort of society of people in the government who arenot tip-toppers, but who are, or would be, the real intelligent powerin the nation: people who know what they're talking about, or talk asif they did.Connie did a mild form of war-work, and consorted with theflannel-trousers Cambridge intransigents, who gently mocked ateverything, so far."
2567,2,"Her 'friend' was a Clifford Chatterley, a young manof twenty-two, who had hurried home from Bonn, where he was studyingthe technicalities of coal-mining."
2568,2,He had previously spent two years atCambridge.
2569,2,"Now he had become a first lieutenant in a smart regiment, sohe could mock at everything more becomingly in uniform.Clifford Chatterley was more upper-class than Connie."
2570,2,"Connie waswell-to-do intelligentsia, but he was aristocracy."
2571,2,"Not the big sort,but still it."
2572,2,"His father was a baronet, and his mother had been aviscount's daughter.But Clifford, while he was better bred than Connie, and more 'society',was in his own way more provincial and more timid."
2573,2,"He was at his easein the narrow 'great world', that is, landed aristocracy society, buthe was shy and nervous of all that other big world which consists ofthe vast hordes of the middle and lower classes, and foreigners."
2574,2,"If thetruth must be told, he was just a little bit frightened of middle-andlower-class humanity, and of foreigners not of his own class."
2575,2,"He was,in some paralysing way, conscious of his own defencelessness, though hehad all the defence of privilege."
2576,2,"Which is curious, but a phenomenon ofour day.Therefore the peculiar soft assurance of a girl like Constance Reidfascinated him."
2577,2,She was so much more mistress of herself in that outerworld of chaos than he was master of himself.Nevertheless he too was a rebel: rebelling even against his class.
2578,2,Orperhaps rebel is too strong a word; far too strong.
2579,2,"He was only caughtin the general, popular recoil of the young against convention andagainst any sort of real authority."
2580,2,Fathers were ridiculous: his ownobstinate one supremely so.
2581,2,And governments were ridiculous: our ownwait-and-see sort especially so.
2582,2,"And armies were ridiculous, and oldbuffers of generals altogether, the red-faced Kitchener supremely."
2583,2,"Eventhe war was ridiculous, though it did kill rather a lot of people.In fact everything was a little ridiculous, or very ridiculous:certainly everything connected with authority, whether it were in thearmy or the government or the universities, was ridiculous to a degree.And as far as the governing class made any pretensions to govern, theywere ridiculous too."
2584,2,"Sir Geoffrey, Clifford's father, was intenselyridiculous, chopping down his trees, and weeding men out of hiscolliery to shove them into the war; and himself being so safe andpatriotic; but, also, spending more money on his country than he'd got.When Miss Chatterley--Emma--came down to London from the Midlands to dosome nursing work, she was very witty in a quiet way about Sir Geoffreyand his determined patriotism."
2585,2,"Herbert, the elder brother and heir,laughed outright, though it was his trees that were felling for trenchprops."
2586,2,But Clifford only smiled a little uneasily.
2587,2,"Everything wasridiculous, quite true."
2588,2,"But when it came too close and oneself becameridiculous too...? At least people of a different class, like Connie,were earnest about something."
2589,2,"They believed in something.They were rather earnest about the Tommies, and the threat ofconscription, and the shortage of sugar and toffee for the children."
2590,2,"Inall these things, of course, the authorities were ridiculously atfault."
2591,2,But Clifford could not take it to heart.
2592,2,"To him the authoritieswere ridiculous AB OVO, not because of toffee or Tommies.And the authorities felt ridiculous, and behaved in a rather ridiculousfashion, and it was all a mad hatter's tea-party for a while."
2593,2,"Tillthings developed over there, and Lloyd George came to save thesituation over here."
2594,2,"And this surpassed even ridicule, the flippantyoung laughed no more.In 1916 Herbert Chatterley was killed, so Clifford became heir."
2595,2,He wasterrified even of this.
2596,2,"His importance as son of Sir Geoffrey, andchild of Wragby, was so ingrained in him, he could never escape it."
2597,2,"Andyet he knew that this too, in the eyes of the vast seething world, wasridiculous."
2598,2,Now he was heir and responsible for Wragby.
2599,2,"Was that notterrible? and also splendid and at the same time, perhaps, purelyabsurd?Sir Geoffrey would have none of the absurdity."
2600,2,"He was pale and tense,withdrawn into himself, and obstinately determined to save his countryand his own position, let it be Lloyd George or who it might."
2601,2,"So cutoff he was, so divorced from the England that was really England, soutterly incapable, that he even thought well of Horatio Bottomley."
2602,2,SirGeoffrey stood for England and Lloyd George as his forebears had stoodfor England and St George: and he never knew there was a difference.
2603,2,"SoSir Geoffrey felled timber and stood for Lloyd George and England,England and Lloyd George.And he wanted Clifford to marry and produce an heir."
2604,2,Clifford felt hisfather was a hopeless anachronism.
2605,2,"But wherein was he himself anyfurther ahead, except in a wincing sense of the ridiculousness ofeverything, and the paramount ridiculousness of his own position? Forwilly-nilly he took his baronetcy and Wragby with the last seriousness.The gay excitement had gone out of the war...dead."
2606,2,Too much death andhorror.
2607,2,A man needed support and comfort.
2608,2,A man needed to have ananchor in the safe world.
2609,2,"A man needed a wife.The Chatterleys, two brothers and a sister, had lived curiouslyisolated, shut in with one another at Wragby, in spite of all theirconnexions."
2610,2,"A sense of isolation intensified the family tie, a sense ofthe weakness of their position, a sense of defencelessness, in spiteof, or because of, the title and the land."
2611,2,They were cut off from thoseindustrial Midlands in which they passed their lives.
2612,2,"And they were cutoff from their own class by the brooding, obstinate, shut-up nature ofSir Geoffrey, their father, whom they ridiculed, but whom they were sosensitive about.The three had said they would all live together always."
2613,2,"But now Herbertwas dead, and Sir Geoffrey wanted Clifford to marry."
2614,2,Sir Geoffreybarely mentioned it: he spoke very little.
2615,2,"But his silent, broodinginsistence that it should be so was hard for Clifford to bear upagainst.But Emma said No! She was ten years older than Clifford, and she felthis marrying would be a desertion and a betrayal of what the young onesof the family had stood for.Clifford married Connie, nevertheless, and had his month's honeymoonwith her."
2616,2,"It was the terrible year 1917, and they were intimate as twopeople who stand together on a sinking ship."
2617,2,He had been virgin when hemarried: and the sex part did not mean much to him.
2618,2,"They were so close,he and she, apart from that."
2619,2,"And Connie exulted a little in thisintimacy which was beyond sex, and beyond a man's 'satisfaction'.Clifford anyhow was not just keen on his 'satisfaction', as so many menseemed to be."
2620,2,"No, the intimacy was deeper, more personal than that."
2621,2,"Andsex was merely an accident, or an adjunct, one of the curious obsolete,organic processes which persisted in its own clumsiness, but was notreally necessary."
2622,2,"Though Connie did want children: if only to fortifyher against her sister-in-law Emma.But early in 1918 Clifford was shipped home smashed, and there was nochild."
2623,2,And Sir Geoffrey died of chagrin.Chapter 2Connie and Clifford came home to Wragby in the autumn of 1920.
2624,2,"MissChatterley, still disgusted at her brother's defection, had departedand was living in a little flat in London.Wragby was a long low old house in brown stone, begun about the middleof the eighteenth century, and added on to, till it was a warren of aplace without much distinction."
2625,2,"It stood on an eminence in a ratherfine old park of oak trees, but alas, one could see in the neardistance the chimney of Tevershall pit, with its clouds of steam andsmoke, and on the damp, hazy distance of the hill the raw straggle ofTevershall village, a village which began almost at the park gates, andtrailed in utter hopeless ugliness for a long and gruesome mile:houses, rows of wretched, small, begrimed, brick houses, with blackslate roofs for lids, sharp angles and wilful, blank dreariness.Connie was accustomed to Kensington or the Scotch hills or the Sussexdowns: that was her England."
2626,2,"With the stoicism of the young she took inthe utter, soulless ugliness of the coal-and-iron Midlands at a glance,and left it at what it was: unbelievable and not to be thought about.From the rather dismal rooms at Wragby she heard the rattle-rattle ofthe screens at the pit, the puff of the winding-engine, the clink-clinkof shunting trucks, and the hoarse little whistle of the collierylocomotives."
2627,2,"Tevershall pit-bank was burning, had been burning foryears, and it would cost thousands to put it out."
2628,2,"So it had to burn.And when the wind was that way, which was often, the house was full ofthe stench of this sulphurous combustion of the earth's excrement."
2629,2,"Buteven on windless days the air always smelt of something under-earth:sulphur, iron, coal, or acid."
2630,2,"And even on the Christmas roses the smutssettled persistently, incredible, like black manna from the skies ofdoom.Well, there it was: fated like the rest of things! It was rather awful,but why kick? You couldn't kick it away."
2631,2,It just went on.
2632,2,"Life, likeall the rest! On the low dark ceiling of cloud at night red blotchesburned and quavered, dappling and swelling and contracting, like burnsthat give pain."
2633,2,It was the furnaces.
2634,2,At first they fascinated Conniewith a sort of horror; she felt she was living underground.
2635,2,Then shegot used to them.
2636,2,And in the morning it rained.Clifford professed to like Wragby better than London.
2637,2,"This country hada grim will of its own, and the people had guts."
2638,2,Connie wondered whatelse they had: certainly neither eyes nor minds.
2639,2,"The people were ashaggard, shapeless, and dreary as the countryside, and as unfriendly.Only there was something in their deep-mouthed slurring of the dialect,and the thresh-thresh of their hob-nailed pit-boots as they trailedhome in gangs on the asphalt from work, that was terrible and a bitmysterious.There had been no welcome home for the young squire, no festivities, nodeputation, not even a single flower."
2640,2,"Only a dank ride in a motor-carup a dark, damp drive, burrowing through gloomy trees, out to the slopeof the park where grey damp sheep were feeding, to the knoll where thehouse spread its dark brown facade, and the housekeeper and her husbandwere hovering, like unsure tenants on the face of the earth, ready tostammer a welcome.There was no communication between Wragby Hall and Tevershall village,none."
2641,2,"No caps were touched, no curtseys bobbed."
2642,2,"The colliers merelystared; the tradesmen lifted their caps to Connie as to anacquaintance, and nodded awkwardly to Clifford; that was all."
2643,2,"Gulfimpassable, and a quiet sort of resentment on either side."
2644,2,At firstConnie suffered from the steady drizzle of resentment that came fromthe village.
2645,2,"Then she hardened herself to it, and it became a sort oftonic, something to live up to."
2646,2,"It was not that she and Clifford wereunpopular, they merely belonged to another species altogether from thecolliers."
2647,2,"Gulf impassable, breach indescribable, such as is perhapsnonexistent south of the Trent."
2648,2,"But in the Midlands and the industrialNorth gulf impassable, across which no communication could take place.You stick to your side, I'll stick to mine! A strange denial of thecommon pulse of humanity.Yet the village sympathized with Clifford and Connie in the abstract.In the flesh it was--You leave me alone!--on either side.The rector was a nice man of about sixty, full of his duty, andreduced, personally, almost to a nonentity by the silent--You leave mealone!--of the village."
2649,2,The miners' wives were nearly all Methodists.The miners were nothing.
2650,2,But even so much official uniform as theclergyman wore was enough to obscure entirely the fact that he was aman like any other man.
2651,2,"No, he was Mester Ashby, a sort of automaticpreaching and praying concern.This stubborn, instinctive--We think ourselves as good as you, if youARE Lady Chatterley!--puzzled and baffled Connie at first extremely.The curious, suspicious, false amiability with which the miners' wivesmet her overtures; the curiously offensive tinge of--Oh dear me! I AMsomebody now, with Lady Chatterley talking to me! But she needn't thinkI'm not as good as her for all that!--which she always heard twangingin the women's half-fawning voices, was impossible."
2652,2,There was nogetting past it.
2653,2,"It was hopelessly and offensively nonconformist.Clifford left them alone, and she learnt to do the same: she just wentby without looking at them, and they stared as if she were a walkingwax figure."
2654,2,"When he had to deal with them, Clifford was rather haughtyand contemptuous; one could no longer afford to be friendly."
2655,2,In fact hewas altogether rather supercilious and contemptuous of anyone not inhis own class.
2656,2,"He stood his ground, without any attempt atconciliation."
2657,2,"And he was neither liked nor disliked by the people: hewas just part of things, like the pit-bank and Wragby itself.But Clifford was really extremely shy and self-conscious now he waslamed."
2658,2,He hated seeing anyone except just the personal servants.
2659,2,For hehad to sit in a wheeled chair or a sort of bath-chair.
2660,2,"Nevertheless hewas just as carefully dressed as ever, by his expensive tailors, and hewore the careful Bond Street neckties just as before, and from the tophe looked just as smart and impressive as ever."
2661,2,"He had never been oneof the modern ladylike young men: rather bucolic even, with his ruddyface and broad shoulders."
2662,2,"But his very quiet, hesitating voice, and hiseyes, at the same time bold and frightened, assured and uncertain,revealed his nature."
2663,2,"His manner was often offensively supercilious, andthen again modest and self-effacing, almost tremulous.Connie and he were attached to one another, in the aloof modern way."
2664,2,"Hewas much too hurt in himself, the great shock of his maiming, to beeasy and flippant."
2665,2,He was a hurt thing.
2666,2,And as such Connie stuck to himpassionately.But she could not help feeling how little connexion he really had withpeople.
2667,2,"The miners were, in a sense, his own men; but he saw them asobjects rather than men, parts of the pit rather than parts of life,crude raw phenomena rather than human beings along with him."
2668,2,"He was insome way afraid of them, he could not bear to have them look at him nowhe was lame."
2669,2,"And their queer, crude life seemed as unnatural as that ofhedgehogs.He was remotely interested; but like a man looking down a microscope,or up a telescope."
2670,2,He was not in touch.
2671,2,"He was not in actual touch withanybody, save, traditionally, with Wragby, and, through the close bondof family defence, with Emma."
2672,2,"Beyond this nothing really touched him.Connie felt that she herself didn't really, not really touch him;perhaps there was nothing to get at ultimately; just a negation ofhuman contact.Yet he was absolutely dependent on her, he needed her every moment."
2673,2,"Bigand strong as he was, he was helpless."
2674,2,"He could wheel himself about ina wheeled chair, and he had a sort of bath-chair with a motorattachment, in which he could puff slowly round the park."
2675,2,But alone hewas like a lost thing.
2676,2,"He needed Connie to be there, to assure him heexisted at all.Still he was ambitious."
2677,2,"He had taken to writing stories; curious, verypersonal stories about people he had known."
2678,2,"Clever, rather spiteful,and yet, in some mysterious way, meaningless."
2679,2,The observation wasextraordinary and peculiar.
2680,2,"But there was no touch, no actual contact.It was as if the whole thing took place in a vacuum."
2681,2,"And since thefield of life is largely an artificially-lighted stage today, thestories were curiously true to modern life, to the modern psychology,that is.Clifford was almost morbidly sensitive about these stories."
2682,2,"He wantedeveryone to think them good, of the best, NE PLUS ULTRA."
2683,2,"They appearedin the most modern magazines, and were praised and blamed as usual."
2684,2,"Butto Clifford the blame was torture, like knives goading him."
2685,2,It was asif the whole of his being were in his stories.Connie helped him as much as she could.
2686,2,At first she was thrilled.
2687,2,"Hetalked everything over with her monotonously, insistently,persistently, and she had to respond with all her might."
2688,2,It was as ifher whole soul and body and sex had to rouse up and pass into themestories of his.
2689,2,This thrilled her and absorbed her.Of physical life they lived very little.
2690,2,She had to superintend thehouse.
2691,2,"But the housekeeper had served Sir Geoffrey for many years, andthe dried-up, elderly, superlatively correct female you could hardlycall her a parlour-maid, or even a woman...who waited at table, hadbeen in the house for forty years."
2692,2,Even the very housemaids were nolonger young.
2693,2,"It was awful! What could you do with such a place, butleave it alone! All these endless rooms that nobody used, all theMidlands routine, the mechanical cleanliness and the mechanical order!Clifford had insisted on a new cook, an experienced woman who hadserved him in his rooms in London."
2694,2,For the rest the place seemed run bymechanical anarchy.
2695,2,"Everything went on in pretty good order, strictcleanliness, and strict punctuality; even pretty strict honesty."
2696,2,"Andyet, to Connie, it was a methodical anarchy."
2697,2,No warmth of feelingunited it organically.
2698,2,The house seemed as dreary as a disused street.What could she do but leave it alone? So she left it alone.
2699,2,"MissChatterley came sometimes, with her aristocratic thin face, andtriumphed, finding nothing altered."
2700,2,She would never forgive Connie forousting her from her union in consciousness with her brother.
2701,2,"It wasshe, Emma, who should be bringing forth the stories, these books, withhim; the Chatterley stories, something new in the world, that THEY, theChatterleys, had put there."
2702,2,There was no other standard.
2703,2,"There was noorganic connexion with the thought and expression that had gone before.Only something new in the world: the Chatterley books, entirelypersonal.Connie's father, where he paid a flying visit to Wragby, and in privateto his daughter: As for Clifford's writing, it's smart, but there'sNOTHING IN IT."
2704,2,"It won't last! Connie looked at the burly Scottishknight who had done himself well all his life, and her eyes, her big,still-wondering blue eyes became vague."
2705,2,"Nothing in it! What did he meanby nothing in it? If the critics praised it, and Clifford's name wasalmost famous, and it even brought in money...what did her father meanby saying there was nothing in Clifford's writing? What else couldthere be?For Connie had adopted the standard of the young: what there was in themoment was everything."
2706,2,"And moments followed one another withoutnecessarily belonging to one another.It was in her second winter at Wragby her father said to her: 'I hope,Connie, you won't let circumstances force you into being ademi-vierge.''A demi-vierge!' replied Connie vaguely."
2707,2,"'Why? Why not?''Unless you like it, of course!' said her father hastily."
2708,2,"To Cliffordhe said the same, when the two men were alone: 'I'm afraid it doesn'tquite suit Connie to be a demi-vierge.''A half-virgin!' replied Clifford, translating the phrase to be sure of it.He thought for a moment, then flushed very red."
2709,2,He was angry andoffended.'In what way doesn't it suit her?' he asked stiffly.'She's getting thin...angular.
2710,2,It's not her style.
2711,2,"She's not thepilchard sort of little slip of a girl, she's a bonny Scotch trout.''Without the spots, of course!' said Clifford.He wanted to say something later to Connie about the demi-viergebusiness...the half-virgin state of her affairs."
2712,2,But he could not bringhimself to do it.
2713,2,He was at once too intimate with her and not intimateenough.
2714,2,"He was so very much at one with her, in his mind and hers, butbodily they were non-existent to one another, and neither could bear todrag in the corpus delicti."
2715,2,"They were so intimate, and utterly out oftouch.Connie guessed, however, that her father had said something, and thatsomething was in Clifford's mind."
2716,2,"She knew that he didn't mind whethershe were demi-vierge or demi-monde, so long as he didn't absolutelyknow, and wasn't made to see."
2717,2,"What the eye doesn't see and the minddoesn't know, doesn't exist.Connie and Clifford had now been nearly two years at Wragby, livingtheir vague life of absorption in Clifford and his work."
2718,2,Theirinterests had never ceased to flow together over his work.
2719,2,"They talkedand wrestled in the throes of composition, and felt as if somethingwere happening, really happening, really in the void.And thus far it was a life: in the void."
2720,2,For the rest it wasnon-existence.
2721,2,"Wragby was there, the servants...but spectral, notreally existing."
2722,2,"Connie went for walks in the park, and in the woodsthat joined the park, and enjoyed the solitude and the mystery, kickingthe brown leaves of autumn, and picking the primroses of spring."
2723,2,But itwas all a dream; or rather it was like the simulacrum of reality.
2724,2,"Theoak-leaves were to her like oak-leaves seen ruffling in a mirror, sheherself was a figure somebody had read about, picking primroses thatwere only shadows or memories, or words."
2725,2,"No substance to her oranything...no touch, no contact! Only this life with Clifford, thisendless spinning of webs of yarn, of the minutiae of consciousness,these stories Sir Malcolm said there was nothing in, and they wouldn'tlast."
2726,2,"Why should there be anything in them, why should they last?Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."
2727,2,"Sufficient unto the momentis the APPEARANCE of reality.Clifford had quite a number of friends, acquaintances really, and heinvited them to Wragby."
2728,2,"He invited all sorts of people, critics andwriters, people who would help to praise his books."
2729,2,"And they wereflattered at being asked to Wragby, and they praised."
2730,2,Connie understoodit all perfectly.
2731,2,But why not? This was one of the fleeting patterns inthe mirror.
2732,2,What was wrong with it?She was hostess to these people...mostly men.
2733,2,She was hostess also toClifford's occasional aristocratic relations.
2734,2,"Being a soft, ruddy,country-looking girl, inclined to freckles, with big blue eyes, andcurling, brown hair, and a soft voice, and rather strong, female loinsshe was considered a little old-fashioned and 'womanly'."
2735,2,"She was not a'little pilchard sort of fish', like a boy, with a boy's flat breastand little buttocks."
2736,2,"She was too feminine to be quite smart.So the men, especially those no longer young, were very nice to herindeed."
2737,2,"But, knowing what torture poor Clifford would feel at theslightest sign of flirting on her part, she gave them no encouragementat all."
2738,2,"She was quiet and vague, she had no contact with them andintended to have none."
2739,2,Clifford was extraordinarily proud of himself.His relatives treated her quite kindly.
2740,2,"She knew that the kindlinessindicated a lack of fear, and that these people had no respect for youunless you could frighten them a little."
2741,2,"But again she had no contact.She let them be kindly and disdainful, she let them feel they had noneed to draw their steel in readiness."
2742,2,She had no real connexion withthem.Time went on.
2743,2,"Whatever happened, nothing happened, because she was sobeautifully out of contact."
2744,2,She and Clifford lived in their ideas andhis books.
2745,2,"She entertained...there were always people in the house.Time went on as the clock does, half past eight instead of half pastseven.Chapter 3Connie was aware, however, of a growing restlessness."
2746,2,"Out of herdisconnexion, a restlessness was taking possession of her like madness.It twitched her limbs when she didn't want to twitch them, it jerkedher spine when she didn't want to jerk upright but preferred to restcomfortably."
2747,2,"It thrilled inside her body, in her womb, somewhere, tillshe felt she must jump into water and swim to get away from it; a madrestlessness."
2748,2,It made her heart beat violently for no reason.
2749,2,And shewas getting thinner.It was just restlessness.
2750,2,"She would rush off across the park, abandonClifford, and lie prone in the bracken."
2751,2,To get away from thehouse...she must get away from the house and everybody.
2752,2,"The work washer one refuge, her sanctuary.But it was not really a refuge, a sanctuary, because she had noconnexion with it."
2753,2,It was only a place where she could get away fromthe rest.
2754,2,She never really touched the spirit of the wood itself...ifit had any such nonsensical thing.Vaguely she knew herself that she was going to pieces in some way.Vaguely she knew she was out of connexion: she had lost touch with thesubstantial and vital world.
2755,2,"Only Clifford and his books, which did notexist...which had nothing in them! Void to void."
2756,2,Vaguely she knew.
2757,2,"Butit was like beating her head against a stone.Her father warned her again: 'Why don't you get yourself a beau,Connie? Do you all the good in the world.'That winter Michaelis came for a few days."
2758,2,He was a young Irishman whohad already made a large fortune by his plays in America.
2759,2,"He had beentaken up quite enthusiastically for a time by smart society in London,for he wrote smart society plays."
2760,2,"Then gradually smart society realizedthat it had been made ridiculous at the hands of a down-at-heel Dublinstreet-rat, and revulsion came."
2761,2,Michaelis was the last word in what wascaddish and bounderish.
2762,2,"He was discovered to be anti-English, and tothe class that made this discovery this was worse than the dirtiestcrime."
2763,2,"He was cut dead, and his corpse thrown into the refuse can.Nevertheless Michaelis had his apartment in Mayfair, and walked downBond Street the image of a gentleman, for you cannot get even the besttailors to cut their low-down customers, when the customers pay.Clifford was inviting the young man of thirty at an inauspicious momentin that young man's career."
2764,2,Yet Clifford did not hesitate.
2765,2,"Michaelis hadthe ear of a few million people, probably; and, being a hopelessoutsider, he would no doubt be grateful to be asked down to Wragby atthis juncture, when the rest of the smart world was cutting him."
2766,2,"Beinggrateful, he would no doubt do Clifford 'good' over there in America.Kudos! A man gets a lot of kudos, whatever that may be, by being talkedabout in the right way, especially 'over there'."
2767,2,Clifford was a comingman; and it was remarkable what a sound publicity instinct he had.
2768,2,"Inthe end Michaelis did him most nobly in a play, and Clifford was a sortof popular hero."
2769,2,"Till the reaction, when he found he had been maderidiculous.Connie wondered a little over Clifford's blind, imperious instinct tobecome known: known, that is, to the vast amorphous world he did nothimself know, and of which he was uneasily afraid; known as a writer,as a first-class modern writer."
2770,2,"Connie was aware from successful, old,hearty, bluffing Sir Malcolm, that artists did advertise themselves,and exert themselves to put their goods over."
2771,2,"But her father usedchannels ready-made, used by all the other R."
2772,2,A.s who sold theirpictures.
2773,2,"Whereas Clifford discovered new channels of publicity, allkinds."
2774,2,"He had all kinds of people at Wragby, without exactly loweringhimself."
2775,2,"But, determined to build himself a monument of a reputationquickly, he used any handy rubble in the making.Michaelis arrived duly, in a very neat car, with a chauffeur and amanservant."
2776,2,He was absolutely Bond Street! But at sight of himsomething in Clifford's county soul recoiled.
2777,2,He wasn't exactly...
2778,2,"notexactly...in fact, he wasn't at all, well, what his appearance intendedto imply."
2779,2,To Clifford this was final and enough.
2780,2,Yet he was very politeto the man; to the amazing success in him.
2781,2,"The bitch-goddess, as she iscalled, of Success, roamed, snarling and protective, round thehalf-humble, half-defiant Michaelis' heels, and intimidated Cliffordcompletely: for he wanted to prostitute himself to the bitch-goddess,Success also, if only she would have him.Michaelis obviously wasn't an Englishman, in spite of all the tailors,hatters, barbers, booters of the very best quarter of London."
2782,2,"No, no,he obviously wasn't an Englishman: the wrong sort of flattish, paleface and bearing; and the wrong sort of grievance."
2783,2,"He had a grudge anda grievance: that was obvious to any true-born English gentleman, whowould scorn to let such a thing appear blatant in his own demeanour.Poor Michaelis had been much kicked, so that he had a slightlytail-between-the-legs look even now."
2784,2,"He had pushed his way by sheerinstinct and sheerer effrontery on to the stage and to the front of it,with his plays."
2785,2,He had caught the public.
2786,2,And he had thought thekicking days were over.
2787,2,"Alas, they weren't..."
2788,2,They never would be.
2789,2,"Forhe, in a sense, asked to be kicked."
2790,2,He pined to be where he didn'tbelong...among the English upper classes.
2791,2,"And how they enjoyed thevarious kicks they got at him! And how he hated them!Nevertheless he travelled with his manservant and his very neat car,this Dublin mongrel.There was something about him that Connie liked."
2792,2,"He didn't put on airsto himself, he had no illusions about himself."
2793,2,"He talked to Cliffordsensibly, briefly, practically, about all the things Clifford wanted toknow."
2794,2,He didn't expand or let himself go.
2795,2,"He knew he had been askeddown to Wragby to be made use of, and like an old, shrewd, almostindifferent business man, or big-business man, he let himself be askedquestions, and he answered with as little waste of feeling as possible.'Money!' he said."
2796,2,'Money is a sort of instinct.
2797,2,It's a sort of propertyof nature in a man to make money.
2798,2,It's nothing you do.
2799,2,It's no trickyou play.
2800,2,"It's a sort of permanent accident of your own nature; onceyou start, you make money, and you go on; up to a point, I suppose.''But you've got to begin,' said Clifford.'Oh, quite! You've got to get IN."
2801,2,You can do nothing if you are keptoutside.
2802,2,You've got to beat your way in.
2803,2,"Once you've done that, youcan't help it.''But could you have made money except by plays?' asked Clifford.'Oh, probably not! I may be a good writer or I may be a bad one, but awriter and a writer of plays is what I am, and I've got to be."
2804,2,"There'sno question of that.''And you think it's a writer of popular plays that you've got to be?'asked Connie.'There, exactly!' he said, turning to her in a sudden flash."
2805,2,'There'snothing in it! There's nothing in popularity.
2806,2,"There's nothing in thepublic, if it comes to that."
2807,2,There's nothing really in my plays to makethem popular.
2808,2,It's not that.
2809,2,"They just are like the weather...the sortthat will HAVE to be...for the time being.'He turned his slow, rather full eyes, that had been drowned in suchfathomless disillusion, on Connie, and she trembled a little."
2810,2,"He seemedso old...endlessly old, built up of layers of disillusion, going downin him generation after generation, like geological strata; and at thesame time he was forlorn like a child."
2811,2,"An outcast, in a certain sense;but with the desperate bravery of his rat-like existence.'At least it's wonderful what you've done at your time of life,' saidClifford contemplatively.'I'm thirty...yes, I'm thirty!' said Michaelis, sharply and suddenly,with a curious laugh; hollow, triumphant, and bitter.'And are you alone?' asked Connie.'How do you mean? Do I live alone? I've got my servant."
2812,2,"He's a Greek,so he says, and quite incompetent."
2813,2,But I keep him.
2814,2,And I'm going tomarry.
2815,2,"Oh, yes, I must marry.''It sounds like going to have your tonsils cut,' laughed Connie."
2816,2,'Willit be an effort?'He looked at her admiringly.
2817,2,"'Well, Lady Chatterley, somehow it will! Ifind..."
2818,2,excuse me...
2819,2,"I find I can't marry an Englishwoman, not even anIrishwoman...''Try an American,' said Clifford.'Oh, American!' He laughed a hollow laugh."
2820,2,"'No, I've asked my man if hewill find me a Turk or something...something nearer to the Oriental.'Connie really wondered at this queer, melancholy specimen ofextraordinary success; it was said he had an income of fifty thousanddollars from America alone."
2821,2,"Sometimes he was handsome: sometimes as helooked sideways, downwards, and the light fell on him, he had thesilent, enduring beauty of a carved ivory Negro mask, with his ratherfull eyes, and the strong queerly-arched brows, the immobile,compressed mouth; that momentary but revealed immobility, animmobility, a timelessness which the Buddha aims at, and which Negroesexpress sometimes without ever aiming at it; something old, old, andacquiescent in the race! Aeons of acquiescence in race destiny, insteadof our individual resistance."
2822,2,"And then a swimming through, like rats ina dark river."
2823,2,"Connie felt a sudden, strange leap of sympathy for him, aleap mingled with compassion, and tinged with repulsion, amountingalmost to love."
2824,2,The outsider! The outsider! And they called him abounder! How much more bounderish and assertive Clifford looked! Howmuch stupider!Michaelis knew at once he had made an impression on her.
2825,2,"He turned hisfull, hazel, slightly prominent eyes on her in a look of puredetachment."
2826,2,"He was estimating her, and the extent of the impression hehad made."
2827,2,"With the English nothing could save him from being theeternal outsider, not even love."
2828,2,Yet women sometimes fell forhim...Englishwomen too.He knew just where he was with Clifford.
2829,2,"They were two alien dogs whichwould have liked to snarl at one another, but which smiled instead,perforce."
2830,2,"But with the woman he was not quite so sure.Breakfast was served in the bedrooms; Clifford never appeared beforelunch, and the dining-room was a little dreary."
2831,2,"After coffee Michaelis,restless and ill-sitting soul, wondered what he should do."
2832,2,It was afine November day; fine for Wragby.
2833,2,He looked over the melancholypark.
2834,2,"My God! What a place!He sent a servant to ask, could he be of any service to LadyChatterley: he thought of driving into Sheffield."
2835,2,"The answer came,would he care to go up to Lady Chatterley's sitting-room.Connie had a sitting-room on the third floor, the top floor of thecentral portion of the house."
2836,2,"Clifford's rooms were on the groundfloor, of course."
2837,2,Michaelis was flattered by being asked up to LadyChatterley's own parlour.
2838,2,"He followed blindly after the servant...henever noticed things, or had contact with his surroundings."
2839,2,"In herroom he did glance vaguely round at the fine German reproductions ofRenoir and Cezanne.'It's very pleasant up here,' he said, with his queer smile, as if ithurt him to smile, showing his teeth."
2840,2,"'You are wise to get up to thetop.''Yes, I think so,' she said.Her room was the only gay, modern one in the house, the only spot inWragby where her personality was at all revealed."
2841,2,"Clifford had neverseen it, and she asked very few people up.Now she and Michaelis sit on opposite sides of the fire and talked."
2842,2,"Sheasked him about himself, his mother and father, his brothers...otherpeople were always something of a wonder to her, and when her sympathywas awakened she was quite devoid of class feeling."
2843,2,"Michaelis talkedfrankly about himself, quite frankly, without affectation, simplyrevealing his bitter, indifferent, stray-dog's soul, then showing agleam of revengeful pride in his success.'But why are you such a lonely bird?' Connie asked him; and again helooked at her, with his full, searching, hazel look.'Some birds ARE that way,' he replied."
2844,2,"Then, with a touch of familiarirony: 'but, look here, what about yourself? Aren't you by way of beinga lonely bird yourself?' Connie, a little startled, thought about itfor a few moments, and then she said: 'Only in a way! Not altogether,like you!''Am I altogether a lonely bird?' he asked, with his queer grin of asmile, as if he had toothache; it was so wry, and his eyes were soperfectly unchangingly melancholy, or stoical, or disillusioned orafraid.'Why?' she said, a little breathless, as she looked at him."
2845,2,"'You are,aren't you?'She felt a terrible appeal coming to her from him, that made her almostlose her balance.'Oh, you're quite right!' he said, turning his head away, and lookingsideways, downwards, with that strange immobility of an old race thatis hardly here in our present day."
2846,2,"It was that that really made Connielose her power to see him detached from herself.He looked up at her with the full glance that saw everything,registered everything."
2847,2,"At the same time, the infant crying in the nightwas crying out of his breast to her, in a way that affected her verywomb.'It's awfully nice of you to think of me,' he said laconically.'Why shouldn't I think of you?' she exclaimed, with hardly breath toutter it.He gave the wry, quick hiss of a laugh.'Oh, in that way!...May I hold your hand for a minute?' he askedsuddenly, fixing his eyes on her with almost hypnotic power, andsending out an appeal that affected her direct in the womb.She stared at him, dazed and transfixed, and he went over and kneeledbeside her, and took her two feet close in his two hands, and buriedhis face in her lap, remaining motionless."
2848,2,"She was perfectly dim anddazed, looking down in a sort of amazement at the rather tender nape ofhis neck, feeling his face pressing her thighs."
2849,2,"In all her burningdismay, she could not help putting her hand, with tenderness andcompassion, on the defenceless nape of his neck, and he trembled, witha deep shudder.Then he looked up at her with that awful appeal in his full, glowingeyes."
2850,2,She was utterly incapable of resisting it.
2851,2,"From her breast flowedthe answering, immense yearning over him; she must give him anything,anything.He was a curious and very gentle lover, very gentle with the woman,trembling uncontrollably, and yet at the same time detached, aware,aware of every sound outside.To her it meant nothing except that she gave herself to him."
2852,2,"And atlength he ceased to quiver any more, and lay quite still, quite still.Then, with dim, compassionate fingers, she stroked his head, that layon her breast.When he rose, he kissed both her hands, then both her feet, in theirsuede slippers, and in silence went away to the end of the room, wherehe stood with his back to her."
2853,2,There was silence for some minutes.
2854,2,"Thenhe turned and came to her again as she sat in her old place by thefire.'And now, I suppose you'll hate me!' he said in a quiet, inevitableway."
2855,2,"She looked up at him quickly.'Why should I?' she asked.'They mostly do,' he said; then he caught himself up."
2856,2,"'I mean...a womanis supposed to.''This is the last moment when I ought to hate you,' she saidresentfully.'I know! I know! It should be so! You're FRIGHTFULLY good to me...' hecried miserably.She wondered why he should be miserable."
2857,2,'Won't you sit down again?'she said.
2858,2,"He glanced at the door.'Sir Clifford!' he said, 'won't he...won't he be...?' She paused amoment to consider."
2859,2,'Perhaps!' she said.
2860,2,And she looked up at him.
2861,2,'Idon't want Clifford to know not even to suspect.
2862,2,It WOULD hurt him somuch.
2863,2,"But I don't think it's wrong, do you?''Wrong! Good God, no! You're only too infinitely good to me...I canhardly bear it.'He turned aside, and she saw that in another moment he would besobbing.'But we needn't let Clifford know, need we?' she pleaded."
2864,2,'It wouldhurt him so.
2865,2,"And if he never knows, never suspects, it hurts nobody.''Me!' he said, almost fiercely; 'he'll know nothing from me! You see ifhe does."
2866,2,"Me give myself away! Ha! Ha!' he laughed hollowly, cynically,at such an idea."
2867,2,She watched him in wonder.
2868,2,"He said to her: 'May I kissyour hand and go? I'll run into Sheffield I think, and lunch there, ifI may, and be back to tea."
2869,2,"May I do anything for you? May I be sure youdon't hate me?--and that you won't?'--he ended with a desperate note ofcynicism.'No, I don't hate you,' she said."
2870,2,"'I think you're nice.''Ah!' he said to her fiercely, 'I'd rather you said that to me thansaid you love me! It means such a lot more...Till afternoon then."
2871,2,"I'veplenty to think about till then.' He kissed her hands humbly and wasgone.'I don't think I can stand that young man,' said Clifford at lunch.'Why?' asked Connie.'He's such a bounder underneath his veneer...just waiting to bounceus.''I think people have been so unkind to him,' said Connie.'Do you wonder? And do you think he employs his shining hours doingdeeds of kindness?''I think he has a certain sort of generosity.''Towards whom?''I don't quite know.''Naturally you don't."
2872,2,I'm afraid you mistake unscrupulousness forgenerosity.'Connie paused.
2873,2,Did she? It was just possible.
2874,2,Yet the unscrupulousnessof Michaelis had a certain fascination for her.
2875,2,He went whole lengthswhere Clifford only crept a few timid paces.
2876,2,"In his way he hadconquered the world, which was what Clifford wanted to do."
2877,2,"Ways andmeans...? Were those of Michaelis more despicable than those ofClifford? Was the way the poor outsider had shoved and bounced himselfforward in person, and by the back doors, any worse than Clifford's wayof advertising himself into prominence? The bitch-goddess, Success, wastrailed by thousands of gasping dogs with lolling tongues."
2878,2,"The onethat got her first was the real dog among dogs, if you go by success!So Michaelis could keep his tail up.The queer thing was, he didn't."
2879,2,"He came back towards tea-time with alarge handful of violets and lilies, and the same hang-dog expression.Connie wondered sometimes if it were a sort of mask to disarmopposition, because it was almost too fixed."
2880,2,"Was he really such a saddog?His sad-dog sort of extinguished self persisted all the evening, thoughthrough it Clifford felt the inner effrontery."
2881,2,"Connie didn't feel it,perhaps because it was not directed against women; only against men,and their presumptions and assumptions."
2882,2,"That indestructible, inwardeffrontery in the meagre fellow was what made men so down on Michaelis.His very presence was an affront to a man of society, cloak it as hemight in an assumed good manner.Connie was in love with him, but she managed to sit with her embroideryand let the men talk, and not give herself away."
2883,2,"As for Michaelis, hewas perfect; exactly the same melancholic, attentive, aloof youngfellow of the previous evening, millions of degrees remote from hishosts, but laconically playing up to them to the required amount, andnever coming forth to them for a moment."
2884,2,Connie felt he must haveforgotten the morning.
2885,2,He had not forgotten.
2886,2,"But he knew where hewas...in the same old place outside, where the born outsiders are."
2887,2,Hedidn't take the love-making altogether personally.
2888,2,"He knew it would notchange him from an ownerless dog, whom everybody begrudges its goldencollar, into a comfortable society dog.The final fact being that at the very bottom of his soul he WAS anoutsider, and anti-social, and he accepted the fact inwardly, no matterhow Bond-Streety he was on the outside."
2889,2,"His isolation was a necessityto him; just as the appearance of conformity and mixing-in with thesmart people was also a necessity.But occasional love, as a comfort and soothing, was also a good thing,and he was not ungrateful."
2890,2,"On the contrary, he was burningly,poignantly grateful for a piece of natural, spontaneous kindness:almost to tears."
2891,2,"Beneath his pale, immobile, disillusioned face, hischild's soul was sobbing with gratitude to the woman, and burning tocome to her again; just as his outcast soul was knowing he would keepreally clear of her.He found an opportunity to say to her, as they were lighting thecandles in the hall:'May I come?''I'll come to you,' she said.'Oh, good!'He waited for her a long time...but she came.He was the trembling excited sort of lover, whose crisis soon came, andwas finished."
2892,2,There was something curiously childlike and defencelessabout his naked body: as children are naked.
2893,2,"His defences were all inhis wits and cunning, his very instincts of cunning, and when thesewere in abeyance he seemed doubly naked and like a child, ofunfinished, tender flesh, and somehow struggling helplessly.He roused in the woman a wild sort of compassion and yearning, and awild, craving physical desire."
2894,2,"The physical desire he did not satisfyin her; he was always come and finished so quickly, then shrinking downon her breast, and recovering somewhat his effrontery while she laydazed, disappointed, lost.But then she soon learnt to hold him, to keep him there inside her whenhis crisis was over."
2895,2,"And there he was generous and curiously potent; hestayed firm inside her, giving to her, while she was active...wildly,passionately active, coming to her own crisis."
2896,2,"And as he felt thefrenzy of her achieving her own orgasmic satisfaction from his hard,erect passivity, he had a curious sense of pride and satisfaction.'Ah, how good!' she whispered tremulously, and she became quite still,clinging to him."
2897,2,"And he lay there in his own isolation, but somehowproud.He stayed that time only the three days, and to Clifford was exactlythe same as on the first evening; to Connie also."
2898,2,"There was no breakingdown his external man.He wrote to Connie with the same plaintive melancholy note as ever,sometimes witty, and touched with a queer, sexless affection."
2899,2,"A kind ofhopeless affection he seemed to feel for her, and the essentialremoteness remained the same."
2900,2,"He was hopeless at the very core of him,and he wanted to be hopeless."
2901,2,He rather hated hope.
2902,2,"'UNE IMMENSEESPERANCE A TRAVERSE LA TERRE', he read somewhere, and his commentwas:'--and it's darned-well drowned everything worth having.'Connie never really understood him, but, in her way, she loved him."
2903,2,Andall the time she felt the reflection of his hopelessness in her.
2904,2,"Shecouldn't quite, quite love in hopelessness."
2905,2,"And he, being hopeless,couldn't ever quite love at all.So they went on for quite a time, writing, and meeting occasionally inLondon."
2906,2,"She still wanted the physical, sexual thrill she could get withhim by her own activity, his little orgasm being over."
2907,2,And he stillwanted to give it her.
2908,2,"Which was enough to keep them connected.And enough to give her a subtle sort of self-assurance, something blindand a little arrogant."
2909,2,"It was an almost mechanical confidence in herown powers, and went with a great cheerfulness.She was terrifically cheerful at Wragby."
2910,2,"And she used all her arousedcheerfulness and satisfaction to stimulate Clifford, so that he wrotehis best at this time, and was almost happy in his strange blind way.He really reaped the fruits of the sensual satisfaction she got out ofMichaelis' male passivity erect inside her."
2911,2,"But of course he never knewit, and if he had, he wouldn't have said thank you!Yet when those days of her grand joyful cheerfulness and stimulus weregone, quite gone, and she was depressed and irritable, how Cliffordlonged for them again! Perhaps if he'd known he might even have wishedto get her and Michaelis together again.Chapter 4Connie always had a foreboding of the hopelessness of her affair withMick, as people called him."
2912,2,Yet other men seemed to mean nothing toher.
2913,2,She was attached to Clifford.
2914,2,He wanted a good deal of her lifeand she gave it to him.
2915,2,"But she wanted a good deal from the life of aman, and this Clifford did not give her; could not."
2916,2,There wereoccasional spasms of Michaelis.
2917,2,"But, as she knew by foreboding, thatwould come to an end."
2918,2,Mick COULDN'T keep anything up.
2919,2,"It was part ofhis very being that he must break off any connexion, and be loose,isolated, absolutely lone dog again."
2920,2,"It was his major necessity, eventhough he always said: She turned me down!The world is supposed to be full of possibilities, but they narrow downto pretty few in most personal experience."
2921,2,"There's lots of good fish inthe sea...maybe...but the vast masses seem to be mackerel or herring,and if you're not mackerel or herring yourself you are likely to findvery few good fish in the sea.Clifford was making strides into fame, and even money."
2922,2,People came tosee him.
2923,2,Connie nearly always had somebody at Wragby.
2924,2,"But if theyweren't mackerel they were herring, with an occasional cat-fish, orconger-eel.There were a few regular men, constants; men who had been at Cambridgewith Clifford."
2925,2,"There was Tommy Dukes, who had remained in the army, andwas a Brigadier-General."
2926,2,"'The army leaves me time to think, and savesme from having to face the battle of life,' he said.There was Charles May, an Irishman, who wrote scientifically aboutstars."
2927,2,"There was Hammond, another writer."
2928,2,All were about the same ageas Clifford; the young intellectuals of the day.
2929,2,They all believed inthe life of the mind.
2930,2,"What you did apart from that was your privateaffair, and didn't much matter."
2931,2,No one thinks of inquiring of anotherperson at what hour he retires to the privy.
2932,2,"It isn't interesting toanyone but the person concerned.And so with most of the matters of ordinary life...how you make yourmoney, or whether you love your wife, or if you have 'affairs'."
2933,2,"Allthese matters concern only the person concerned, and, like going to theprivy, have no interest for anyone else.'The whole point about the sexual problem,' said Hammond, who was atall thin fellow with a wife and two children, but much more closelyconnected with a typewriter, 'is that there is no point to it."
2934,2,Strictlythere is no problem.
2935,2,"We don't want to follow a man into the w.c., sowhy should we want to follow him into bed with a woman? And thereinlies the problem."
2936,2,"If we took no more notice of the one thing than theother, there'd be no problem."
2937,2,"It's all utterly senseless and pointless;a matter of misplaced curiosity.''Quite, Hammond, quite! But if someone starts making love to Julia, youbegin to simmer; and if he goes on, you are soon at boilingpoint.'...Julia was Hammond's wife.'Why, exactly! So I should be if he began to urinate in a corner of mydrawing-room."
2938,2,"There's a place for all these things.''You mean you wouldn't mind if he made love to Julia in some discreetalcove?'Charlie May was slightly satirical, for he had flirted a very littlewith Julia, and Hammond had cut up very roughly.'Of course I should mind."
2939,2,"Sex is a private thing between me and Julia;and of course I should mind anyone else trying to mix in.''As a matter of fact,' said the lean and freckled Tommy Dukes, wholooked much more Irish than May, who was pale and rather fat: 'As amatter of fact, Hammond, you have a strong property instinct, and astrong will to self-assertion, and you want success."
2940,2,"Since I've been inthe army definitely, I've got out of the way of the world, and now Isee how inordinately strong the craving for self-assertion and successis in men."
2941,2,It is enormously overdeveloped.
2942,2,All our individuality hasrun that way.
2943,2,And of course men like you think you'll get throughbetter with a woman's backing.
2944,2,That's why you're so jealous.
2945,2,"That'swhat sex is to you...a vital little dynamo between you and Julia, tobring success."
2946,2,"If you began to be unsuccessful you'd begin to flirt,like Charlie, who isn't successful."
2947,2,"Married people like you and Juliahave labels on you, like travellers' trunks."
2948,2,Julia is labelled MRSARNOLD B.
2949,2,HAMMOND--just like a trunk on the railway that belongs tosomebody.
2950,2,And you are labelled ARNOLD B.
2951,2,"HAMMOND, C/o MRS ARNOLD B.HAMMOND."
2952,2,"Oh, you're quite right, you're quite right! The life of themind needs a comfortable house and decent cooking."
2953,2,You're quite right.It even needs posterity.
2954,2,But it all hinges on the instinct for success.That is the pivot on which all things turn.'Hammond looked rather piqued.
2955,2,"He was rather proud of the integrity ofhis mind, and of his NOT being a time-server."
2956,2,"None the less, he didwant success.'It's quite true, you can't live without cash,' said May."
2957,2,"'You've gotto have a certain amount of it to be able to live and get along...evento be free to THINK you must have a certain amount of money, or yourstomach stops you."
2958,2,But it seems to me you might leave the labels offsex.
2959,2,"We're free to talk to anybody; so why shouldn't we be free to makelove to any woman who inclines us that way?''There speaks the lascivious Celt,' said Clifford.'Lascivious! well, why not--? I can't see I do a woman any more harm bysleeping with her than by dancing with her...or even talking to herabout the weather."
2960,2,"It's just an interchange of sensations instead ofideas, so why not?''Be as promiscuous as the rabbits!' said Hammond.'Why not? What's wrong with rabbits? Are they any worse than aneurotic, revolutionary humanity, full of nervous hate?''But we're not rabbits, even so,' said Hammond.'Precisely! I have my mind: I have certain calculations to make incertain astronomical matters that concern me almost more than life ordeath."
2961,2,Sometimes indigestion interferes with me.
2962,2,Hunger would interferewith me disastrously.
2963,2,"In the same way starved sex interferes with me.What then?''I should have thought sexual indigestion from surfeit would haveinterfered with you more seriously,' said Hammond satirically.'Not it! I don't over-eat myself and I don't over-fuck myself."
2964,2,One hasa choice about eating too much.
2965,2,But you would absolutely starve me.''Not at all! You can marry.''How do you know I can? It may not suit the process of my mind.Marriage might...and would...stultify my mental processes.
2966,2,"I'm notproperly pivoted that way...and so must I be chained in a kennel like amonk? All rot and funk, my boy."
2967,2,I must live and do my calculations.
2968,2,Ineed women sometimes.
2969,2,"I refuse to make a mountain of it, and I refuseanybody's moral condemnation or prohibition."
2970,2,"I'd be ashamed to see awoman walking around with my name-label on her, address and railwaystation, like a wardrobe trunk.'These two men had not forgiven each other about the Julia flirtation.'It's an amusing idea, Charlie,' said Dukes, 'that sex is just anotherform of talk, where you act the words instead of saying them."
2971,2,I supposeit's quite true.
2972,2,"I suppose we might exchange as many sensations andemotions with women as we do ideas about the weather, and so on."
2973,2,Sexmight be a sort of normal physical conversation between a man and awoman.
2974,2,You don't talk to a woman unless you have ideas in common: thatis you don't talk with any interest.
2975,2,"And in the same way, unless youhad some emotion or sympathy in common with a woman you wouldn't sleepwith her."
2976,2,"But if you had...''If you HAVE the proper sort of emotion or sympathy with a woman, youOUGHT to sleep with her,' said May."
2977,2,"'It's the only decent thing, to goto bed with her."
2978,2,"Just as, when you are interested talking to someone,the only decent thing is to have the talk out."
2979,2,You don't prudishly putyour tongue between your teeth and bite it.
2980,2,"You just say out your say.And the same the other way.''No,' said Hammond."
2981,2,'It's wrong.
2982,2,"You, for example, May, you squanderhalf your force with women."
2983,2,"You'll never really do what you should do,with a fine mind such as yours."
2984,2,"Too much of it goes the other way.''Maybe it does...and too little of you goes that way, Hammond, my boy,married or not."
2985,2,"You can keep the purity and integrity of your mind, butit's going damned dry."
2986,2,"Your pure mind is going as dry as fiddlesticks,from what I see of it."
2987,2,"You're simply talking it down.'Tommy Dukes burst into a laugh.'Go it, you two minds!' he said."
2988,2,"'Look at me...I don't do any high andpure mental work, nothing but jot down a few ideas."
2989,2,And yet I neithermarry nor run after women.
2990,2,"I think Charlie's quite right; if he wantsto run after the women, he's quite free not to run too often."
2991,2,But Iwouldn't prohibit him from running.
2992,2,"As for Hammond, he's got a propertyinstinct, so naturally the straight road and the narrow gate are rightfor him."
2993,2,You'll see he'll be an English Man of Letters before he'sdone.
2994,2,A.B.C.
2995,2,from top to toe.
2996,2,Then there's me.
2997,2,I'm nothing.
2998,2,Just asquib.
2999,2,"And what about you, Clifford? Do you think sex is a dynamo tohelp a man on to success in the world?'Clifford rarely talked much at these times."
3000,2,"He never held forth; hisideas were really not vital enough for it, he was too confused andemotional."
3001,2,"Now he blushed and looked uncomfortable.'Well!' he said, 'being myself HORS DE COMBAT, I don't see I'veanything to say on the matter.''Not at all,' said Dukes; 'the top of you's by no means HORS DE COMBAT.You've got the life of the mind sound and intact."
3002,2,"So let us hear yourideas.''Well,' stammered Clifford, 'even then I don't suppose I have muchidea...I suppose marry-and-have-done-with-it would pretty well standfor what I think."
3003,2,"Though of course between a man and woman who care forone another, it is a great thing.''What sort of great thing?' said Tommy.'Oh...it perfects the intimacy,' said Clifford, uneasy as a woman insuch talk.'Well, Charlie and I believe that sex is a sort of communication likespeech."
3004,2,"Let any woman start a sex conversation with me, and it'snatural for me to go to bed with her to finish it, all in due season.Unfortunately no woman makes any particular start with me, so I go tobed by myself; and am none the worse for it...I hope so, anyway, forhow should I know? Anyhow I've no starry calculations to be interferedwith, and no immortal works to write."
3005,2,I'm merely a fellow skulking inthe army...'Silence fell.
3006,2,The four men smoked.
3007,2,"And Connie sat there and put anotherstitch in her sewing...Yes, she sat there! She had to sit mum."
3008,2,"She hadto be quiet as a mouse, not to interfere with the immensely importantspeculations of these highly-mental gentlemen."
3009,2,But she had to be there.They didn't get on so well without her; their ideas didn't flow sofreely.
3010,2,"Clifford was much more hedgy and nervous, he got cold feet muchquicker in Connie's absence, and the talk didn't run."
3011,2,Tommy Dukes cameoff best; he was a little inspired by her presence.
3012,2,Hammond she didn'treally like; he seemed so selfish in a mental way.
3013,2,"And Charles May,though she liked something about him, seemed a little distasteful andmessy, in spite of his stars.How many evenings had Connie sat and listened to the manifestations ofthese four men! these, and one or two others."
3014,2,That they never seemed toget anywhere didn't trouble her deeply.
3015,2,"She liked to hear what they hadto say, especially when Tommy was there."
3016,2,It was fun.
3017,2,"Instead of menkissing you, and touching you with their bodies, they revealed theirminds to you."
3018,2,It was great fun! But what cold minds!And also it was a little irritating.
3019,2,"She had more respect forMichaelis, on whose name they all poured such withering contempt, as alittle mongrel arriviste, and uneducated bounder of the worst sort.Mongrel and bounder or not, he jumped to his own conclusions."
3020,2,"He didn'tmerely walk round them with millions of words, in the parade of thelife of the mind.Connie quite liked the life of the mind, and got a great thrill out ofit."
3021,2,But she did think it overdid itself a little.
3022,2,"She loved beingthere, amidst the tobacco smoke of those famous evenings of thecronies, as she called them privately to herself."
3023,2,"She was infinitelyamused, and proud too, that even their talking they could not do,without her silent presence."
3024,2,"She had an immense respect forthought...and these men, at least, tried to think honestly."
3025,2,"But somehowthere was a cat, and it wouldn't jump."
3026,2,"They all alike talked atsomething, though what it was, for the life of her she couldn't say."
3027,2,"Itwas something that Mick didn't clear, either.But then Mick wasn't trying to do anything, but just get through hislife, and put as much across other people as they tried to put acrosshim."
3028,2,"He was really anti-social, which was what Clifford and his cronieshad against him."
3029,2,"Clifford and his cronies were not anti-social; theywere more or less bent on saving mankind, or on instructing it, to saythe least.There was a gorgeous talk on Sunday evening, when the conversationdrifted again to love.'Blest be the tie that bindsOur hearts in kindred something-or-other'--said Tommy Dukes."
3030,2,'I'd like to know what the tie is...The tie thatbinds us just now is mental friction on one another.
3031,2,"And, apart fromthat, there's damned little tie between us."
3032,2,"We bust apart, and sayspiteful things about one another, like all the other damnedintellectuals in the world."
3033,2,"Damned everybodies, as far as that goes,for they all do it."
3034,2,"Else we bust apart, and cover up the spitefulthings we feel against one another by saying false sugaries."
3035,2,"It's acurious thing that the mental life seems to flourish with its roots inspite, ineffable and fathomless spite."
3036,2,"Always has been so! Look atSocrates, in Plato, and his bunch round him! The sheer spite of it all,just sheer joy in pulling somebody else to bits...Protagoras, orwhoever it was! And Alcibiades, and all the other little disciple dogsjoining in the fray! I must say it makes one prefer Buddha, quietlysitting under a bo-tree, or Jesus, telling his disciples little Sundaystories, peacefully, and without any mental fireworks."
3037,2,"No, there'ssomething wrong with the mental life, radically."
3038,2,"It's rooted in spiteand envy, envy and spite."
3039,2,"Ye shall know the tree by its fruit.''I don't think we're altogether so spiteful,' protested Clifford.'My dear Clifford, think of the way we talk each other over, all of us.I'm rather worse than anybody else, myself."
3040,2,"Because I infinitely preferthe spontaneous spite to the concocted sugaries; now they ARE poison;when I begin saying what a fine fellow Clifford is, etc., etc., thenpoor Clifford is to be pitied."
3041,2,"For God's sake, all of you, say spitefulthings about me, then I shall know I mean something to you."
3042,2,"Don't saysugaries, or I'm done.''Oh, but I do think we honestly like one another,' said Hammond.'I tell you we must...we say such spiteful things to one another, aboutone another, behind our backs! I'm the worst.''And I do think you confuse the mental life with the critical activity.I agree with you, Socrates gave the critical activity a grand start,but he did more than that,' said Charlie May, rather magisterially."
3043,2,Thecronies had such a curious pomposity under their assumed modesty.
3044,2,"Itwas all so EX CATHEDRA, and it all pretended to be so humble.Dukes refused to be drawn about Socrates.'That's quite true, criticism and knowledge are not the same thing,'said Hammond.'They aren't, of course,' chimed in Berry, a brown, shy young man, whohad called to see Dukes, and was staying the night.They all looked at him as if the ass had spoken.'I wasn't talking about knowledge...I was talking about the mentallife,' laughed Dukes."
3045,2,'Real knowledge comes out of the whole corpus ofthe consciousness; out of your belly and your penis as much as out ofyour brain and mind.
3046,2,The mind can only analyse and rationalize.
3047,2,"Set themind and the reason to cock it over the rest, and all they can do is tocriticize, and make a deadness."
3048,2,I say ALL they can do.
3049,2,It is vastlyimportant.
3050,2,"My God, the world needs criticizing today...criticizing todeath."
3051,2,"Therefore let's live the mental life, and glory in our spite,and strip the rotten old show."
3052,2,"But, mind you, it's like this: while youLIVE your life, you are in some way an Organic whole with all life."
3053,2,"The Brangwens had lived for generations on the Marsh Farm, in themeadows where the Erewash twisted sluggishly through alder trees,separating Derbyshire from Nottinghamshire."
3054,2,"Two miles away, achurch-tower stood on a hill, the houses of the little country townclimbing assiduously up to it."
3055,2,"Whenever one of the Brangwens in thefields lifted his head from his work, he saw the church-tower atIlkeston in the empty sky."
3056,2,"So that as he turned again to the horizontalland, he was aware of something standing above him and beyond him inthe distance.There was a look in the eyes of the Brangwens as if they were expectingsomething unknown, about which they were eager."
3057,2,"They had that air ofreadiness for what would come to them, a kind of surety, an expectancy,the look of an inheritor.They were fresh, blond, slow-speaking people, revealing themselvesplainly, but slowly, so that one could watch the change in their eyesfrom laughter to anger, blue, lit-up laughter, to a hard blue-staringanger; through all the irresolute stages of the sky when the weather ischanging.Living on rich land, on their own land, near to a growing town, theyhad forgotten what it was to be in straitened circumstances."
3058,2,"They hadnever become rich, because there were always children, and thepatrimony was divided every time."
3059,2,"But always, at the Marsh, there wasample.So the Brangwens came and went without fear of necessity, working hardbecause of the life that was in them, not for want of the money.Neither were they thriftless."
3060,2,"They were aware of the last halfpenny,and instinct made them not waste the peeling of their apple, for itwould help to feed the cattle."
3061,2,"But heaven and earth was teeming aroundthem, and how should this cease? They felt the rush of the sap inspring, they knew the wave which cannot halt, but every year throwsforward the seed to begetting, and, falling back, leaves the young-bornon the earth."
3062,2,"They knew the intercourse between heaven and earth,sunshine drawn into the breast and bowels, the rain sucked up in thedaytime, nakedness that comes under the wind in autumn, showing thebirds' nests no longer worth hiding."
3063,2,"Their life and interrelations weresuch; feeling the pulse and body of the soil, that opened to theirfurrow for the grain, and became smooth and supple after theirploughing, and clung to their feet with a weight that pulled likedesire, lying hard and unresponsive when the crops were to be shornaway."
3064,2,"The young corn waved and was silken, and the lustre slid alongthe limbs of the men who saw it."
3065,2,"They took the udder of the cows, thecows yielded milk and pulse against the hands of the men, the pulse ofthe blood of the teats of the cows beat into the pulse of the hands ofthe men."
3066,2,"They mounted their horses, and held life between the grip oftheir knees, they harnessed their horses at the wagon, and, with handon the bridle-rings, drew the heaving of the horses after their will.In autumn the partridges whirred up, birds in flocks blew like sprayacross the fallow, rooks appeared on the grey, watery heavens, and flewcawing into the winter."
3067,2,"Then the men sat by the fire in the house wherethe women moved about with surety, and the limbs and the body of themen were impregnated with the day, cattle and earth and vegetation andthe sky, the men sat by the fire and their brains were inert, as theirblood flowed heavy with the accumulation from the living day.The women were different."
3068,2,"On them too was the drowse of blood-intimacy,calves sucking and hens running together in droves, and young geesepalpitating in the hand while the food was pushed down their throttle.But the women looked out from the heated, blind intercourse offarm-life, to the spoken world beyond."
3069,2,"They were aware of the lips andthe mind of the world speaking and giving utterance, they heard thesound in the distance, and they strained to listen.It was enough for the men, that the earth heaved and opened its furrowto them, that the wind blew to dry the wet wheat, and set the youngears of corn wheeling freshly round about; it was enough that theyhelped the cow in labour, or ferreted the rats from under the barn, orbroke the back of a rabbit with a sharp knock of the hand."
3070,2,"So muchwarmth and generating and pain and death did they know in their blood,earth and sky and beast and green plants, so much exchange andinterchange they had with these, that they lived full and surcharged,their senses full fed, their faces always turned to the heat of the blood,staring into the sun, dazed with looking towards the source of generation,unable to turn round.But the woman wanted another form of life than this, something that wasnot blood-intimacy."
3071,2,"Her house faced out from the farm-buildings andfields, looked out to the road and the village with church and Hall andthe world beyond."
3072,2,"She stood to see the far-off world of cities andgovernments and the active scope of man, the magic land to her, wheresecrets were made known and desires fulfilled."
3073,2,"She faced outwards towhere men moved dominant and creative, having turned their back on thepulsing heat of creation, and with this behind them, were set out todiscover what was beyond, to enlarge their own scope and range andfreedom; whereas the Brangwen men faced inwards to the teeming life ofcreation, which poured unresolved into their veins.Looking out, as she must, from the front of her house towards theactivity of man in the world at large, whilst her husband looked out tothe back at sky and harvest and beast and land, she strained her eyesto see what man had done in fighting outwards to knowledge, shestrained to hear how he uttered himself in his conquest, her deepestdesire hung on the battle that she heard, far off, being waged on theedge of the unknown."
3074,2,"She also wanted to know, and to be of the fightinghost.At home, even so near as Cossethay, was the vicar, who spoke the other,magic language, and had the other, finer bearing, both of which shecould perceive, but could never attain to."
3075,2,The vicar moved in worldsbeyond where her own menfolk existed.
3076,2,"Did she not know her own menfolk:fresh, slow, full-built men, masterful enough, but easy, native to theearth, lacking outwardness and range of motion."
3077,2,"Whereas the vicar, darkand dry and small beside her husband, had yet a quickness and a rangeof being that made Brangwen, in his large geniality, seem dull andlocal."
3078,2,She knew her husband.
3079,2,But in the vicar's nature was that whichpassed beyond her knowledge.
3080,2,As Brangwen had power over the cattle sothe vicar had power over her husband.
3081,2,"What was it in the vicar, thatraised him above the common men as man is raised above the beast? Shecraved to know."
3082,2,"She craved to achieve this higher being, if not inherself, then in her children."
3083,2,"That which makes a man strong even if hebe little and frail in body, just as any man is little and frail besidea bull, and yet stronger than the bull, what was it? It was not moneynor power nor position."
3084,2,What power had the vicar over TomBrangwen-none.
3085,2,"Yet strip them and set them on a desert island, and thevicar was the master."
3086,2,His soul was master of the other man's.
3087,2,"Andwhy-why? She decided it was a question of knowledge.The curate was poor enough, and not very efficacious as a man, either,yet he took rank with those others, the superior."
3088,2,"She watched hischildren being born, she saw them running as tiny things beside theirmother."
3089,2,"And already they were separate from her own children, distinct.Why were her own children marked below the others? Why should thecurate's children inevitably take precedence over her children, whyshould dominance be given them from the start? It was not money, noreven class."
3090,2,"It was education and experience, she decided.It was this, this education, this higher form of being, that the motherwished to give to her children, so that they too could live the supremelife on earth."
3091,2,"For her children, at least the children of her heart,had the complete nature that should take place in equality with theliving, vital people in the land, not be left behind obscure among thelabourers."
3092,2,"Why must they remain obscured and stifled all their lives,why should they suffer from lack of freedom to move? How should theylearn the entry into the finer, more vivid circle of life?Her imagination was fired by the squire's lady at Shelly Hall, who cameto church at Cossethay with her little children, girls in tidy capes ofbeaver fur, and smart little hats, herself like a winter rose, so fairand delicate."
3093,2,"So fair, so fine in mould, so luminous, what was it thatMrs."
3094,2,"Hardy felt which she, Mrs."
3095,2,"Brangwen, did not feel? How was Mrs.Hardy's nature different from that of the common women of Cossethay, inwhat was it beyond them? All the women of Cossethay talked eagerlyabout Mrs."
3096,2,"Hardy, of her husband, her children, her guests, her dress,of her servants and her housekeeping."
3097,2,"The lady of the Hall was the livingdream of their lives, her life was the epic that inspired their lives.In her they lived imaginatively, and in gossiping of her husband whodrank, of her scandalous brother, of Lord William Bentley her friend,member of Parliament for the division, they had their own Odyssey enactingitself, Penelope and Ulysses before them, and Circe and the swine and theendless web.So the women of the village were fortunate."
3098,2,"They saw themselves in thelady of the manor, each of them lived her own fulfilment of the life ofMrs."
3099,2,Hardy.
3100,2,"And the Brangwen wife of the Marsh aspired beyond herself,towards the further life of the finer woman, towards the extended beingshe revealed, as a traveller in his self-contained manner revealsfar-off countries present in himself."
3101,2,"But why should a knowledge offar-off countries make a man's life a different thing, finer, bigger?And why is a man more than the beast and the cattle that serve him? Itis the same thing.The male part of the poem was filled in by such men as the vicar andLord William, lean, eager men with strange movements, men who hadcommand of the further fields, whose lives ranged over a great extent.Ah, it was something very desirable to know, this touch of thewonderful men who had the power of thought and comprehension."
3102,2,"The womenof the village might be much fonder of Tom Brangwen, and more at theirease with him, yet if their lives had been robbed of the vicar, and ofLord William, the leading shoot would have been cut away from them,they would have been heavy and uninspired and inclined to hate."
3103,2,"So longas the wonder of the beyond was before them, they could get along,whatever their lot."
3104,2,And Mrs.
3105,2,"Hardy, and the vicar, and Lord William,these moved in the wonder of the beyond, and were visible to the eyesof Cossethay in their motion.IIAbout 1840, a canal was constructed across the meadows of the MarshFarm, connecting the newly-opened collieries of the Erewash Valley."
3106,2,"Ahigh embankment travelled along the fields to carry the canal, whichpassed close to the homestead, and, reaching the road, went over in aheavy bridge.So the Marsh was shut off from Ilkeston, and enclosed in the smallvalley bed, which ended in a bushy hill and the village spire ofCossethay.The Brangwens received a fair sum of money from this trespass acrosstheir land."
3107,2,"Then, a short time afterwards, a colliery was sunk on theother side of the canal, and in a while the Midland Railway came downthe valley at the foot of the Ilkeston hill, and the invasion wascomplete."
3108,2,"The town grew rapidly, the Brangwens were kept busy producingsupplies, they became richer, they were almost tradesmen.Still the Marsh remained remote and original, on the old, quiet side ofthe canal embankment, in the sunny valley where slow water wound alongin company of stiff alders, and the road went under ash-trees past theBrangwens' garden gate.But, looking from the garden gate down the road to the right, there,through the dark archway of the canal's square aqueduct, was a collieryspinning away in the near distance, and further, red, crude housesplastered on the valley in masses, and beyond all, the dim smoking hillof the town.The homestead was just on the safe side of civilisation, outside thegate."
3109,2,"The house stood bare from the road, approached by a straightgarden path, along which at spring the daffodils were thick in greenand yellow."
3110,2,"At the sides of the house were bushes of lilac andguelder-rose and privet, entirely hiding the farm buildings behind.At the back a confusion of sheds spread into the home-close from out oftwo or three indistinct yards."
3111,2,"The duck-pond lay beyond the furthestwall, littering its white feathers on the padded earthen banks, blowingits stray soiled feathers into the grass and the gorse bushes below thecanal embankment, which rose like a high rampart near at hand, so thatoccasionally a man's figure passed in silhouette, or a man and a towinghorse traversed the sky.At first the Brangwens were astonished by all this commotion aroundthem."
3112,2,"The building of a canal across their land made them strangers intheir own place, this raw bank of earth shutting them off disconcertedthem."
3113,2,"As they worked in the fields, from beyond the now familiarembankment came the rhythmic run of the winding engines, startling atfirst, but afterwards a narcotic to the brain."
3114,2,"Then the shrill whistleof the trains re-echoed through the heart, with fearsome pleasure,announcing the far-off come near and imminent.As they drove home from town, the farmers of the land met the blackenedcolliers trooping from the pit-mouth."
3115,2,"As they gathered the harvest, thewest wind brought a faint, sulphurous smell of pit-refuse burning."
3116,2,"Asthey pulled the turnips in November, the sharpclink-clink-clink-clink-clink of empty trucks shunting on the line,vibrated in their hearts with the fact of other activity going onbeyond them.The Alfred Brangwen of this period had married a woman from Heanor, adaughter of the ""Black Horse""."
3117,2,"She was a slim, pretty, dark woman,quaint in her speech, whimsical, so that the sharp things she said didnot hurt."
3118,2,"She was oddly a thing to herself, rather querulous in hermanner, but intrinsically separate and indifferent, so that her longlamentable complaints, when she raised her voice against her husband inparticular and against everybody else after him, only made those whoheard her wonder and feel affectionately towards her, even while theywere irritated and impatient with her."
3119,2,"She railed long and loud abouther husband, but always with a balanced, easy-flying voice and a quaintmanner of speech that warmed his belly with pride and male triumphwhile he scowled with mortification at the things she said.Consequently Brangwen himself had a humorous puckering at the eyes, asort of fat laugh, very quiet and full, and he was spoilt like a lordof creation."
3120,2,"He calmly did as he liked, laughed at their railing,excused himself in a teasing tone that she loved, followed his naturalinclinations, and sometimes, pricked too near the quick, frightened andbroke her by a deep, tense fury which seemed to fix on him and hold himfor days, and which she would give anything to placate in him."
3121,2,"Theywere two very separate beings, vitally connected, knowing nothing ofeach other, yet living in their separate ways from one root.There were four sons and two daughters."
3122,2,"The eldest boy ran away earlyto sea, and did not come back."
3123,2,After this the mother was more the nodeand centre of attraction in the home.
3124,2,"The second boy, Alfred, whom themother admired most, was the most reserved."
3125,2,He was sent to school inIlkeston and made some progress.
3126,2,"But in spite of his dogged, yearningeffort, he could not get beyond the rudiments of anything, save ofdrawing."
3127,2,"At this, in which he had some power, he worked, as if it werehis hope."
3128,2,"After much grumbling and savage rebellion against everything,after much trying and shifting about, when his father was incensedagainst him and his mother almost despairing, he became a draughtsmanin a lace-factory in Nottingham.He remained heavy and somewhat uncouth, speaking with broad Derbyshireaccent, adhering with all his tenacity to his work and to his townposition, making good designs, and becoming fairly well-off."
3129,2,"But atdrawing, his hand swung naturally in big, bold lines, rather lax, sothat it was cruel for him to pedgill away at the lace designing,working from the tiny squares of his paper, counting and plotting andniggling."
3130,2,"He did it stubbornly, with anguish, crushing the bowelswithin him, adhering to his chosen lot whatever it should cost."
3131,2,"And hecame back into life set and rigid, a rare-spoken, almost surly man.He married the daughter of a chemist, who affected some socialsuperiority, and he became something of a snob, in his dogged fashion,with a passion for outward refinement in the household, mad whenanything clumsy or gross occurred."
3132,2,"Later, when his three children weregrowing up, and he seemed a staid, almost middle-aged man, he turnedafter strange women, and became a silent, inscrutable follower offorbidden pleasure, neglecting his indignant bourgeois wife without aqualm.Frank, the third son, refused from the first to have anything to dowith learning."
3133,2,From the first he hung round the slaughter-house whichstood away in the third yard at the back of the farm.
3134,2,"The Brangwenshad always killed their own meat, and supplied the neighbourhood."
3135,2,"Outof this grew a regular butcher's business in connection with the farm.As a child Frank had been drawn by the trickle of dark blood that ranacross the pavement from the slaughter-house to the crew-yard, by thesight of the man carrying across to the meat-shed a huge side of beef,with the kidneys showing, embedded in their heavy laps of fat.He was a handsome lad with soft brown hair and regular featuressomething like a later Roman youth."
3136,2,"He was more easily excitable, morereadily carried away than the rest, weaker in character."
3137,2,"At eighteen hemarried a little factory girl, a pale, plump, quiet thing with sly eyesand a wheedling voice, who insinuated herself into him and bore him achild every year and made a fool of him."
3138,2,"When he had taken over thebutchery business, already a growing callousness to it, and a sort ofcontempt made him neglectful of it."
3139,2,"He drank, and was often to be foundin his public house blathering away as if he knew everything, when inreality he was a noisy fool.Of the daughters, Alice, the elder, married a collier and lived for atime stormily in Ilkeston, before moving away to Yorkshire with hernumerous young family."
3140,2,"Effie, the younger, remained at home.The last child, Tom, was considerably younger than his brothers, so hadbelonged rather to the company of his sisters."
3141,2,He was his mother'sfavourite.
3142,2,"She roused herself to determination, and sent him forciblyaway to a grammar-school in Derby when he was twelve years old."
3143,2,"He didnot want to go, and his father would have given way, but Mrs."
3144,2,Brangwenhad set her heart on it.
3145,2,"Her slender, pretty, tightly-covered body,with full skirts, was now the centre of resolution in the house, andwhen she had once set upon anything, which was not often, the familyfailed before her.So Tom went to school, an unwilling failure from the first."
3146,2,"He believedhis mother was right in decreeing school for him, but he knew she wasonly right because she would not acknowledge his constitution."
3147,2,"He knew,with a child's deep, instinctive foreknowledge of what is going tohappen to him, that he would cut a sorry figure at school."
3148,2,"But he tookthe infliction as inevitable, as if he were guilty of his own nature,as if his being were wrong, and his mother's conception right."
3149,2,"If hecould have been what he liked, he would have been that which his motherfondly but deludedly hoped he was."
3150,2,"He would have been clever, andcapable of becoming a gentleman."
3151,2,"It was her aspiration for him,therefore he knew it as the true aspiration for any boy."
3152,2,"But you can'tmake a silk purse out of a sow's ear, as he told his mother very early,with regard to himself; much to her mortification and chagrin.When he got to school, he made a violent struggle against his physicalinability to study."
3153,2,"He sat gripped, making himself pale and ghastly inhis effort to concentrate on the book, to take in what he had to learn.But it was no good."
3154,2,"If he beat down his first repulsion, and got like asuicide to the stuff, he went very little further."
3155,2,He could not learndeliberately.
3156,2,"His mind simply did not work.In feeling he was developed, sensitive to the atmosphere around him,brutal perhaps, but at the same time delicate, very delicate."
3157,2,So he hada low opinion of himself.
3158,2,He knew his own limitation.
3159,2,He knew that hisbrain was a slow hopeless good-for-nothing.
3160,2,"So he was humble.But at the same time his feelings were more discriminating than thoseof most of the boys, and he was confused."
3161,2,"He was more sensuouslydeveloped, more refined in instinct than they."
3162,2,"For their mechanicalstupidity he hated them, and suffered cruel contempt for them."
3163,2,"But whenit came to mental things, then he was at a disadvantage."
3164,2,He was attheir mercy.
3165,2,He was a fool.
3166,2,"He had not the power to controvert even themost stupid argument, so that he was forced to admit things he did notin the least believe."
3167,2,"And having admitted them, he did not know whetherhe believed them or not; he rather thought he did.But he loved anyone who could convey enlightenment to him throughfeeling."
3168,2,"He sat betrayed with emotion when the teacher of literatureread, in a moving fashion, Tennyson's ""Ulysses"", or Shelley's ""Ode tothe West Wind""."
3169,2,"His lips parted, his eyes filled with a strained,almost suffering light."
3170,2,"And the teacher read on, fired by his powerover the boy."
3171,2,"Tom Brangwen was moved by this experience beyond allcalculation, he almost dreaded it, it was so deep."
3172,2,"But when, almostsecretly and shamefully, he came to take the book himself, and began thewords ""Oh wild west wind, thou breath of autumn's being,"" the very fact ofthe print caused a prickly sensation of repulsion to go over his skin, theblood came to his face, his heart filled with a bursting passion ofrage and incompetence."
3173,2,He threw the book down and walked over it andwent out to the cricket field.
3174,2,And he hated books as if they were hisenemies.
3175,2,He hated them worse than ever he hated any person.He could not voluntarily control his attention.
3176,2,"His mind had no fixedhabits to go by, he had nothing to get hold of, nowhere to start from.For him there was nothing palpable, nothing known in himself, that hecould apply to learning."
3177,2,He did not know how to begin.
3178,2,"Therefore he washelpless when it came to deliberate understanding or deliberatelearning.He had an instinct for mathematics, but if this failed him, he washelpless as an idiot."
3179,2,"So that he felt that the ground was never sureunder his feet, he was nowhere."
3180,2,His final downfall was his completeinability to attend to a question put without suggestion.
3181,2,"If he had towrite a formal composition on the Army, he did at last learn to repeatthe few facts he knew: ""You can join the army at eighteen."
3182,2,"You have tobe over five foot eight."" But he had all the time a living convictionthat this was a dodge and that his common-places were beneath contempt.Then he reddened furiously, felt his bowels sink with shame, scratchedout what he had written, made an agonised effort to think of somethingin the real composition style, failed, became sullen with rage andhumiliation, put the pen down and would have been torn to pieces ratherthan attempt to write another word.He soon got used to the Grammar School, and the Grammar School got usedto him, setting him down as a hopeless duffer at learning, butrespecting him for a generous, honest nature."
3183,2,"Only one narrow,domineering fellow, the Latin master, bullied him and made the blueeyes mad with shame and rage."
3184,2,"There was a horrid scene, when the boylaid open the master's head with a slate, and then things went on asbefore."
3185,2,The teacher got little sympathy.
3186,2,"But Brangwen winced and couldnot bear to think of the deed, not even long after, when he was a grownman.He was glad to leave school."
3187,2,"It had not been unpleasant, he had enjoyedthe companionship of the other youths, or had thought he enjoyed it,the time had passed very quickly, in endless activity."
3188,2,"But he knew allthe time that he was in an ignominious position, in this place oflearning."
3189,2,"He was aware of failure all the while, of incapacity."
3190,2,"But hewas too healthy and sanguine to be wretched, he was too much alive."
3191,2,"Yethis soul was wretched almost to hopelessness.He had loved one warm, clever boy who was frail in body, a consumptivetype."
3192,2,"The two had had an almost classic friendship, David and Jonathan,wherein Brangwen was the Jonathan, the server."
3193,2,"But he had never feltequal with his friend, because the other's mind outpaced his, and lefthim ashamed, far in the rear."
3194,2,So the two boys went at once apart onleaving school.
3195,2,"But Brangwen always remembered his friend that hadbeen, kept him as a sort of light, a fine experience to remember.Tom Brangwen was glad to get back to the farm, where he was in his ownagain."
3196,2,"""I have got a turnip on my shoulders, let me stick to th'fallow,"" he said to his exasperated mother."
3197,2,He had too low an opinionof himself.
3198,2,"But he went about at his work on the farm gladly enough,glad of the active labour and the smell of the land again, having youthand vigour and humour, and a comic wit, having the will and the powerto forget his own shortcomings, finding himself violent with occasionalrages, but usually on good terms with everybody and everything.When he was seventeen, his father fell from a stack and broke his neck.Then the mother and son and daughter lived on at the farm, interruptedby occasional loud-mouthed lamenting, jealous-spirited visitations fromthe butcher Frank, who had a grievance against the world, which he feltwas always giving him less than his dues."
3199,2,"Frank was particularlyagainst the young Tom, whom he called a mardy baby, and Tom returnedthe hatred violently, his face growing red and his blue eyes staring.Effie sided with Tom against Frank."
3200,2,"But when Alfred came, fromNottingham, heavy jowled and lowering, speaking very little,but treating those at home with some contempt, Effie and the mothersided with him and put Tom into the shade."
3201,2,"It irritated the youth thathis elder brother should be made something of a hero by the women, justbecause he didn't live at home and was a lace-designer and almost agentleman."
3202,2,"But Alfred was something of a Prometheus Bound, so the womenloved him."
3203,2,"Tom came later to understand his brother better.As youngest son, Tom felt some importance when the care of the farmdevolved on to him."
3204,2,"He was only eighteen, but he was quite capable ofdoing everything his father had done."
3205,2,"And of course, his motherremained as centre to the house.The young man grew up very fresh and alert, with zest for every momentof life."
3206,2,"He worked and rode and drove to market, he went out withcompanions and got tipsy occasionally and played skittles and went tothe little travelling theatres."
3207,2,"Once, when he was drunk at a publichouse, he went upstairs with a prostitute who seduced him."
3208,2,He was thennineteen.The thing was something of a shock to him.
3209,2,"In the close intimacy of thefarm kitchen, the woman occupied the supreme position."
3210,2,"The men deferredto her in the house, on all household points, on all points of moralityand behaviour."
3211,2,The woman was the symbol for that further life whichcomprised religion and love and morality.
3212,2,"The men placed in her handstheir own conscience, they said to her ""Be my conscience-keeper, bethe angel at the doorway guarding my outgoing and my incoming."" And thewoman fulfilled her trust, the men rested implicitly in her, receivingher praise or her blame with pleasure or with anger, rebelling andstorming, but never for a moment really escaping in their own soulsfrom her prerogative."
3213,2,They depended on her for their stability.
3214,2,"Withouther, they would have felt like straws in the wind, to be blown hitherand thither at random."
3215,2,"She was the anchor and the security, she was therestraining hand of God, at times highly to be execrated.Now when Tom Brangwen, at nineteen, a youth fresh like a plant, rootedin his mother and his sister, found that he had lain with a prostitutewoman in a common public house, he was very much startled."
3216,2,For himthere was until that time only one kind of woman-his mother and sister.But now? He did not know what to feel.
3217,2,"There was a slight wonder, apang of anger, of disappointment, a first taste of ash and of cold fearlest this was all that would happen, lest his relations with woman weregoing to be no more than this nothingness; there was a slight sense ofshame before the prostitute, fear that she would despise him for hisinefficiency; there was a cold distaste for her, and a fear of her;there was a moment of paralysed horror when he felt he might have takena disease from her; and upon all this startled tumult of emotion, waslaid the steadying hand of common sense, which said it did not mattervery much, so long as he had no disease."
3218,2,"He soon recovered balance, andreally it did not matter so very much.But it had shocked him, and put a mistrust into his heart, andemphasised his fear of what was within himself."
3219,2,"He was, however, in afew days going about again in his own careless, happy-go-lucky fashion,his blue eyes just as clear and honest as ever, his face just as fresh,his appetite just as keen.Or apparently so."
3220,2,"He had, in fact, lost some of his buoyant confidence,and doubt hindered his outgoing.For some time after this, he was quieter, more conscious when he drank,more backward from companionship."
3221,2,"The disillusion of his first carnalcontact with woman, strengthened by his innate desire to find in awoman the embodiment of all his inarticulate, powerful religiousimpulses, put a bit in his mouth."
3222,2,"He had something to lose which he wasafraid of losing, which he was not sure even of possessing."
3223,2,"This firstaffair did not matter much: but the business of love was, at the bottomof his soul, the most serious and terrifying of all to him.He was tormented now with sex desire, his imagination reverted alwaysto lustful scenes."
3224,2,"But what really prevented his returning to a loosewoman, over and above the natural squeamishness, was the recollectionof the paucity of the last experience."
3225,2,"It had been so nothing, sodribbling and functional, that he was ashamed to expose himself to therisk of a repetition of it.He made a strong, instinctive fight to retain his native cheerfulnessunimpaired."
3226,2,"He had naturally a plentiful stream of life and humour, asense of sufficiency and exuberance, giving ease."
3227,2,But now it tended tocause tension.
3228,2,"A strained light came into his eyes, he had a slightknitting of the brows."
3229,2,"His boisterous humour gave place to loweringsilences, and days passed by in a sort of suspense.He did not know there was any difference in him, exactly; for the mostpart he was filled with slow anger and resentment."
3230,2,"But he knew he wasalways thinking of women, or a woman, day in, day out, and thatinfuriated him."
3231,2,He could not get free: and he was ashamed.
3232,2,"He had oneor two sweethearts, starting with them in the hope of speedydevelopment."
3233,2,"But when he had a nice girl, he found that he wasincapable of pushing the desired development."
3234,2,The very presence of thegirl beside him made it impossible.
3235,2,"He could not think of her likethat, he could not think of her actual nakedness."
3236,2,"She was a girl and heliked her, and dreaded violently even the thought of uncovering her."
3237,2,"Heknew that, in these last issues of nakedness, he did not exist to hernor she to him."
3238,2,"Again, if he had a loose girl, and things began todevelop, she offended him so deeply all the time, that he never knewwhether he was going to get away from her as quickly as possible, orwhether he were going to take her out of inflamed necessity."
3239,2,Again helearnt his lesson: if he took her it was a paucity which he was forcedto despise.
3240,2,He did not despise himself nor the girl.
3241,2,"But he despisedthe net result in him of the experience-he despised it deeply andbitterly.Then, when he was twenty-three, his mother died, and he was left athome with Effie."
3242,2,"His mother's death was another blow out of the dark.He could not understand it, he knew it was no good his trying."
3243,2,One hadto submit to these unforeseen blows that come unawares and leave abruise that remains and hurts whenever it is touched.
3244,2,He began to beafraid of all that which was up against him.
3245,2,"He had loved his mother.After this, Effie and he quarrelled fiercely."
3246,2,"They meant a very greatdeal to each other, but they were both under a strange, unnaturaltension."
3247,2,He stayed out of the house as much as possible.
3248,2,"He got aspecial corner for himself at the ""Red Lion"" at Cossethay, and became ausual figure by the fire, a fresh, fair young fellow with heavy limbsand head held back, mostly silent, though alert and attentive, veryhearty in his greeting of everybody he knew, shy of strangers."
3249,2,"Heteased all the women, who liked him extremely, and he was veryattentive to the talk of the men, very respectful.To drink made him quickly flush very red in the face, and brought outthe look of self-consciousness and unsureness, almost bewilderment, inhis blue eyes."
3250,2,"When he came home in this state of tipsy confusion hissister hated him and abused him, and he went off his head, like a madbull with rage.He had still another turn with a light-o'-love."
3251,2,"One Whitsuntide he wenta jaunt with two other young fellows, on horseback, to Matlock andthence to Bakewell."
3252,2,"Matlock was at that time just becoming a famousbeauty-spot, visited from Manchester and from the Staffordshire towns.In the hotel where the young men took lunch, were two girls, and theparties struck up a friendship.The Miss who made up to Tom Brangwen, then twenty-four years old, was ahandsome, reckless girl neglected for an afternoon by the man who hadbrought her out."
3253,2,"She saw Brangwen and liked him, as all women did, forhis warmth and his generous nature, and for the innate delicacy in him.But she saw he was one who would have to be brought to the scratch.However, she was roused and unsatisfied and made mischievous, so shedared anything."
3254,2,"It would be an easy interlude, restoring her pride.She was a handsome girl with a bosom, and dark hair and blue eyes, agirl full of easy laughter, flushed from the sun, inclined to wipe herlaughing face in a very natural and taking manner.Brangwen was in a state of wonder."
3255,2,"He treated her with his chaffingdeference, roused, but very unsure of himself, afraid to death of beingtoo forward, ashamed lest he might be thought backward, mad withdesire yet restrained by instinctive regard for women from making anydefinite approach, feeling all the while that his attitude wasridiculous, and flushing deep with confusion."
3256,2,"She, however, became hardand daring as he became confused, it amused her to see him come on.""When must you get back?"" she asked.""I'm not particular,"" he said.There the conversation again broke down.Brangwen's companions were ready to go on.""Art commin', Tom,"" they called, ""or art for stoppin'?""""Ay, I'm commin',"" he replied, rising reluctantly, an angry sense offutility and disappointment spreading over him.He met the full, almost taunting look of the girl, and he trembled withunusedness.""Shall you come an' have a look at my mare,"" he said to her, with hishearty kindliness that was now shaken with trepidation.""Oh, I should like to,"" she said, rising.And she followed him, his rather sloping shoulders and his clothriding-gaiters, out of the room."
3257,2,"The young men got their own horses outof the stable.""Can you ride?"" Brangwen asked her.""I should like to if I could-I have never tried,"" she said.""Come then, an' have a try,"" he said.And he lifted her, he blushing, she laughing, into the saddle.""I s'll slip off-it's not a lady's saddle,"" she cried.""Hold yer tight,"" he said, and he led her out of the hotel gate.The girl sat very insecurely, clinging fast."
3258,2,"He put a hand on herwaist, to support her."
3259,2,"And he held her closely, he clasped her as in anembrace, he was weak with desire as he strode beside her.The horse walked by the river.""You want to sit straddle-leg,"" he said to her.""I know I do,"" she said.It was the time of very full skirts."
3260,2,"She managed to get astride thehorse, quite decently, showing an intent concern for covering herpretty leg.""It's a lot's better this road,"" she said, looking down at him.""Ay, it is,"" he said, feeling the marrow melt in his bones from thelook in her eyes."
3261,2,"""I dunno why they have that side-saddle business,twistin' a woman in two.""""Should us leave you then-you seem to be fixed up there?"" calledBrangwen's companions from the road.He went red with anger.""Ay-don't worry,"" he called back.""How long are yer stoppin'?"" they asked.""Not after Christmas,"" he said.And the girl gave a tinkling peal of laughter.""All right-by-bye!"" called his friends.And they cantered off, leaving him very flushed, trying to be quitenormal with the girl."
3262,2,"But presently he had gone back to the hotel andgiven his horse into the charge of an ostler and had gone off with thegirl into the woods, not quite knowing where he was or what he wasdoing."
3263,2,"His heart thumped and he thought it the most glorious adventure,and was mad with desire for the girl.Afterwards he glowed with pleasure."
3264,2,"By Jove, but that was somethinglike! He stayed the afternoon with the girl, and wanted to stay thenight."
3265,2,"She, however, told him this was impossible: her own man would beback by dark, and she must be with him."
3266,2,"He, Brangwen, must not let onthat there had been anything between them.She gave him an intimate smile, which made him feel confused andgratified.He could not tear himself away, though he had promised not to interferewith the girl."
3267,2,He stayed on at the hotel over night.
3268,2,"He saw the otherfellow at the evening meal: a small, middle-aged man with iron-greyhair and a curious face, like a monkey's, but interesting, in its wayalmost beautiful."
3269,2,Brangwen guessed that he was a foreigner.
3270,2,"He was incompany with another, an Englishman, dry and hard."
3271,2,"The four sat attable, two men and two women."
3272,2,"Brangwen watched with all his eyes.He saw how the foreigner treated the women with courteous contempt, asif they were pleasing animals."
3273,2,"Brangwen's girl had put on a ladylikemanner, but her voice betrayed her."
3274,2,"She wanted to win back her man.When dessert came on, however, the little foreigner turned round fromhis table and calmly surveyed the room, like one unoccupied."
3275,2,"Brangwenmarvelled over the cold, animal intelligence of the face."
3276,2,"The browneyes were round, showing all the brown pupil, like a monkey's, and justcalmly looking, perceiving the other person without referring to him atall."
3277,2,They rested on Brangwen.
3278,2,"The latter marvelled at the old faceturned round on him, looking at him without considering it necessary toknow him at all."
3279,2,"The eyebrows of the round, perceiving, but unconcernedeyes were rather high up, with slight wrinkles above them, just as amonkey's had."
3280,2,"It was an old, ageless face.The man was most amazingly a gentleman all the time, an aristocrat.Brangwen stared fascinated."
3281,2,"The girl was pushing her crumbs about onthe cloth, uneasily, flushed and angry.As Brangwen sat motionless in the hall afterwards, too much moved andlost to know what to do, the little stranger came up to him with abeautiful smile and manner, offering a cigarette and saying:""Will you smoke?""Brangwen never smoked cigarettes, yet he took the one offered, fumblingpainfully with thick fingers, blushing to the roots of his hair."
3282,2,"Thenhe looked with his warm blue eyes at the almost sardonic, lidded eyesof the foreigner."
3283,2,"The latter sat down beside him, and they began totalk, chiefly of horses.Brangwen loved the other man for his exquisite graciousness, for histact and reserve, and for his ageless, monkey-like self-surety."
3284,2,"Theytalked of horses, and of Derbyshire, and of farming."
3285,2,"The strangerwarmed to the young fellow with real warmth, and Brangwen was excited.He was transported at meeting this odd, middle-aged, dry-skinned man,personally."
3286,2,"The talk was pleasant, but that did not matter so much."
3287,2,"Itwas the gracious manner, the fine contact that was all.They talked a long while together, Brangwen flushing like a girl whenthe other did not understand his idiom."
3288,2,"Then they said good night, andshook hands."
3289,2,"Again the foreigner bowed and repeated his good night.""Good night, and bon voyage.""Then he turned to the stairs.Brangwen went up to his room and lay staring out at the stars of thesummer night, his whole being in a whirl."
3290,2,What was it all? There was alife so different from what he knew it.
3291,2,"What was there outside hisknowledge, how much? What was this that he had touched? What was he inthis new influence? What did everything mean? Where was life, in thatwhich he knew or all outside him?He fell asleep, and in the morning had ridden away before any othervisitors were awake."
3292,2,"He shrank from seeing any of them again, in themorning.His mind was one big excitement."
3293,2,The girl and the foreigner: he knewneither of their names.
3294,2,"Yet they had set fire to the homestead of hisnature, and he would be burned out of cover."
3295,2,"Of the two experiences,perhaps the meeting with the foreigner was the more significant."
3296,2,Butthe girl-he had not settled about the girl.He did not know.
3297,2,"He had to leave it there, as it was."
3298,2,"He could not sumup his experiences.The result of these encounters was, that he dreamed day and night,absorbedly, of a voluptuous woman and of the meeting with a small,withered foreigner of ancient breeding."
3299,2,"No sooner was his mind free, nosooner had he left his own companions, than he began to imagine anintimacy with fine-textured, subtle-mannered people such as theforeigner at Matlock, and amidst this subtle intimacy was always thesatisfaction of a voluptuous woman.He went about absorbed in the interest and the actuality of this dream.His eyes glowed, he walked with his head up, full of the exquisitepleasure of aristocratic subtlety and grace, tormented with the desirefor the girl.Then gradually the glow began to fade, and the cold material of hiscustomary life to show through."
3300,2,He resented it.
3301,2,"Was he cheated in hisillusion? He balked the mean enclosure of reality, stood stubbornlylike a bull at a gate, refusing to re-enter the well-known round of hisown life.He drank more than usual to keep up the glow."
3302,2,But it faded more andmore for all that.
3303,2,"He set his teeth at the commonplace, to which hewould not submit."
3304,2,"It resolved itself starkly before him, for all that.He wanted to marry, to get settled somehow, to get out of the quandaryhe found himself in."
3305,2,But how? He felt unable to move his limbs.
3306,2,"He hadseen a little creature caught in bird-lime, and the sight was anightmare to him."
3307,2,"He began to feel mad with the rage of impotency.He wanted something to get hold of, to pull himself out."
3308,2,But there wasnothing.
3309,2,"Steadfastly he looked at the young women, to find a one hecould marry."
3310,2,But not one of them did he want.
3311,2,"And he knew that the ideaof a life among such people as the foreigner was ridiculous.Yet he dreamed of it, and stuck to his dreams, and would not have thereality of Cossethay and Ilkeston."
3312,2,"There he sat stubbornly in hiscorner at the ""Red Lion"", smoking and musing and occasionally liftinghis beer-pot, and saying nothing, for all the world like a gorpingfarm-labourer, as he said himself.Then a fever of restless anger came upon him."
3313,2,He wanted to goaway-right away.
3314,2,He dreamed of foreign parts.
3315,2,But somehow he had nocontact with them.
3316,2,"And it was a very strong root which held him to theMarsh, to his own house and land.Then Effie got married, and he was left in the house with only Tilly,the cross-eyed woman-servant who had been with them for fifteen years.He felt things coming to a close."
3317,2,"All the time, he had held himselfstubbornly resistant to the action of the commonplace unreality whichwanted to absorb him."
3318,2,But now he had to do something.He was by nature temperate.
3319,2,"Being sensitive and emotional, his nauseaprevented him from drinking too much.But, in futile anger, with the greatest of determination and apparentgood humour, he began to drink in order to get drunk."
3320,2,"""Damn it,"" hesaid to himself, ""you must have it one road or another-you can't hitchyour horse to the shadow of a gate-post-if you've got legs you've gotto rise off your backside some time or other.""So he rose and went down to Ilkeston, rather awkwardly took his placeamong a gang of young bloods, stood drinks to the company, anddiscovered he could carry it off quite well."
3321,2,"He had an idea thateverybody in the room was a man after his own heart, that everythingwas glorious, everything was perfect."
3322,2,"When somebody in alarm told himhis coat pocket was on fire, he could only beam from a red, blissfulface and say ""Iss-all-ri-ight-iss-al'-ri-ight-it's a' right-let it be,let it be-"" and he laughed with pleasure, and was rather indignant thatthe others should think it unnatural for his coat pocket to burn:-itwas the happiest and most natural thing in the world-what?He went home talking to himself and to the moon, that was very high andsmall, stumbling at the flashes of moonlight from the puddles at hisfeet, wondering What the Hanover! then laughing confidently to themoon, assuring her this was first class, this was.In the morning he woke up and thought about it, and for the first timein his life, knew what it was to feel really acutely irritable, in amisery of real bad temper."
3323,2,"After bawling and snarling at Tilly, he tookhimself off for very shame, to be alone."
3324,2,"And looking at the ashenfields and the putty roads, he wondered what in the name of Hell hecould do to get out of this prickly sense of disgust and physicalrepulsion."
3325,2,And he knew that this was the result of his gloriousevening.And his stomach did not want any more brandy.
3326,2,"He went doggedly acrossthe fields with his terrier, and looked at everything with a jaundicedeye.The next evening found him back again in his place at the ""Red Lion"",moderate and decent."
3327,2,"There he sat and stubbornly waited for what wouldhappen next.Did he, or did he not believe that he belonged to this world ofCossethay and Ilkeston? There was nothing in it he wanted."
3328,2,"Yet could heever get out of it? Was there anything in himself that would carry himout of it? Or was he a dunderheaded baby, not man enough to be like theother young fellows who drank a good deal and wenched a little withoutany question, and were satisfied.He went on stubbornly for a time."
3329,2,Then the strain became too great forhim.
3330,2,"A hot, accumulated consciousness was always awake in his chest,his wrists felt swelled and quivering, his mind became full of lustfulimages, his eyes seemed blood-flushed."
3331,2,"He fought with himselffuriously, to remain normal."
3332,2,He did not seek any woman.
3333,2,He just went onas if he were normal.
3334,2,"Till he must either take some action or beat hishead against the wall.Then he went deliberately to Ilkeston, in silence, intent and beaten.He drank to get drunk."
3335,2,"He gulped down the brandy, and more brandy, tillhis face became pale, his eyes burning."
3336,2,And still he could not getfree.
3337,2,"He went to sleep in drunken unconsciousness, woke up at fouro'clock in the morning and continued drinking."
3338,2,He would get free.Gradually the tension in him began to relax.
3339,2,"He began to feel happy.His riveted silence was unfastened, he began to talk and babble."
3340,2,"He washappy and at one with all the world, he was united with all flesh in ahot blood-relationship."
3341,2,"So, after three days of incessantbrandy-drinking, he had burned out the youth from his blood, he hadachieved this kindled state of oneness with all the world, which is theend of youth's most passionate desire."
3342,2,"But he had achieved hissatisfaction by obliterating his own individuality, that which itdepended on his manhood to preserve and develop.So he became a bout-drinker, having at intervals these bouts of threeor four days of brandy-drinking, when he was drunk for the whole time.He did not think about it."
3343,2,A deep resentment burned in him.
3344,2,"He keptaloof from any women, antagonistic.When he was twenty-eight, a thick-limbed, stiff, fair man with freshcomplexion, and blue eyes staring very straight ahead, he was comingone day down from Cossethay with a load of seed out of Nottingham."
3345,2,"Itwas a time when he was getting ready for another bout of drinking, sohe stared fixedly before him, watchful yet absorbed, seeing everythingand aware of nothing, coiled in himself."
3346,2,"It was early in the year.He walked steadily beside the horse, the load clanked behind as thehill descended steeper."
3347,2,"The road curved down-hill before him, underbanks and hedges, seen only for a few yards ahead.Slowly turning the curve at the steepest part of the slope, his horsebritching between the shafts, he saw a woman approaching."
3348,2,But he wasthinking for the moment of the horse.Then he turned to look at her.
3349,2,"She was dressed in black, was apparentlyrather small and slight, beneath her long black cloak, and she wore ablack bonnet."
3350,2,"She walked hastily, as if unseeing, her head ratherforward."
3351,2,"It was her curious, absorbed, flitting motion, as if she werepassing unseen by everybody, that first arrested him.She had heard the cart, and looked up."
3352,2,"Her face was pale and clear, shehad thick dark eyebrows and a wide mouth, curiously held."
3353,2,"He saw herface clearly, as if by a light in the air."
3354,2,"He saw her face sodistinctly, that he ceased to coil on himself, and was suspended.""That's her,"" he said involuntarily."
3355,2,"As the cart passed by, splashingthrough the thin mud, she stood back against the bank."
3356,2,"Then, as hewalked still beside his britching horse, his eyes met hers."
3357,2,"He lookedquickly away, pressing back his head, a pain of joy running throughhim."
3358,2,He could not bear to think of anything.He turned round at the last moment.
3359,2,"He saw her bonnet, her shape in theblack cloak, the movement as she walked."
3360,2,Then she was gone round thebend.She had passed by.
3361,2,"He felt as if he were walking again in a far world,not Cossethay, a far world, the fragile reality."
3362,2,"He went on, quiet,suspended, rarefied."
3363,2,"He could not bear to think or to speak, nor makeany sound or sign, nor change his fixed motion."
3364,2,He could scarcely bearto think of her face.
3365,2,"He moved within the knowledge of her, in theworld that was beyond reality.The feeling that they had exchanged recognition possessed him like amadness, like a torment."
3366,2,"How could he be sure, what confirmation hadhe? The doubt was like a sense of infinite space, a nothingness,annihilating."
3367,2,He kept within his breast the will to surety.
3368,2,They hadexchanged recognition.He walked about in this state for the next few days.
3369,2,"And then againlike a mist it began to break to let through the common, barren world.He was very gentle with man and beast, but he dreaded the starkness ofdisillusion cropping through again.As he was standing with his back to the fire after dinner a few dayslater, he saw the woman passing."
3370,2,"He wanted to know that she knew him,that she was aware."
3371,2,He wanted it said that there was something betweenthem.
3372,2,"So he stood anxiously watching, looking at her as she went downthe road."
3373,2,"He called to Tilly.""Who might that be?"" he asked.Tilly, the cross-eyed woman of forty, who adored him, ran gladly to thewindow to look."
3374,2,She was glad when he asked her for anything.
3375,2,"She cranedher head over the short curtain, the little tight knob of her blackhair sticking out pathetically as she bobbed about.""Oh why""-she lifted her head and peered with her twisted, keen browneyes-""why, you know who it is-it's her from th' vicarage-you know-""""How do I know, you hen-bird,"" he shouted.Tilly blushed and drew her neck in and looked at him with hersquinting, sharp, almost reproachful look.""Why you do-it's the new housekeeper.""""Ay-an' what by that?""""Well, an' what by that?"" rejoined the indignant Tilly.""She's a woman, isn't she, housekeeper or no housekeeper? She's gotmore to her than that! Who is she-she's got a name?""""Well, if she has, I don't know,"" retorted Tilly, not to be badgered bythis lad who had grown up into a man.""What's her name?"" he asked, more gently.""I'm sure I couldn't tell you,"" replied Tilly, on her dignity.""An' is that all as you've gathered, as she's housekeeping at thevicarage?""""I've 'eered mention of 'er name, but I couldn't remember it for mylife.""""Why, yer riddle-skulled woman o' nonsense, what have you got a headfor?""""For what other folks 'as got theirs for,"" retorted Tilly, who lovednothing more than these tilts when he would call her names.There was a lull.""I don't believe as anybody could keep it in their head,"" thewoman-servant continued, tentatively.""What?"" he asked.""Why, 'er name.""""How's that?""""She's fra some foreign parts or other.""""Who told you that?""""That's all I do know, as she is.""""An' wheer do you reckon she's from, then?""""I don't know."
3376,2,They do say as she hails fra th' Pole.
3377,2,"I don't know,""Tilly hastened to add, knowing he would attack her.""Fra th' Pole, why do you hail fra th' Pole? Who set up that menagerieconfabulation?""""That's what they say-I don't know-""""Who says?""""Mrs."
3378,2,"Bentley says as she's fra th' Pole-else she is a Pole, orsummat.""Tilly was only afraid she was landing herself deeper now.""Who says she's a Pole?""""They all say so.""""Then what's brought her to these parts?""""I couldn't tell you."
3379,2,"She's got a little girl with her.""""Got a little girl with her?""""Of three or four, with a head like a fuzz-ball.""""Black?""""White-fair as can be, an' all of a fuzz.""""Is there a father, then?""""Not to my knowledge."
3380,2,"I don't know.""""What brought her here?""""I couldn't say, without th' vicar axed her.""""Is the child her child?""""I s'd think so-they say so.""""Who told you about her?""""Why, Lizzie-a-Monday-we seed her goin' past.""""You'd have to be rattling your tongues if anything went past.""Brangwen stood musing."
3381,2,"That evening he went up to Cossethay to the ""RedLion"", half with the intention of hearing more.She was the widow of a Polish doctor, he gathered."
3382,2,"Her husband haddied, a refugee, in London."
3383,2,"She spoke a bit foreign-like, but you couldeasily make out what she said."
3384,2,"She had one little girl named Anna.Lensky was the woman's name, Mrs."
3385,2,Lensky.Brangwen felt that here was the unreality established at last.
3386,2,"He feltalso a curious certainty about her, as if she were destined to him."
3387,2,"Itwas to him a profound satisfaction that she was a foreigner.A swift change had taken place on the earth for him, as if a newcreation were fulfilled, in which he had real existence."
3388,2,"Things had allbeen stark, unreal, barren, mere nullities before."
3389,2,Now they wereactualities that he could handle.He dared scarcely think of the woman.
3390,2,He was afraid.
3391,2,"Only all the timehe was aware of her presence not far off, he lived in her."
3392,2,"But he darednot know her, even acquaint himself with her by thinking of her.One day he met her walking along the road with her little girl."
3393,2,"It wasa child with a face like a bud of apple-blossom, and glistening fairhair like thistle-down sticking out in straight, wild, flamy pieces,and very dark eyes."
3394,2,"The child clung jealously to her mother's side whenhe looked at her, staring with resentful black eyes."
3395,2,"But the motherglanced at him again, almost vacantly."
3396,2,And the very vacancy of her lookinflamed him.
3397,2,"She had wide grey-brown eyes with very dark, fathomlesspupils."
3398,2,"He felt the fine flame running under his skin, as if all hisveins had caught fire on the surface."
3399,2,"And he went on walking withoutknowledge.It was coming, he knew, his fate."
3400,2,The world was submitting to itstransformation.
3401,2,"He made no move: it would come, what would come.When his sister Effie came to the Marsh for a week, he went with herfor once to church."
3402,2,"In the tiny place, with its mere dozen pews, he satnot far from the stranger."
3403,2,"There was a fineness about her, a poignancyabout the way she sat and held her head lifted."
3404,2,"She was strange, fromfar off, yet so intimate."
3405,2,"She was from far away, a presence, so closeto his soul."
3406,2,"She was not really there, sitting in Cossethay churchbeside her little girl."
3407,2,She was not living the apparent life of herdays.
3408,2,She belonged to somewhere else.
3409,2,"He felt it poignantly, assomething real and natural."
3410,2,"But a pang of fear for his own concretelife, that was only Cossethay, hurt him, and gave him misgiving.Her thick dark brows almost met above her irregular nose, she had awide, rather thick mouth."
3411,2,"But her face was lifted to another world oflife: not to heaven or death: but to some place where she still lived,in spite of her body's absence.The child beside her watched everything with wide, black eyes."
3412,2,"She hadan odd little defiant look, her little red mouth was pinched shut."
3413,2,"Sheseemed to be jealously guarding something, to be always on the alertfor defence."
3414,2,"She met Brangwen's near, vacant, intimate gaze, and apalpitating hostility, almost like a flame of pain, came into the wide,over-conscious dark eyes.The old clergyman droned on, Cossethay sat unmoved as usual."
3415,2,"And therewas the foreign woman with a foreign air about her, inviolate, and thestrange child, also foreign, jealously guarding something.When the service was over, he walked in the way of another existenceout of the church."
3416,2,"As he went down the churchpath with his sister,behind the woman and child, the little girl suddenly broke from hermother's hand, and slipped back with quick, almost invisible movement,and was picking at something almost under Brangwen's feet."
3417,2,"Her tinyfingers were fine and quick, but they missed the red button.""Have you found something?"" said Brangwen to her.And he also stooped for the button."
3418,2,"But she had got it, and she stoodback with it pressed against her little coat, her black eyes flaring athim, as if to forbid him to notice her."
3419,2,"Then, having silenced him, sheturned with a swift ""Mother-,"" and was gone down the path.The mother had stood watching impassive, looking not at the child, butat Brangwen."
3420,2,"He became aware of the woman looking at him, standingthere isolated yet for him dominant in her foreign existence.He did not know what to do, and turned to his sister."
3421,2,"But the wide greyeyes, almost vacant yet so moving, held him beyond himself.""Mother, I may have it, mayn't I?"" came the child's proud, silverytones."
3422,2,"""Mother""-she seemed always to be calling her mother to rememberher-""mother""-and she had nothing to continue now her mother had replied""Yes, my child."" But, with ready invention, the child stumbled and ranon, ""What are those people's names?""Brangwen heard the abstract:""I don't know, dear.""He went on down the road as if he were not living inside himself, butsomewhere outside.""Who was that person?"" his sister Effie asked.""I couldn't tell you,"" he answered unknowing.""She's somebody very funny,"" said Effie, almost in condemnation."
3423,2,"""Thatchild's like one bewitched.""""Bewitched-how bewitched?"" he repeated.""You can see for yourself."
3424,2,"The mother's plain, I must say-but the childis like a changeling."
3425,2,"She'd be about thirty-five.""But he took no notice."
3426,2,"His sister talked on.""There's your woman for you,"" she continued."
3427,2,"""You'd better marry her.""But still he took no notice."
3428,2,"Things were as they were.Another day, at tea-time, as he sat alone at table, there came a knockat the front door."
3429,2,It startled him like a portent.
3430,2,No one ever knockedat the front door.
3431,2,"He rose and began slotting back the bolts, turningthe big key."
3432,2,"When he had opened the door, the strange woman stood onthe threshold.""Can you give me a pound of butter?"" she asked, in a curious detachedway of one speaking a foreign language.He tried to attend to her question."
3433,2,She was looking at himquestioningly.
3434,2,"But underneath the question, what was there, in her verystanding motionless, which affected him?He stepped aside and she at once entered the house, as if the door hadbeen opened to admit her."
3435,2,That startled him.
3436,2,It was the custom foreverybody to wait on the doorstep till asked inside.
3437,2,"He went into thekitchen and she followed.His tea-things were spread on the scrubbed deal table, a big fire wasburning, a dog rose from the hearth and went to her."
3438,2,"She stoodmotionless just inside the kitchen.""Tilly,"" he called loudly, ""have we got any butter?""The stranger stood there like a silence in her black cloak.""Eh?"" came the shrill cry from the distance.He shouted his question again.""We've got what's on t' table,"" answered Tilly's shrill voice out ofthe dairy.Brangwen looked at the table."
3439,2,"There was a large pat of butter on aplate, almost a pound."
3440,2,"It was round, and stamped with acorns andoak-leaves.""Can't you come when you're wanted?"" he shouted.""Why, what d'you want?"" Tilly protested, as she came peekinginquisitively through the other door.She saw the strange woman, stared at her with cross-eyes, but saidnothing.""Haven't we any butter?"" asked Brangwen again, impatiently, as if hecould command some by his question.""I tell you there's what's on t' table,"" said Tilly, impatient that shewas unable to create any to his demand."
3441,2,"""We haven't a morsel besides.""There was a moment's silence.The stranger spoke, in her curiously distinct, detached manner of onewho must think her speech first.""Oh, then thank you very much."
3442,2,"I am sorry that I have come to troubleyou.""She could not understand the entire lack of manners, was slightlypuzzled."
3443,2,Any politeness would have made the situation quite impersonal.But here it was a case of wills in confusion.
3444,2,Brangwen flushed at herpolite speech.
3445,2,"Still he did not let her go.""Get summat an' wrap that up for her,"" he said to Tilly, looking at thebutter on the table.And taking a clean knife, he cut off that side of the butter where itwas touched.His speech, the ""for her"", penetrated slowly into the foreign woman andangered Tilly.""Vicar has his butter fra Brown's by rights,"" said the insuppressibleservant-woman."
3446,2,"""We s'll be churnin' to-morrow mornin' first thing.""""Yes""-the long-drawn foreign yes-""yes,"" said the Polish woman, ""I wentto Mrs."
3447,2,Brown's.
3448,2,"She hasn't any more.""Tilly bridled her head, bursting to say that, according to theetiquette of people who bought butter, it was no sort of mannerswhatever coming to a place cool as you like and knocking at the frontdoor asking for a pound as a stop-gap while your other people wereshort."
3449,2,"If you go to Brown's you go to Brown's, an' my butter isn't justto make shift when Brown's has got none.Brangwen understood perfectly this unspoken speech of Tilly's."
3450,2,ThePolish lady did not.
3451,2,"And as she wanted butter for the vicar, and asTilly was churning in the morning, she waited.""Sluther up now,"" said Brangwen loudly after this silence had resolveditself out; and Tilly disappeared through the inner door.""I am afraid that I should not come, so,"" said the stranger, looking athim enquiringly, as if referring to him for what it was usual to do.He felt confused.""How's that?"" he said, trying to be genial and being only protective.""Do you--?"" she began deliberately."
3452,2,"But she was not sure of her ground,and the conversation came to an end."
3453,2,"Her eyes looked at him all thewhile, because she could not speak the language.They stood facing each other."
3454,2,The dog walked away from her to him.
3455,2,"Hebent down to it.""And how's your little girl?"" he asked.""Yes, thank you, she is very well,"" was the reply, a phrase of politespeech in a foreign language merely.""Sit you down,"" he said.And she sat in a chair, her slim arms, coming through the slits of hercloak, resting on her lap.""You're not used to these parts,"" he said, still standing on thehearthrug with his back to the fire, coatless, looking with curiousdirectness at the woman."
3456,2,"Her self-possession pleased him and inspiredhim, set him curiously free."
3457,2,"It seemed to him almost brutal to feel somaster of himself and of the situation.Her eyes rested on him for a moment, questioning, as she thought of themeaning of his speech.""No,"" she said, understanding."
3458,2,"""No-it is strange.""""You find it middlin' rough?"" he said.Her eyes waited on him, so that he should say it again.""Our ways are rough to you,"" he repeated.""Yes-yes, I understand."
3459,2,"Yes, it is different, it is strange."
3460,2,"But I wasin Yorkshire--""""Oh, well then,"" he said, ""it's no worse here than what they are upthere.""She did not quite understand."
3461,2,"His protective manner, and his sureness,and his intimacy, puzzled her."
3462,2,"What did he mean? If he was her equal,why did he behave so without formality?""No--"" she said, vaguely, her eyes resting on him.She saw him fresh and naive, uncouth, almost entirely beyondrelationship with her."
3463,2,"Yet he was good-looking, with his fair hair andblue eyes full of energy, and with his healthy body that seemed to takeequality with her."
3464,2,She watched him steadily.
3465,2,"He was difficult for herto understand, warm, uncouth, and confident as he was, sure on his feetas if he did not know what it was to be unsure."
3466,2,What then was it thatgave him this curious stability?She did not know.
3467,2,She wondered.
3468,2,She looked round the room he lived in.It had a close intimacy that fascinated and almost frightened her.
3469,2,"Thefurniture was old and familiar as old people, the whole place seemed sokin to him, as if it partook of his being, that she was uneasy.""It is already a long time that you have lived in this house-yes?"" sheasked.""I've always lived here,"" he said.""Yes-but your people-your family?""""We've been here above two hundred years,"" he said."
3470,2,"Her eyes were onhim all the time, wide-open and trying to grasp him."
3471,2,"He felt that hewas there for her.""It is your own place, the house, the farm--?""""Yes,"" he said."
3472,2,He looked down at her and met her look.
3473,2,It disturbedher.
3474,2,She did not know him.
3475,2,"He was a foreigner, they had nothing to dowith each other."
3476,2,Yet his look disturbed her to knowledge of him.
3477,2,"He wasso strangely confident and direct.""You live quite alone?""""Yes-if you call it alone?""She did not understand."
3478,2,It seemed unusual to her.
3479,2,"What was the meaningof it?And whenever her eyes, after watching him for some time, inevitably methis, she was aware of a heat beating up over her consciousness."
3480,2,She satmotionless and in conflict.
3481,2,"Who was this strange man who was at once sonear to her? What was happening to her? Something in his young,warm-twinkling eyes seemed to assume a right to her, to speak to her,to extend her his protection."
3482,2,"But how? Why did he speak to her? Whywere his eyes so certain, so full of light and confident, waiting forno permission nor signal?Tilly returned with a large leaf and found the two silent."
3483,2,"At once hefelt it incumbent on him to speak, now the serving-woman had come back.""How old is your little girl?"" he asked.""Four years,"" she replied.""Her father hasn't been dead long, then?"" he asked.""She was one year when he died.""""Three years?""""Yes, three years that he is dead-yes.""Curiously quiet she was, almost abstracted, answering these questions.She looked at him again, with some maidenhood opening in her eyes."
3484,2,"Hefelt he could not move, neither towards her nor away from her.Something about her presence hurt him, till he was almost rigid beforeher."
3485,2,"He saw the girl's wondering look rise in her eyes.Tilly handed her the butter and she rose.""Thank you very much,"" she said."
3486,2,"""How much is it?""""We'll make th' vicar a present of it,"" he said."
3487,2,"""It'll do for me goin'to church.""""It 'ud look better of you if you went to church and took th' money foryour butter,"" said Tilly, persistent in her claim to him.""You'd have to put in, shouldn't you?"" he said.""How much, please?"" said the Polish woman to Tilly."
3488,2,"Brangwen stood byand let be.""Then, thank you very much,"" she said.""Bring your little girl down sometime to look at th' fowls and horses,""he said,-""if she'd like it.""""Yes, she would like it,"" said the stranger.And she went."
3489,2,Brangwen stood dimmed by her departure.
3490,2,"He could notnotice Tilly, who was looking at him uneasily, wanting to be reassured.He could not think of anything."
3491,2,"He felt that he had made some invisibleconnection with the strange woman.A daze had come over his mind, he had another centre of consciousness.In his breast, or in his bowels, somewhere in his body, there hadstarted another activity."
3492,2,"It was as if a strong light were burningthere, and he was blind within it, unable to know anything, except thatthis transfiguration burned between him and her, connecting them, likea secret power.Since she had come to the house he went about in a daze, scarcelyseeing even the things he handled, drifting, quiescent, in a state ofmetamorphosis."
3493,2,"He submitted to that which was happening to him, lettinggo his will, suffering the loss of himself, dormant always on the brinkof ecstasy, like a creature evolving to a new birth.She came twice with her child to the farm, but there was this lullbetween them, an intense calm and passivity like a torpor upon them, sothat there was no active change took place."
3494,2,"He was almost unaware ofthe child, yet by his native good humour he gained her confidence, evenher affection, setting her on a horse to ride, giving her corn for thefowls.Once he drove the mother and child from Ilkeston, picking them up onthe road."
3495,2,"The child huddled close to him as if for love, the mother satvery still."
3496,2,"There was a vagueness, like a soft mist over all of them,and a silence as if their wills were suspended."
3497,2,"Only he saw her hands,ungloved, folded in her lap, and he noticed the wedding-ring on herfinger."
3498,2,It excluded him: it was a closed circle.
3499,2,"It bound her life, thewedding-ring, it stood for her life in which he could have no part.Nevertheless, beyond all this, there was herself and himself whichshould meet.As he helped her down from the trap, almost lifting her, he felt he hadsome right to take her thus between his hands."
3500,2,"She belonged as yet tothat other, to that which was behind."
3501,2,"But he must care for her also.She was too living to be neglected.Sometimes her vagueness, in which he was lost, made him angry, made himrage."
3502,2,But he held himself still as yet.
3503,2,"She had no response, no beingtowards him."
3504,2,"It puzzled and enraged him, but he submitted for a longtime."
3505,2,"Then, from the accumulated troubling of her ignoring him,gradually a fury broke out, destructive, and he wanted to go away, toescape her.It happened she came down to the Marsh with the child whilst he was inthis state."
3506,2,"Then he stood over against her, strong and heavy in hisrevolt, and though he said nothing, still she felt his anger and heavyimpatience grip hold of her, she was shaken again as out of a torpor.Again her heart stirred with a quick, out-running impulse, she lookedat him, at the stranger who was not a gentleman yet who insisted oncoming into her life, and the pain of a new birth in herself strung allher veins to a new form."
3507,2,"She would have to begin again, to find a newbeing, a new form, to respond to that blind, insistent figure standingover against her.A shiver, a sickness of new birth passed over her, the flame leaped uphim, under his skin."
3508,2,"She wanted it, this new life from him, with him,yet she must defend herself against it, for it was a destruction.As he worked alone on the land, or sat up with his ewes at lambingtime, the facts and material of his daily life fell away, leaving thekernel of his purpose clean."
3509,2,"And then it came upon him that he wouldmarry her and she would be his life.Gradually, even without seeing her, he came to know her."
3510,2,"He would haveliked to think of her as of something given into his protection, like achild without parents."
3511,2,But it was forbidden him.
3512,2,He had to come downfrom this pleasant view of the case.
3513,2,She might refuse him.
3514,2,"And besides,he was afraid of her.But during the long February nights with the ewes in labour, lookingout from the shelter into the flashing stars, he knew he did not belongto himself."
3515,2,"He must admit that he was only fragmentary, somethingincomplete and subject."
3516,2,"There were the stars in the dark heaventravelling, the whole host passing by on some eternal voyage."
3517,2,"So he satsmall and submissive to the greater ordering.Unless she would come to him, he must remain as a nothingness."
3518,2,It was ahard experience.
3519,2,"But, after her repeated obliviousness to him, after hehad seen so often that he did not exist for her, after he had raged andtried to escape, and said he was good enough by himself, he was a man,and could stand alone, he must, in the starry multiplicity of the nighthumble himself, and admit and know that without her he was nothing.He was nothing."
3520,2,"But with her, he would be real."
3521,2,"If she were now walkingacross the frosty grass near the sheep-shelter, through the fretfulbleating of the ewes and lambs, she would bring him completeness andperfection."
3522,2,"And if it should be so, that she should come to him! Itshould be so-it was ordained so.He was a long time resolving definitely to ask her to marry him."
3523,2,"And heknew, if he asked her, she must really acquiesce."
3524,2,"She must, it couldnot be otherwise.He had learned a little of her."
3525,2,"She was poor, quite alone, and had hada hard time in London, both before and after her husband died."
3526,2,"But inPoland she was a lady well born, a landowner's daughter.All these things were only words to him, the fact of her superiorbirth, the fact that her husband had been a brilliant doctor, the factthat he himself was her inferior in almost every way of distinction.There was an inner reality, a logic of the soul, which connected herwith him.One evening in March, when the wind was roaring outside, came themoment to ask her."
3527,2,"He had sat with his hands before him, leaning to thefire."
3528,2,"And as he watched the fire, he knew almost without thinking thathe was going this evening.""Have you got a clean shirt?"" he asked Tilly.""You know you've got clean shirts,"" she said.""Ay,-bring me a white one.""Tilly brought down one of the linen shirts he had inherited from hisfather, putting it before him to air at the fire."
3529,2,"She loved him with adumb, aching love as he sat leaning with his arms on his knees, stilland absorbed, unaware of her."
3530,2,"Lately, a quivering inclination to cryhad come over her, when she did anything for him in his presence."
3531,2,Nowher hands trembled as she spread the shirt.
3532,2,He was never shouting andteasing now.
3533,2,The deep stillness there was in the house made hertremble.He went to wash himself.
3534,2,"Queer little breaks of consciousness seemed torise and burst like bubbles out of the depths of his stillness.""It's got to be done,"" he said as he stoo."
3535,2,"Ursula and Gudrun Brangwen sat one morning in the window-bay of theirfather's house in Beldover, working and talking."
3536,2,"Ursula was stitching apiece of brightly-coloured embroidery, and Gudrun was drawing upon aboard which she held on her knee."
3537,2,"They were mostly silent, talking astheir thoughts strayed through their minds.'Ursula,' said Gudrun, 'don't you REALLY WANT to get married?' Ursulalaid her embroidery in her lap and looked up."
3538,2,"Her face was calm andconsiderate.'I don't know,' she replied."
3539,2,'It depends how you mean.'Gudrun was slightly taken aback.
3540,2,"She watched her sister for somemoments.'Well,' she said, ironically, 'it usually means one thing! But don'tyou think anyhow, you'd be--' she darkened slightly--'in a betterposition than you are in now.'A shadow came over Ursula's face.'I might,' she said."
3541,2,"'But I'm not sure.'Again Gudrun paused, slightly irritated."
3542,2,"She wanted to be quitedefinite.'You don't think one needs the EXPERIENCE of having been married?' sheasked.'Do you think it need BE an experience?' replied Ursula.'Bound to be, in some way or other,' said Gudrun, coolly."
3543,2,"'Possiblyundesirable, but bound to be an experience of some sort.''Not really,' said Ursula."
3544,2,"'More likely to be the end of experience.'Gudrun sat very still, to attend to this.'Of course,' she said, 'there's THAT to consider.' This brought theconversation to a close."
3545,2,"Gudrun, almost angrily, took up her rubber andbegan to rub out part of her drawing."
3546,2,"Ursula stitched absorbedly.'You wouldn't consider a good offer?' asked Gudrun.'I think I've rejected several,' said Ursula.'REALLY!' Gudrun flushed dark--'But anything really worth while? Haveyou REALLY?''A thousand a year, and an awfully nice man."
3547,2,"I liked him awfully,' saidUrsula.'Really! But weren't you fearfully tempted?''In the abstract but not in the concrete,' said Ursula."
3548,2,"'When it comesto the point, one isn't even tempted--oh, if I were tempted, I'd marrylike a shot."
3549,2,"I'm only tempted NOT to.' The faces of both sisterssuddenly lit up with amusement.'Isn't it an amazing thing,' cried Gudrun, 'how strong the temptationis, not to!' They both laughed, looking at each other."
3550,2,"In their heartsthey were frightened.There was a long pause, whilst Ursula stitched and Gudrun went on withher sketch."
3551,2,"The sisters were women, Ursula twenty-six, and Gudruntwenty-five."
3552,2,"But both had the remote, virgin look of modern girls,sisters of Artemis rather than of Hebe."
3553,2,"Gudrun was very beautiful,passive, soft-skinned, soft-limbed."
3554,2,"She wore a dress of dark-blue silkystuff, with ruches of blue and green linen lace in the neck andsleeves; and she had emerald-green stockings."
3555,2,Her look of confidenceand diffidence contrasted with Ursula's sensitive expectancy.
3556,2,"Theprovincial people, intimidated by Gudrun's perfect sang-froid andexclusive bareness of manner, said of her: 'She is a smart woman.' Shehad just come back from London, where she had spent several years,working at an art-school, as a student, and living a studio life.'I was hoping now for a man to come along,' Gudrun said, suddenlycatching her underlip between her teeth, and making a strange grimace,half sly smiling, half anguish."
3557,2,"Ursula was afraid.'So you have come home, expecting him here?' she laughed.'Oh my dear,' cried Gudrun, strident, 'I wouldn't go out of my way tolook for him."
3558,2,But if there did happen to come along a highly attractiveindividual of sufficient means--well--' she tailed off ironically.
3559,2,"Thenshe looked searchingly at Ursula, as if to probe her."
3560,2,'Don't you findyourself getting bored?' she asked of her sister.
3561,2,"'Don't you find, thatthings fail to materialise? NOTHING MATERIALISES! Everything withers inthe bud.''What withers in the bud?' asked Ursula.'Oh, everything--oneself--things in general.' There was a pause, whilsteach sister vaguely considered her fate.'It does frighten one,' said Ursula, and again there was a pause."
3562,2,"'Butdo you hope to get anywhere by just marrying?''It seems to be the inevitable next step,' said Gudrun."
3563,2,"Ursula ponderedthis, with a little bitterness."
3564,2,"She was a class mistress herself, inWilley Green Grammar School, as she had been for some years.'I know,' she said, 'it seems like that when one thinks in theabstract."
3565,2,"But really imagine it: imagine any man one knows, imagine himcoming home to one every evening, and saying ""Hello,"" and giving one akiss--'There was a blank pause.'Yes,' said Gudrun, in a narrowed voice."
3566,2,'It's just impossible.
3567,2,"The manmakes it impossible.''Of course there's children--' said Ursula doubtfully.Gudrun's face hardened.'Do you REALLY want children, Ursula?' she asked coldly."
3568,2,"A dazzled,baffled look came on Ursula's face.'One feels it is still beyond one,' she said.'DO you feel like that?' asked Gudrun."
3569,2,"'I get no feeling whatever fromthe thought of bearing children.'Gudrun looked at Ursula with a masklike, expressionless face."
3570,2,"Ursulaknitted her brows.'Perhaps it isn't genuine,' she faltered."
3571,2,"'Perhaps one doesn't reallywant them, in one's soul--only superficially.' A hardness came overGudrun's face."
3572,2,"She did not want to be too definite.'When one thinks of other people's children--' said Ursula.Again Gudrun looked at her sister, almost hostile.'Exactly,' she said, to close the conversation.The two sisters worked on in silence, Ursula having always that strangebrightness of an essential flame that is caught, meshed, contravened.She lived a good deal by herself, to herself, working, passing on fromday to day, and always thinking, trying to lay hold on life, to graspit in her own understanding."
3573,2,"Her active living was suspended, butunderneath, in the darkness, something was coming to pass."
3574,2,"If only shecould break through the last integuments! She seemed to try and put herhands out, like an infant in the womb, and she could not, not yet.Still she had a strange prescience, an intimation of something yet tocome.She laid down her work and looked at her sister."
3575,2,"She thought Gudrun soCHARMING, so infinitely charming, in her softness and her fine,exquisite richness of texture and delicacy of line."
3576,2,"There was a certainplayfulness about her too, such a piquancy or ironic suggestion, suchan untouched reserve."
3577,2,"Ursula admired her with all her soul.'Why did you come home, Prune?' she asked.Gudrun knew she was being admired."
3578,2,"She sat back from her drawing andlooked at Ursula, from under her finely-curved lashes.'Why did I come back, Ursula?' she repeated."
3579,2,"'I have asked myself athousand times.''And don't you know?''Yes, I think I do."
3580,2,"I think my coming back home was just RECULER POURMIEUX SAUTER.'And she looked with a long, slow look of knowledge at Ursula.'I know!' cried Ursula, looking slightly dazzled and falsified, and asif she did NOT know."
3581,2,"'But where can one jump to?''Oh, it doesn't matter,' said Gudrun, somewhat superbly."
3582,2,"'If one jumpsover the edge, one is bound to land somewhere.''But isn't it very risky?' asked Ursula.A slow mocking smile dawned on Gudrun's face.'Ah!' she said laughing."
3583,2,'What is it all but words!' And so again sheclosed the conversation.
3584,2,"But Ursula was still brooding.'And how do you find home, now you have come back to it?' she asked.Gudrun paused for some moments, coldly, before answering."
3585,2,"Then, in acold truthful voice, she said:'I find myself completely out of it.''And father?'Gudrun looked at Ursula, almost with resentment, as if brought to bay.'I haven't thought about him: I've refrained,' she said coldly.'Yes,' wavered Ursula; and the conversation was really at an end."
3586,2,"Thesisters found themselves confronted by a void, a terrifying chasm, asif they had looked over the edge.They worked on in silence for some time, Gudrun's cheek was flushedwith repressed emotion."
3587,2,"She resented its having been called into being.'Shall we go out and look at that wedding?' she asked at length, in avoice that was too casual.'Yes!' cried Ursula, too eagerly, throwing aside her sewing and leapingup, as if to escape something, thus betraying the tension of thesituation and causing a friction of dislike to go over Gudrun's nerves.As she went upstairs, Ursula was aware of the house, of her home roundabout her."
3588,2,"And she loathed it, the sordid, too-familiar place! She wasafraid at the depth of her feeling against the home, the milieu, thewhole atmosphere and condition of this obsolete life."
3589,2,"Her feelingfrightened her.The two girls were soon walking swiftly down the main road of Beldover,a wide street, part shops, part dwelling-houses, utterly formless andsordid, without poverty."
3590,2,"Gudrun, new from her life in Chelsea andSussex, shrank cruelly from this amorphous ugliness of a small collierytown in the Midlands."
3591,2,"Yet forward she went, through the whole sordidgamut of pettiness, the long amorphous, gritty street."
3592,2,"She was exposedto every stare, she passed on through a stretch of torment."
3593,2,"It wasstrange that she should have chosen to come back and test the fulleffect of this shapeless, barren ugliness upon herself."
3594,2,"Why had shewanted to submit herself to it, did she still want to submit herself toit, the insufferable torture of these ugly, meaningless people, thisdefaced countryside? She felt like a beetle toiling in the dust."
3595,2,"Shewas filled with repulsion.They turned off the main road, past a black patch of common-garden,where sooty cabbage stumps stood shameless."
3596,2,No one thought to beashamed.
3597,2,"No one was ashamed of it all.'It is like a country in an underworld,' said Gudrun."
3598,2,"'The colliersbring it above-ground with them, shovel it up."
3599,2,"Ursula, it's marvellous,it's really marvellous--it's really wonderful, another world."
3600,2,"Thepeople are all ghouls, and everything is ghostly."
3601,2,"Everything is aghoulish replica of the real world, a replica, a ghoul, all soiled,everything sordid."
3602,2,"It's like being mad, Ursula.'The sisters were crossing a black path through a dark, soiled field."
3603,2,"Onthe left was a large landscape, a valley with collieries, and oppositehills with cornfields and woods, all blackened with distance, as ifseen through a veil of crape."
3604,2,"White and black smoke rose up in steadycolumns, magic within the dark air."
3605,2,"Near at hand came the long rows ofdwellings, approaching curved up the hill-slope, in straight linesalong the brow of the hill."
3606,2,"They were of darkened red brick, brittle,with dark slate roofs."
3607,2,"The path on which the sisters walked was black,trodden-in by the feet of the recurrent colliers, and bounded from thefield by iron fences; the stile that led again into the road was rubbedshiny by the moleskins of the passing miners."
3608,2,"Now the two girls weregoing between some rows of dwellings, of the poorer sort."
3609,2,"Women, theirarms folded over their coarse aprons, standing gossiping at the end oftheir block, stared after the Brangwen sisters with that long,unwearying stare of aborigines; children called out names.Gudrun went on her way half dazed."
3610,2,"If this were human life, if thesewere human beings, living in a complete world, then what was her ownworld, outside? She was aware of her grass-green stockings, her largegrass-green velour hat, her full soft coat, of a strong blue colour.And she felt as if she were treading in the air, quite unstable, herheart was contracted, as if at any minute she might be precipitated tothe ground."
3611,2,"She was afraid.She clung to Ursula, who, through long usage was inured to thisviolation of a dark, uncreated, hostile world."
3612,2,"But all the time herheart was crying, as if in the midst of some ordeal: 'I want to goback, I want to go away, I want not to know it, not to know that thisexists.' Yet she must go forward.Ursula could feel her suffering.'You hate this, don't you?' she asked.'It bewilders me,' stammered Gudrun.'You won't stay long,' replied Ursula.And Gudrun went along, grasping at release.They drew away from the colliery region, over the curve of the hill,into the purer country of the other side, towards Willey Green."
3613,2,"Stillthe faint glamour of blackness persisted over the fields and the woodedhills, and seemed darkly to gleam in the air."
3614,2,"It was a spring day,chill, with snatches of sunshine."
3615,2,"Yellow celandines showed out from thehedge-bottoms, and in the cottage gardens of Willey Green,currant-bushes were breaking into leaf, and little flowers were comingwhite on the grey alyssum that hung over the stone walls.Turning, they passed down the high-road, that went between high bankstowards the church."
3616,2,"There, in the lowest bend of the road, low underthe trees, stood a little group of expectant people, waiting to see thewedding."
3617,2,"The daughter of the chief mine-owner of the district, ThomasCrich, was getting married to a naval officer.'Let us go back,' said Gudrun, swerving away."
3618,2,"'There are all thosepeople.'And she hung wavering in the road.'Never mind them,' said Ursula, 'they're all right."
3619,2,"They all know me,they don't matter.''But must we go through them?' asked Gudrun.'They're quite all right, really,' said Ursula, going forward."
3620,2,"Andtogether the two sisters approached the group of uneasy, watchfulcommon people."
3621,2,"They were chiefly women, colliers' wives of the moreshiftless sort."
3622,2,"They had watchful, underworld faces.The two sisters held themselves tense, and went straight towards thegate."
3623,2,"The women made way for them, but barely sufficient, as ifgrudging to yield ground."
3624,2,"The sisters passed in silence through thestone gateway and up the steps, on the red carpet, a policemanestimating their progress.'What price the stockings!' said a voice at the back of Gudrun."
3625,2,"Asudden fierce anger swept over the girl, violent and murderous."
3626,2,"Shewould have liked them all annihilated, cleared away, so that the worldwas left clear for her."
3627,2,"How she hated walking up the churchyard path,along the red carpet, continuing in motion, in their sight.'I won't go into the church,' she said suddenly, with such finaldecision that Ursula immediately halted, turned round, and branched offup a small side path which led to the little private gate of theGrammar School, whose grounds adjoined those of the church.Just inside the gate of the school shrubbery, outside the churchyard,Ursula sat down for a moment on the low stone wall under the laurelbushes, to rest."
3628,2,"Behind her, the large red building of the school roseup peacefully, the windows all open for the holiday."
3629,2,"Over the shrubs,before her, were the pale roofs and tower of the old church."
3630,2,Thesisters were hidden by the foliage.Gudrun sat down in silence.
3631,2,"Her mouth was shut close, her face averted.She was regretting bitterly that she had ever come back."
3632,2,"Ursula lookedat her, and thought how amazingly beautiful she was, flushed withdiscomfiture."
3633,2,"But she caused a constraint over Ursula's nature, acertain weariness."
3634,2,"Ursula wished to be alone, freed from the tightness,the enclosure of Gudrun's presence.'Are we going to stay here?' asked Gudrun.'I was only resting a minute,' said Ursula, getting up as if rebuked.'We will stand in the corner by the fives-court, we shall seeeverything from there.'For the moment, the sunshine fell brightly into the churchyard, therewas a vague scent of sap and of spring, perhaps of violets from off thegraves."
3635,2,"Some white daisies were out, bright as angels."
3636,2,"In the air, theunfolding leaves of a copper-beech were blood-red.Punctually at eleven o'clock, the carriages began to arrive."
3637,2,"There wasa stir in the crowd at the gate, a concentration as a carriage droveup, wedding guests were mounting up the steps and passing along the redcarpet to the church."
3638,2,"They were all gay and excited because the sun wasshining.Gudrun watched them closely, with objective curiosity."
3639,2,"She saw each oneas a complete figure, like a character in a book, or a subject in apicture, or a marionette in a theatre, a finished creation."
3640,2,"She lovedto recognise their various characteristics, to place them in their truelight, give them their own surroundings, settle them for ever as theypassed before her along the path to the church."
3641,2,"She knew them, theywere finished, sealed and stamped and finished with, for her."
3642,2,"There wasnone that had anything unknown, unresolved, until the Crichesthemselves began to appear."
3643,2,Then her interest was piqued.
3644,2,"Here wassomething not quite so preconcluded.There came the mother, Mrs Crich, with her eldest son Gerald."
3645,2,"She was aqueer unkempt figure, in spite of the attempts that had obviously beenmade to bring her into line for the day."
3646,2,"Her face was pale, yellowish,with a clear, transparent skin, she leaned forward rather, her featureswere strongly marked, handsome, with a tense, unseeing, predative look.Her colourless hair was untidy, wisps floating down on to her sac coatof dark blue silk, from under her blue silk hat."
3647,2,"She looked like awoman with a monomania, furtive almost, but heavily proud.Her son was of a fair, sun-tanned type, rather above middle height,well-made, and almost exaggeratedly well-dressed."
3648,2,"But about him alsowas the strange, guarded look, the unconscious glisten, as if he didnot belong to the same creation as the people about him."
3649,2,Gudrun lightedon him at once.
3650,2,There was something northern about him that magnetisedher.
3651,2,In his clear northern flesh and his fair hair was a glisten likesunshine refracted through crystals of ice.
3652,2,"And he looked so new,unbroached, pure as an arctic thing."
3653,2,"Perhaps he was thirty years old,perhaps more."
3654,2,"His gleaming beauty, maleness, like a young,good-humoured, smiling wolf, did not blind her to the significant,sinister stillness in his bearing, the lurking danger of his unsubduedtemper."
3655,2,"'His totem is the wolf,' she repeated to herself."
3656,2,"'His motheris an old, unbroken wolf.' And then she experienced a keen paroxyism, atransport, as if she had made some incredible discovery, known tonobody else on earth."
3657,2,"A strange transport took possession of her, allher veins were in a paroxysm of violent sensation."
3658,2,"'Good God!' sheexclaimed to herself, 'what is this?' And then, a moment after, she wassaying assuredly, 'I shall know more of that man.' She was torturedwith desire to see him again, a nostalgia, a necessity to see himagain, to make sure it was not all a mistake, that she was not deludingherself, that she really felt this strange and overwhelming sensationon his account, this knowledge of him in her essence, this powerfulapprehension of him."
3659,2,"'Am I REALLY singled out for him in some way, isthere really some pale gold, arctic light that envelopes only us two?'she asked herself."
3660,2,"And she could not believe it, she remained in amuse, scarcely conscious of what was going on around.The bridesmaids were here, and yet the bridegroom had not come."
3661,2,"Ursulawondered if something was amiss, and if the wedding would yet all gowrong."
3662,2,"She felt troubled, as if it rested upon her."
3663,2,The chiefbridesmaids had arrived.
3664,2,Ursula watched them come up the steps.
3665,2,"One ofthem she knew, a tall, slow, reluctant woman with a weight of fair hairand a pale, long face."
3666,2,"This was Hermione Roddice, a friend of theCriches."
3667,2,"Now she came along, with her head held up, balancing anenormous flat hat of pale yellow velvet, on which were streaks ofostrich feathers, natural and grey."
3668,2,"She drifted forward as if scarcelyconscious, her long blanched face lifted up, not to see the world."
3669,2,Shewas rich.
3670,2,"She wore a dress of silky, frail velvet, of pale yellowcolour, and she carried a lot of small rose-coloured cyclamens."
3671,2,"Hershoes and stockings were of brownish grey, like the feathers on herhat, her hair was heavy, she drifted along with a peculiar fixity ofthe hips, a strange unwilling motion."
3672,2,"She was impressive, in her lovelypale-yellow and brownish-rose, yet macabre, something repulsive."
3673,2,"Peoplewere silent when she passed, impressed, roused, wanting to jeer, yetfor some reason silenced."
3674,2,"Her long, pale face, that she carried liftedup, somewhat in the Rossetti fashion, seemed almost drugged, as if astrange mass of thoughts coiled in the darkness within her, and she wasnever allowed to escape.Ursula watched her with fascination."
3675,2,She knew her a little.
3676,2,She was themost remarkable woman in the Midlands.
3677,2,"Her father was a DerbyshireBaronet of the old school, she was a woman of the new school, full ofintellectuality, and heavy, nerve-worn with consciousness."
3678,2,"She waspassionately interested in reform, her soul was given up to the publiccause."
3679,2,"But she was a man's woman, it was the manly world that held her.She had various intimacies of mind and soul with various men ofcapacity."
3680,2,"Ursula knew, among these men, only Rupert Birkin, who was oneof the school-inspectors of the county."
3681,2,"But Gudrun had met others, inLondon."
3682,2,"Moving with her artist friends in different kinds of society,Gudrun had already come to know a good many people of repute andstanding."
3683,2,"She had met Hermione twice, but they did not take to eachother."
3684,2,"It would be queer to meet again down here in the Midlands, wheretheir social standing was so diverse, after they had known each otheron terms of equality in the houses of sundry acquaintances in town."
3685,2,"ForGudrun had been a social success, and had her friends among the slackaristocracy that keeps touch with the arts.Hermione knew herself to be well-dressed; she knew herself to be thesocial equal, if not far the superior, of anyone she was likely to meetin Willey Green."
3686,2,She knew she was accepted in the world of culture andof intellect.
3687,2,"She was a KULTURTRAGER, a medium for the culture ofideas."
3688,2,"With all that was highest, whether in society or in thought orin public action, or even in art, she was at one, she moved among theforemost, at home with them."
3689,2,"No one could put her down, no one couldmake mock of her, because she stood among the first, and those thatwere against her were below her, either in rank, or in wealth, or inhigh association of thought and progress and understanding."
3690,2,"So, she wasinvulnerable."
3691,2,"All her life, she had sought to make herselfinvulnerable, unassailable, beyond reach of the world's judgment.And yet her soul was tortured, exposed."
3692,2,"Even walking up the path to thechurch, confident as she was that in every respect she stood beyond allvulgar judgment, knowing perfectly that her appearance was complete andperfect, according to the first standards, yet she suffered a torture,under her confidence and her pride, feeling herself exposed to woundsand to mockery and to despite."
3693,2,"She always felt vulnerable, vulnerable,there was always a secret chink in her armour."
3694,2,She did not know herselfwhat it was.
3695,2,"It was a lack of robust self, she had no naturalsufficiency, there was a terrible void, a lack, a deficiency of beingwithin her.And she wanted someone to close up this deficiency, to close it up forever."
3696,2,She craved for Rupert Birkin.
3697,2,"When he was there, she feltcomplete, she was sufficient, whole."
3698,2,"For the rest of time she wasestablished on the sand, built over a chasm, and, in spite of all hervanity and securities, any common maid-servant of positive, robusttemper could fling her down this bottomless pit of insufficiency, bythe slightest movement of jeering or contempt."
3699,2,"And all the while thepensive, tortured woman piled up her own defences of aestheticknowledge, and culture, and world-visions, and disinterestedness."
3700,2,"Yetshe could never stop up the terrible gap of insufficiency.If only Birkin would form a close and abiding connection with her, shewould be safe during this fretful voyage of life."
3701,2,"He could make hersound and triumphant, triumphant over the very angels of heaven."
3702,2,"Ifonly he would do it! But she was tortured with fear, with misgiving.She made herself beautiful, she strove so hard to come to that degreeof beauty and advantage, when he should be convinced."
3703,2,But always therewas a deficiency.He was perverse too.
3704,2,"He fought her off, he always fought her off."
3705,2,"Themore she strove to bring him to her, the more he battled her back."
3706,2,"Andthey had been lovers now, for years."
3707,2,"Oh, it was so wearying, so aching;she was so tired."
3708,2,But still she believed in herself.
3709,2,She knew he wastrying to leave her.
3710,2,"She knew he was trying to break away from herfinally, to be free."
3711,2,"But still she believed in her strength to keephim, she believed in her own higher knowledge."
3712,2,"His own knowledge washigh, she was the central touchstone of truth."
3713,2,"She only needed hisconjunction with her.And this, this conjunction with her, which was his highest fulfilmentalso, with the perverseness of a wilful child he wanted to deny."
3714,2,"Withthe wilfulness of an obstinate child, he wanted to break the holyconnection that was between them.He would be at this wedding; he was to be groom's man."
3715,2,"He would be inthe church, waiting."
3716,2,He would know when she came.
3717,2,She shuddered withnervous apprehension and desire as she went through the church-door.
3718,2,"Hewould be there, surely he would see how beautiful her dress was, surelyhe would see how she had made herself beautiful for him."
3719,2,"He wouldunderstand, he would be able to see how she was made for him, thefirst, how she was, for him, the highest."
3720,2,"Surely at last he would beable to accept his highest fate, he would not deny her.In a little convulsion of too-tired yearning, she entered the churchand looked slowly along her cheeks for him, her slender body convulsedwith agitation."
3721,2,"As best man, he would be standing beside the altar."
3722,2,"Shelooked slowly, deferring in her certainty.And then, he was not there."
3723,2,"A terrible storm came over her, as if shewere drowning."
3724,2,She was possessed by a devastating hopelessness.
3725,2,And sheapproached mechanically to the altar.
3726,2,Never had she known such a pangof utter and final hopelessness.
3727,2,"It was beyond death, so utterly null,desert.The bridegroom and the groom's man had not yet come."
3728,2,There was agrowing consternation outside.
3729,2,Ursula felt almost responsible.
3730,2,"Shecould not bear it that the bride should arrive, and no groom."
3731,2,"Thewedding must not be a fiasco, it must not.But here was the bride's carriage, adorned with ribbons and cockades.Gaily the grey horses curvetted to their destination at thechurch-gate, a laughter in the whole movement."
3732,2,Here was the quick ofall laughter and pleasure.
3733,2,"The door of the carriage was thrown open, tolet out the very blossom of the day."
3734,2,"The people on the roadway murmuredfaintly with the discontented murmuring of a crowd.The father stepped out first into the air of the morning, like ashadow."
3735,2,"He was a tall, thin, careworn man, with a thin black beard thatwas touched with grey."
3736,2,"He waited at the door of the carriage patiently,self-obliterated.In the opening of the doorway was a shower of fine foliage and flowers,a whiteness of satin and lace, and a sound of a gay voice saying:'How do I get out?'A ripple of satisfaction ran through the expectant people."
3737,2,"They pressednear to receive her, looking with zest at the stooping blond head withits flower buds, and at the delicate, white, tentative foot that wasreaching down to the step of the carriage."
3738,2,"There was a sudden foamingrush, and the bride like a sudden surf-rush, floating all white besideher father in the morning shadow of trees, her veil flowing withlaughter.'That's done it!' she said.She put her hand on the arm of her care-worn, sallow father, andfrothing her light draperies, proceeded over the eternal red carpet.Her father, mute and yellowish, his black beard making him look morecareworn, mounted the steps stiffly, as if his spirit were absent; butthe laughing mist of the bride went along with him undiminished.And no bridegroom had arrived! It was intolerable for her."
3739,2,"Ursula, herheart strained with anxiety, was watching the hill beyond; the white,descending road, that should give sight of him."
3740,2,There was a carriage.It was running.
3741,2,It had just come into sight.
3742,2,"Yes, it was he."
3743,2,"Ursulaturned towards the bride and the people, and, from her place ofvantage, gave an inarticulate cry."
3744,2,She wanted to warn them that he wascoming.
3745,2,"But her cry was inarticulate and inaudible, and she flusheddeeply, between her desire and her wincing confusion.The carriage rattled down the hill, and drew near."
3746,2,There was a shoutfrom the people.
3747,2,"The bride, who had just reached the top of the steps,turned round gaily to see what was the commotion."
3748,2,"She saw a confusionamong the people, a cab pulling up, and her lover dropping out of thecarriage, and dodging among the horses and into the crowd.'Tibs! Tibs!' she cried in her sudden, mocking excitement, standinghigh on the path in the sunlight and waving her bouquet."
3749,2,"He, dodgingwith his hat in his hand, had not heard.'Tibs!' she cried again, looking down to him.He glanced up, unaware, and saw the bride and her father standing onthe path above him."
3750,2,"A queer, startled look went over his face."
3751,2,Hehesitated for a moment.
3752,2,"Then he gathered himself together for a leap,to overtake her.'Ah-h-h!' came her strange, intaken cry, as, on the reflex, shestarted, turned and fled, scudding with an unthinkable swift beating ofher white feet and fraying of her white garments, towards the church.Like a hound the young man was after her, leaping the steps andswinging past her father, his supple haunches working like those of ahound that bears down on the quarry.'Ay, after her!' cried the vulgar women below, carried suddenly intothe sport.She, her flowers shaken from her like froth, was steadying herself toturn the angle of the church."
3753,2,"She glanced behind, and with a wild cryof laughter and challenge, veered, poised, and was gone beyond the greystone buttress."
3754,2,"In another instant the bridegroom, bent forward as heran, had caught the angle of the silent stone with his hand, and hadswung himself out of sight, his supple, strong loins vanishing inpursuit.Instantly cries and exclamations of excitement burst from the crowd atthe gate."
3755,2,"And then Ursula noticed again the dark, rather stoopingfigure of Mr Crich, waiting suspended on the path, watching withexpressionless face the flight to the church."
3756,2,"It was over, and heturned round to look behind him, at the figure of Rupert Birkin, who atonce came forward and joined him.'We'll bring up the rear,' said Birkin, a faint smile on his face.'Ay!' replied the father laconically."
3757,2,"And the two men turned togetherup the path.Birkin was as thin as Mr Crich, pale and ill-looking."
3758,2,His figure wasnarrow but nicely made.
3759,2,"He went with a slight trail of one foot, whichcame only from self-consciousness."
3760,2,"Although he was dressed correctlyfor his part, yet there was an innate incongruity which caused a slightridiculousness in his appearance."
3761,2,"His nature was clever and separate,he did not fit at all in the conventional occasion."
3762,2,"Yet he subordinatedhimself to the common idea, travestied himself.He affected to be quite ordinary, perfectly and marvellouslycommonplace."
3763,2,"And he did it so well, taking the tone of hissurroundings, adjusting himself quickly to his interlocutor and hiscircumstance, that he achieved a verisimilitude of ordinarycommonplaceness that usually propitiated his onlookers for the moment,disarmed them from attacking his singleness.Now he spoke quite easily and pleasantly to Mr Crich, as they walkedalong the path; he played with situations like a man on a tight-rope:but always on a tight-rope, pretending nothing but ease.'I'm sorry we are so late,' he was saying."
3764,2,"'We couldn't find abutton-hook, so it took us a long time to button our boots."
3765,2,"But youwere to the moment.''We are usually to time,' said Mr Crich.'And I'm always late,' said Birkin."
3766,2,"'But today I was REALLY punctual,only accidentally not so."
3767,2,"I'm sorry.'The two men were gone, there was nothing more to see, for the time.Ursula was left thinking about Birkin."
3768,2,"He piqued her, attracted her,and annoyed her.She wanted to know him more."
3769,2,"She had spoken with him once or twice, butonly in his official capacity as inspector."
3770,2,"She thought he seemed toacknowledge some kinship between her and him, a natural, tacitunderstanding, a using of the same language."
3771,2,But there had been no timefor the understanding to develop.
3772,2,"And something kept her from him, aswell as attracted her to him."
3773,2,"There was a certain hostility, a hiddenultimate reserve in him, cold and inaccessible.Yet she wanted to know him.'What do you think of Rupert Birkin?' she asked, a little reluctantly,of Gudrun."
3774,2,She did not want to discuss him.'What do I think of Rupert Birkin?' repeated Gudrun.
3775,2,'I think he'sattractive--decidedly attractive.
3776,2,What I can't stand about him is hisway with other people--his way of treating any little fool as if shewere his greatest consideration.
3777,2,"One feels so awfully sold, oneself.''Why does he do it?' said Ursula.'Because he has no real critical faculty--of people, at all events,'said Gudrun."
3778,2,"'I tell you, he treats any little fool as he treats me oryou--and it's such an insult.''Oh, it is,' said Ursula."
3779,2,"'One must discriminate.''One MUST discriminate,' repeated Gudrun."
3780,2,"'But he's a wonderful chap,in other respects--a marvellous personality."
3781,2,"But you can't trust him.''Yes,' said Ursula vaguely."
3782,2,"She was always forced to assent to Gudrun'spronouncements, even when she was not in accord altogether.The sisters sat silent, waiting for the wedding party to come out.Gudrun was impatient of talk."
3783,2,"She wanted to think about Gerald Crich.She wanted to see if the strong feeling she had got from him was real.She wanted to have herself ready.Inside the church, the wedding was going on."
3784,2,Hermione Roddice wasthinking only of Birkin.
3785,2,He stood near her.
3786,2,She seemed to gravitatephysically towards him.
3787,2,She wanted to stand touching him.
3788,2,"She couldhardly be sure he was near her, if she did not touch him."
3789,2,"Yet she stoodsubjected through the wedding service.She had suffered so bitterly when he did not come, that still she wasdazed."
3790,2,"Still she was gnawed as by a neuralgia, tormented by hispotential absence from her."
3791,2,She had awaited him in a faint delirium ofnervous torture.
3792,2,"As she stood bearing herself pensively, the rapt lookon her face, that seemed spiritual, like the angels, but which camefrom torture, gave her a certain poignancy that tore his heart withpity."
3793,2,"He saw her bowed head, her rapt face, the face of an almostdemoniacal ecstatic."
3794,2,"Feeling him looking, she lifted her face andsought his eyes, her own beautiful grey eyes flaring him a greatsignal."
3795,2,"But he avoided her look, she sank her head in torment andshame, the gnawing at her heart going on."
3796,2,"And he too was tortured withshame, and ultimate dislike, and with acute pity for her, because hedid not want to meet her eyes, he did not want to receive her flare ofrecognition.The bride and bridegroom were married, the party went into the vestry.Hermione crowded involuntarily up against Birkin, to touch him."
3797,2,"And heendured it.Outside, Gudrun and Ursula listened for their father's playing on theorgan."
3798,2,He would enjoy playing a wedding march.
3799,2,"Now the married pairwere coming! The bells were ringing, making the air shake."
3800,2,"Ursulawondered if the trees and the flowers could feel the vibration, andwhat they thought of it, this strange motion in the air."
3801,2,"The bride wasquite demure on the arm of the bridegroom, who stared up into the skybefore him, shutting and opening his eyes unconsciously, as if he wereneither here nor there."
3802,2,"He looked rather comical, blinking and tryingto be in the scene, when emotionally he was violated by his exposure toa crowd."
3803,2,"He looked a typical naval officer, manly, and up to his duty.Birkin came with Hermione."
3804,2,"She had a rapt, triumphant look, like thefallen angels restored, yet still subtly demoniacal, now she heldBirkin by the arm."
3805,2,"And he was expressionless, neutralised, possessed byher as if it were his fate, without question.Gerald Crich came, fair, good-looking, healthy, with a great reserve ofenergy."
3806,2,"He was erect and complete, there was a strange stealthglistening through his amiable, almost happy appearance."
3807,2,Gudrun rosesharply and went away.
3808,2,She could not bear it.
3809,2,"She wanted to be alone,to know this strange, sharp inoculation that had changed the wholetemper of her blood.CHAPTER II.SHORTLANDSThe Brangwens went home to Beldover, the wedding-party gathered atShortlands, the Criches' home."
3810,2,"It was a long, low old house, a sort ofmanor farm, that spread along the top of a slope just beyond the narrowlittle lake of Willey Water."
3811,2,"Shortlands looked across a sloping meadowthat might be a park, because of the large, solitary trees that stoodhere and there, across the water of the narrow lake, at the wooded hillthat successfully hid the colliery valley beyond, but did not quitehide the rising smoke."
3812,2,"Nevertheless, the scene was rural andpicturesque, very peaceful, and the house had a charm of its own.It was crowded now with the family and the wedding guests."
3813,2,"The father,who was not well, withdrew to rest."
3814,2,Gerald was host.
3815,2,"He stood in thehomely entrance hall, friendly and easy, attending to the men."
3816,2,"Heseemed to take pleasure in his social functions, he smiled, and wasabundant in hospitality.The women wandered about in a little confusion, chased hither andthither by the three married daughters of the house."
3817,2,"All the whilethere could be heard the characteristic, imperious voice of one Crichwoman or another calling 'Helen, come here a minute,' 'Marjory, I wantyou--here.' 'Oh, I say, Mrs Witham--.' There was a great rustling ofskirts, swift glimpses of smartly-dressed women, a child danced throughthe hall and back again, a maidservant came and went hurriedly.Meanwhile the men stood in calm little groups, chatting, smoking,pretending to pay no heed to the rustling animation of the women'sworld."
3818,2,"But they could not really talk, because of the glassy ravel ofwomen's excited, cold laughter and running voices."
3819,2,"They waited, uneasy,suspended, rather bored."
3820,2,"But Gerald remained as if genial and happy,unaware that he was waiting or unoccupied, knowing himself the verypivot of the occasion.Suddenly Mrs Crich came noiselessly into the room, peering about withher strong, clear face."
3821,2,"She was still wearing her hat, and her sac coatof blue silk.'What is it, mother?' said Gerald.'Nothing, nothing!' she answered vaguely."
3822,2,"And she went straight towardsBirkin, who was talking to a Crich brother-in-law.'How do you do, Mr Birkin,' she said, in her low voice, that seemed totake no count of her guests."
3823,2,"She held out her hand to him.'Oh Mrs Crich,' replied Birkin, in his readily-changing voice, 'Icouldn't come to you before.''I don't know half the people here,' she said, in her low voice."
3824,2,Herson-in-law moved uneasily away.'And you don't like strangers?' laughed Birkin.
3825,2,"'I myself can never seewhy one should take account of people, just because they happen to bein the room with one: why SHOULD I know they are there?''Why indeed, why indeed!' said Mrs Crich, in her low, tense voice.'Except that they ARE there."
3826,2,I don't know people whom I find in thehouse.
3827,2,"The children introduce them to me--""Mother, this is MrSo-and-so."" I am no further."
3828,2,What has Mr So-and-so to do with his ownname?--and what have I to do with either him or his name?'She looked up at Birkin.
3829,2,She startled him.
3830,2,"He was flattered too thatshe came to talk to him, for she took hardly any notice of anybody."
3831,2,"Helooked down at her tense clear face, with its heavy features, but hewas afraid to look into her heavy-seeing blue eyes."
3832,2,"He noticed insteadhow her hair looped in slack, slovenly strands over her ratherbeautiful ears, which were not quite clean."
3833,2,Neither was her neckperfectly clean.
3834,2,"Even in that he seemed to belong to her, rather thanto the rest of the company; though, he thought to himself, he wasalways well washed, at any rate at the neck and ears.He smiled faintly, thinking these things."
3835,2,"Yet he was tense, feelingthat he and the elderly, estranged woman were conferring together liketraitors, like enemies within the camp of the other people."
3836,2,"Heresembled a deer, that throws one ear back upon the trail behind, andone ear forward, to know what is ahead.'People don't really matter,' he said, rather unwilling to continue.The mother looked up at him with sudden, dark interrogation, as ifdoubting his sincerity.'How do you mean, MATTER?' she asked sharply.'Not many people are anything at all,' he answered, forced to go deeperthan he wanted to."
3837,2,'They jingle and giggle.
3838,2,It would be much better ifthey were just wiped out.
3839,2,"Essentially, they don't exist, they aren'tthere.'She watched him steadily while he spoke.'But we didn't imagine them,' she said sharply.'There's nothing to imagine, that's why they don't exist.''Well,' she said, 'I would hardly go as far as that."
3840,2,"There they are,whether they exist or no."
3841,2,It doesn't rest with me to decide on theirexistence.
3842,2,I only know that I can't be expected to take count of themall.
3843,2,"You can't expect me to know them, just because they happen to bethere."
3844,2,"As far as I go they might as well not be there.''Exactly,' he replied.'Mightn't they?' she asked again.'Just as well,' he repeated."
3845,2,"And there was a little pause.'Except that they ARE there, and that's a nuisance,' she said."
3846,2,"'Thereare my sons-in-law,' she went on, in a sort of monologue."
3847,2,"'Now Laura'sgot married, there's another."
3848,2,And I really don't know John from Jamesyet.
3849,2,They come up to me and call me mother.
3850,2,"I know what they willsay--""how are you, mother?"" I ought to say, ""I am not your mother, inany sense."" But what is the use? There they are."
3851,2,I have had children ofmy own.
3852,2,"I suppose I know them from another woman's children.''One would suppose so,' he said.She looked at him, somewhat surprised, forgetting perhaps that she wastalking to him."
3853,2,"And she lost her thread.She looked round the room, vaguely."
3854,2,"Birkin could not guess what she waslooking for, nor what she was thinking."
3855,2,"Evidently she noticed her sons.'Are my children all there?' she asked him abruptly.He laughed, startled, afraid perhaps.'I scarcely know them, except Gerald,' he replied.'Gerald!' she exclaimed."
3856,2,'He's the most wanting of them all.
3857,2,"You'dnever think it, to look at him now, would you?''No,' said Birkin.The mother looked across at her eldest son, stared at him heavily forsome time.'Ay,' she said, in an incomprehensible monosyllable, that soundedprofoundly cynical."
3858,2,"Birkin felt afraid, as if he dared not realise."
3859,2,"AndMrs Crich moved away, forgetting him."
3860,2,"But she returned on her traces.'I should like him to have a friend,' she said."
3861,2,"'He has never had afriend.'Birkin looked down into her eyes, which were blue, and watchingheavily."
3862,2,He could not understand them.
3863,2,"'Am I my brother's keeper?' hesaid to himself, almost flippantly.Then he remembered, with a slight shock, that that was Cain's cry."
3864,2,"AndGerald was Cain, if anybody."
3865,2,"Not that he was Cain, either, although hehad slain his brother."
3866,2,"There was such a thing as pure accident, and theconsequences did not attach to one, even though one had killed one'sbrother in such wise."
3867,2,Gerald as a boy had accidentally killed hisbrother.
3868,2,"What then? Why seek to draw a brand and a curse across thelife that had caused the accident? A man can live by accident, and dieby accident."
3869,2,"Or can he not? Is every man's life subject to pureaccident, is it only the race, the genus, the species, that has auniversal reference? Or is this not true, is there no such thing aspure accident? Has EVERYTHING that happens a universal significance?Has it? Birkin, pondering as he stood there, had forgotten Mrs Crich,as she had forgotten him.He did not believe that there was any such thing as accident."
3870,2,"It allhung together, in the deepest sense.Just as he had decided this, one of the Crich daughters came up,saying:'Won't you come and take your hat off, mother dear? We shall be sittingdown to eat in a minute, and it's a formal occasion, darling, isn'tit?' She drew her arm through her mother's, and they went away."
3871,2,Birkinimmediately went to talk to the nearest man.The gong sounded for the luncheon.
3872,2,"The men looked up, but no move wasmade to the dining-room."
3873,2,The women of the house seemed not to feel thatthe sound had meaning for them.
3874,2,Five minutes passed by.
3875,2,"The elderlymanservant, Crowther, appeared in the doorway exasperatedly."
3876,2,He lookedwith appeal at Gerald.
3877,2,"The latter took up a large, curved conch shell,that lay on a shelf, and without reference to anybody, blew ashattering blast."
3878,2,"It was a strange rousing noise, that made the heartbeat."
3879,2,The summons was almost magical.
3880,2,"Everybody came running, as if ata signal."
3881,2,"And then the crowd in one impulse moved to the dining-room.Gerald waited a moment, for his sister to play hostess."
3882,2,He knew hismother would pay no attention to her duties.
3883,2,But his sister merelycrowded to her seat.
3884,2,"Therefore the young man, slightly too dictatorial,directed the guests to their places.There was a moment's lull, as everybody looked at the BORS D'OEUVRESthat were being handed round."
3885,2,"And out of this lull, a girl of thirteenor fourteen, with her long hair down her back, said in a calm,self-possessed voice:'Gerald, you forget father, when you make that unearthly noise.''Do I?' he answered."
3886,2,"And then, to the company, 'Father is lying down,he is not quite well.''How is he, really?' called one of the married daughters, peeping roundthe immense wedding cake that towered up in the middle of the tableshedding its artificial flowers.'He has no pain, but he feels tired,' replied Winifred, the girl withthe hair down her back.The wine was filled, and everybody was talking boisterously."
3887,2,"At the farend of the table sat the mother, with her loosely-looped hair."
3888,2,She hadBirkin for a neighbour.
3889,2,"Sometimes she glanced fiercely down the rows offaces, bending forwards and staring unceremoniously."
3890,2,"And she would sayin a low voice to Birkin:'Who is that young man?''I don't know,' Birkin answered discreetly.'Have I seen him before?' she asked.'I don't think so."
3891,2,"I haven't,' he replied."
3892,2,And she was satisfied.
3893,2,"Hereyes closed wearily, a peace came over her face, she looked like aqueen in repose."
3894,2,"Then she started, a little social smile came on herface, for a moment she looked the pleasant hostess."
3895,2,"For a moment shebent graciously, as if everyone were welcome and delightful."
3896,2,"And thenimmediately the shadow came back, a sullen, eagle look was on her face,she glanced from under her brows like a sinister creature at bay,hating them all.'Mother,' called Diana, a handsome girl a little older than Winifred,'I may have wine, mayn't I?''Yes, you may have wine,' replied the mother automatically, for she wasperfectly indifferent to the question.And Diana beckoned to the footman to fill her glass.'Gerald shouldn't forbid me,' she said calmly, to the company at large.'All right, Di,' said her brother amiably."
3897,2,"And she glanced challenge athim as she drank from her glass.There was a strange freedom, that almost amounted to anarchy, in thehouse."
3898,2,"It was rather a resistance to authority, than liberty."
3899,2,"Geraldhad some command, by mere force of personality, not because of anygranted position."
3900,2,"There was a quality in his voice, amiable butdominant, that cowed the others, who were all younger than he.Hermione was having a discussion with the bridegroom about nationality.'No,' she said, 'I think that the appeal to patriotism is a mistake."
3901,2,"Itis like one house of business rivalling another house of business.''Well you can hardly say that, can you?' exclaimed Gerald, who had areal PASSION for discussion."
3902,2,"'You couldn't call a race a businessconcern, could you?--and nationality roughly corresponds to race, Ithink."
3903,2,I think it is MEANT to.'There was a moment's pause.
3904,2,"Gerald and Hermione were always strangelybut politely and evenly inimical.'DO you think race corresponds with nationality?' she asked musingly,with expressionless indecision.Birkin knew she was waiting for him to participate."
3905,2,"And dutifully hespoke up.'I think Gerald is right--race is the essential element in nationality,in Europe at least,' he said.Again Hermione paused, as if to allow this statement to cool."
3906,2,"Then shesaid with strange assumption of authority:'Yes, but even so, is the patriotic appeal an appeal to the racialinstinct? Is it not rather an appeal to the proprietory instinct, theCOMMERCIAL instinct? And isn't this what we mean by nationality?''Probably,' said Birkin, who felt that such a discussion was out ofplace and out of time.But Gerald was now on the scent of argument.'A race may have its commercial aspect,' he said."
3907,2,'In fact it must.
3908,2,Itis like a family.
3909,2,You MUST make provision.
3910,2,"And to make provision youhave got to strive against other families, other nations."
3911,2,"I don't seewhy you shouldn't.'Again Hermione made a pause, domineering and cold, before she replied:'Yes, I think it is always wrong to provoke a spirit of rivalry."
3912,2,Itmakes bad blood.
3913,2,And bad blood accumulates.''But you can't do away with the spirit of emulation altogether?' saidGerald.
3914,2,"'It is one of the necessary incentives to production andimprovement.''Yes,' came Hermione's sauntering response."
3915,2,"'I think you can do awaywith it.''I must say,' said Birkin, 'I detest the spirit of emulation.' Hermionewas biting a piece of bread, pulling it from between her teeth with herfingers, in a slow, slightly derisive movement."
3916,2,"She turned to Birkin.'You do hate it, yes,' she said, intimate and gratified.'Detest it,' he repeated.'Yes,' she murmured, assured and satisfied.'But,' Gerald insisted, 'you don't allow one man to take away hisneighbour's living, so why should you allow one nation to take away theliving from another nation?'There was a long slow murmur from Hermione before she broke intospeech, saying with a laconic indifference:'It is not always a question of possessions, is it? It is not all aquestion of goods?'Gerald was nettled by this implication of vulgar materialism.'Yes, more or less,' he retorted."
3917,2,"'If I go and take a man's hat fromoff his head, that hat becomes a symbol of that man's liberty."
3918,2,"When hefights me for his hat, he is fighting me for his liberty.'Hermione was nonplussed.'Yes,' she said, irritated."
3919,2,"'But that way of arguing by imaginaryinstances is not supposed to be genuine, is it? A man does NOT come andtake my hat from off my head, does he?''Only because the law prevents him,' said Gerald.'Not only,' said Birkin."
3920,2,"'Ninety-nine men out of a hundred don't wantmy hat.''That's a matter of opinion,' said Gerald.'Or the hat,' laughed the bridegroom.'And if he does want my hat, such as it is,' said Birkin, 'why, surelyit is open to me to decide, which is a greater loss to me, my hat, ormy liberty as a free and indifferent man."
3921,2,"If I am compelled to offerfight, I lose the latter."
3922,2,"It is a question which is worth more to me,my pleasant liberty of conduct, or my hat.''Yes,' said Hermione, watching Birkin strangely."
3923,2,"'Yes.''But would you let somebody come and snatch your hat off your head?'the bride asked of Hermione.The face of the tall straight woman turned slowly and as if drugged tothis new speaker.'No,' she replied, in a low inhuman tone, that seemed to contain achuckle."
3924,2,"'No, I shouldn't let anybody take my hat off my head.''How would you prevent it?' asked Gerald.'I don't know,' replied Hermione slowly."
3925,2,"'Probably I should kill him.'There was a strange chuckle in her tone, a dangerous and convincinghumour in her bearing.'Of course,' said Gerald, 'I can see Rupert's point."
3926,2,"It is a questionto him whether his hat or his peace of mind is more important.''Peace of body,' said Birkin.'Well, as you like there,' replied Gerald."
3927,2,"'But how are you going todecide this for a nation?''Heaven preserve me,' laughed Birkin.'Yes, but suppose you have to?' Gerald persisted.'Then it is the same."
3928,2,"If the national crown-piece is an old hat, thenthe thieving gent may have it.''But CAN the national or racial hat be an old hat?' insisted Gerald.'Pretty well bound to be, I believe,' said Birkin.'I'm not so sure,' said Gerald.'I don't agree, Rupert,' said Hermione.'All right,' said Birkin.'I'm all for the old national hat,' laughed Gerald.'And a fool you look in it,' cried Diana, his pert sister who was justin her teens.'Oh, we're quite out of our depths with these old hats,' cried LauraCrich."
3929,2,"'Dry up now, Gerald."
3930,2,We're going to drink toasts.
3931,2,Let us drinktoasts.
3932,2,"Toasts--glasses, glasses--now then, toasts! Speech! Speech!'Birkin, thinking about race or national death, watched his glass beingfilled with champagne."
3933,2,"The bubbles broke at the rim, the man withdrew,and feeling a sudden thirst at the sight of the fresh wine, Birkindrank up his glass."
3934,2,A queer little tension in the room roused him.
3935,2,"Hefelt a sharp constraint.'Did I do it by accident, or on purpose?' he asked himself."
3936,2,"And hedecided that, according to the vulgar phrase, he had done it'accidentally on purpose.' He looked round at the hired footman."
3937,2,"Andthe hired footman came, with a silent step of cold servant-likedisapprobation."
3938,2,"Birkin decided that he detested toasts, and footmen,and assemblies, and mankind altogether, in most of its aspects."
3939,2,Then herose to make a speech.
3940,2,"But he was somehow disgusted.At length it was over, the meal."
3941,2,Several men strolled out into thegarden.
3942,2,"There was a lawn, and flower-beds, and at the boundary an ironfence shutting off the little field or park."
3943,2,"The view was pleasant; ahighroad curving round the edge of a low lake, under the trees."
3944,2,"In thespring air, the water gleamed and the opposite woods were purplish withnew life."
3945,2,"Charming Jersey cattle came to the fence, breathing hoarselyfrom their velvet muzzles at the human beings, expecting perhaps acrust.Birkin leaned on the fence."
3946,2,"A cow was breathing wet hotness on hishand.'Pretty cattle, very pretty,' said Marshall, one of thebrothers-in-law."
3947,2,"'They give the best milk you can have.''Yes,' said Birkin.'Eh, my little beauty, eh, my beauty!' said Marshall, in a queer highfalsetto voice, that caused the other man to have convulsions oflaughter in his stomach.'Who won the race, Lupton?' he called to the bridegroom, to hide thefact that he was laughing.The bridegroom took his cigar from his mouth.'The race?' he exclaimed."
3948,2,Then a rather thin smile came over his face.He did not want to say anything about the flight to the church door.'We got there together.
3949,2,"At least she touched first, but I had my handon her shoulder.''What's this?' asked Gerald.Birkin told him about the race of the bride and the bridegroom.'H'm!' said Gerald, in disapproval."
3950,2,"'What made you late then?''Lupton would talk about the immortality of the soul,' said Birkin,'and then he hadn't got a button-hook.''Oh God!' cried Marshall."
3951,2,"'The immortality of the soul on your weddingday! Hadn't you got anything better to occupy your mind?''What's wrong with it?' asked the bridegroom, a clean-shaven naval man,flushing sensitively.'Sounds as if you were going to be executed instead of married."
3952,2,"THEIMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL!' repeated the brother-in-law, with mostkilling emphasis.But he fell quite flat.'And what did you decide?' asked Gerald, at once pricking up his earsat the thought of a metaphysical discussion.'You don't want a soul today, my boy,' said Marshall."
3953,2,"'It'd be in yourroad.''Christ! Marshall, go and talk to somebody else,' cried Gerald, withsudden impatience.'By God, I'm willing,' said Marshall, in a temper."
3954,2,"'Too much bloodysoul and talk altogether--'He withdrew in a dudgeon, Gerald staring after him with angry eyes,that grew gradually calm and amiable as the stoutly-built form of theother man passed into the distance.'There's one thing, Lupton,' said Gerald, turning suddenly to thebridegroom."
3955,2,"'Laura won't have brought such a fool into the family asLottie did.''Comfort yourself with that,' laughed Birkin.'I take no notice of them,' laughed the bridegroom.'What about this race then--who began it?' Gerald asked.'We were late."
3956,2,Laura was at the top of the churchyard steps when ourcab came up.
3957,2,She saw Lupton bolting towards her.
3958,2,And she fled.
3959,2,"But whydo you look so cross? Does it hurt your sense of the family dignity?''It does, rather,' said Gerald."
3960,2,"'If you're doing a thing, do itproperly, and if you're not going to do it properly, leave it alone.''Very nice aphorism,' said Birkin.'Don't you agree?' asked Gerald.'Quite,' said Birkin."
3961,2,"'Only it bores me rather, when you becomeaphoristic.''Damn you, Rupert, you want all the aphorisms your own way,' saidGerald.'No."
3962,2,"I want them out of the way, and you're always shoving them in it.'Gerald smiled grimly at this humorism."
3963,2,"Then he made a little gesture ofdismissal, with his eyebrows.'You don't believe in having any standard of behaviour at all, do you?'he challenged Birkin, censoriously.'Standard--no."
3964,2,I hate standards.
3965,2,But they're necessary for the commonruck.
3966,2,Anybody who is anything can just be himself and do as he likes.''But what do you mean by being himself?' said Gerald.
3967,2,'Is that anaphorism or a cliche?''I mean just doing what you want to do.
3968,2,I think it was perfect goodform in Laura to bolt from Lupton to the church door.
3969,2,It was almost amasterpiece in good form.
3970,2,"It's the hardest thing in the world to actspontaneously on one's impulses--and it's the only really gentlemanlything to do--provided you're fit to do it.''You don't expect me to take you seriously, do you?' asked Gerald.'Yes, Gerald, you're one of the very few people I do expect that of.''Then I'm afraid I can't come up to your expectations here, at anyrate."
3971,2,You think people should just do as they like.''I think they always do.
3972,2,"But I should like them to like the purelyindividual thing in themselves, which makes them act in singleness."
3973,2,"Andthey only like to do the collective thing.''And I,' said Gerald grimly, 'shouldn't like to be in a world of peoplewho acted individually and spontaneously, as you call it."
3974,2,"We shouldhave everybody cutting everybody else's throat in five minutes.''That means YOU would like to be cutting everybody's throat,' saidBirkin.'How does that follow?' asked Gerald crossly.'No man,' said Birkin, 'cuts another man's throat unless he wants tocut it, and unless the other man wants it cutting."
3975,2,This is a completetruth.
3976,2,It takes two people to make a murder: a murderer and a murderee.And a murderee is a man who is murderable.
3977,2,"And a man who is murderableis a man who in a profound if hidden lust desires to be murdered.''Sometimes you talk pure nonsense,' said Gerald to Birkin."
3978,2,"'As a matterof fact, none of us wants our throat cut, and most other people wouldlike to cut it for us--some time or other--''It's a nasty view of things, Gerald,' said Birkin, 'and no wonder youare afraid of yourself and your own unhappiness.''How am I afraid of myself?' said Gerald; 'and I don't think I amunhappy.''You seem to have a lurking desire to have your gizzard slit, andimagine every man has his knife up his sleeve for you,' Birkin said.'How do you make that out?' said Gerald.'From you,' said Birkin.There was a pause of strange enmity between the two men, that was verynear to love."
3979,2,"It was always the same between them; always their talkbrought them into a deadly nearness of contact, a strange, perilousintimacy which was either hate or love, or both."
3980,2,"They parted withapparent unconcern, as if their going apart were a trivial occurrence.And they really kept it to the level of trivial occurrence."
3981,2,Yet theheart of each burned from the other.
3982,2,"They burned with each other,inwardly."
3983,2,This they would never admit.
3984,2,"They intended to keep theirrelationship a casual free-and-easy friendship, they were not going tobe so unmanly and unnatural as to allow any heart-burning between them.They had not the faintest belief in deep relationship between men andmen, and their disbelief prevented any development of their powerfulbut suppressed friendliness.CHAPTER III.CLASS-ROOMA school-day was drawing to a close."
3985,2,"In the class-room the last lessonwas in progress, peaceful and still."
3986,2,It was elementary botany.
3987,2,"Thedesks were littered with catkins, hazel and willow, which the childrenhad been sketching."
3988,2,"But the sky had come overdark, as the end of theafternoon approached: there was scarcely light to draw any more."
3989,2,"Ursulastood in front of the class, leading the children by questions tounderstand the structure and the meaning of the catkins.A heavy, copper-coloured beam of light came in at the west window,gilding the outlines of the children's heads with red gold, and fallingon the wall opposite in a rich, ruddy illumination."
3990,2,"Ursula, however,was scarcely conscious of it."
3991,2,"She was busy, the end of the day washere, the work went on as a peaceful tide that is at flood, hushed toretire.This day had gone by like so many more, in an activity that was like atrance."
3992,2,"At the end there was a little haste, to finish what was inhand."
3993,2,"She was pressing the children with questions, so that they shouldknow all they were to know, by the time the gong went."
3994,2,"She stood inshadow in front of the class, with catkins in her hand, and she leanedtowards the children, absorbed in the passion of instruction.She heard, but did not notice the click of the door."
3995,2,Suddenly shestarted.
3996,2,"She saw, in the shaft of ruddy, copper-coloured light nearher, the face of a man."
3997,2,"It was gleaming like fire, watching her,waiting for her to be aware."
3998,2,It startled her terribly.
3999,2,She thought shewas going to faint.
4000,2,"All her suppressed, subconscious fear sprang intobeing, with anguish.'Did I startle you?' said Birkin, shaking hands with her."
4001,2,"'I thoughtyou had heard me come in.''No,' she faltered, scarcely able to speak."
4002,2,"He laughed, saying he wassorry."
4003,2,"She wondered why it amused him.'It is so dark,' he said."
4004,2,"'Shall we have the light?'And moving aside, he switched on the strong electric lights."
4005,2,"Theclass-room was distinct and hard, a strange place after the soft dimmagic that filled it before he came."
4006,2,Birkin turned curiously to look atUrsula.
4007,2,"Her eyes were round and wondering, bewildered, her mouthquivered slightly."
4008,2,She looked like one who is suddenly wakened.
4009,2,"Therewas a living, tender beauty, like a tender light of dawn shining fromher face."
4010,2,"He looked at her with a new pleasure, feeling gay in hisheart, irresponsible.'You are doing catkins?' he asked, picking up a piece of hazel from ascholar's desk in front of him."
4011,2,"'Are they as far out as this? I hadn'tnoticed them this year.'He looked absorbedly at the tassel of hazel in his hand.'The red ones too!' he said, looking at the flickers of crimson thatcame from the female bud.Then he went in among the desks, to see the scholars' books."
4012,2,Ursulawatched his intent progress.
4013,2,There was a stillness in his motion thathushed the activities of her heart.
4014,2,"She seemed to be standing aside inarrested silence, watching him move in another, concentrated world."
4015,2,"Hispresence was so quiet, almost like a vacancy in the corporate air.Suddenly he lifted his face to her, and her heart quickened at theflicker of his voice.'Give them some crayons, won't you?' he said, 'so that they can makethe gynaecious flowers red, and the androgynous yellow."
4016,2,"I'd chalk themin plain, chalk in nothing else, merely the red and the yellow."
4017,2,Outlinescarcely matters in this case.
4018,2,"There is just the one fact toemphasise.''I haven't any crayons,' said Ursula.'There will be some somewhere--red and yellow, that's all you want.'Ursula sent out a boy on a quest.'It will make the books untidy,' she said to Birkin, flushing deeply.'Not very,' he said."
4019,2,'You must mark in these things obviously.
4020,2,"It's thefact you want to emphasise, not the subjective impression to record.What's the fact?--red little spiky stigmas of the female flower,dangling yellow male catkin, yellow pollen flying from one to theother."
4021,2,"Make a pictorial record of the fact, as a child does whendrawing a face--two eyes, one nose, mouth with teeth--so--' And he drewa figure on the blackboard.At that moment another vision was seen through the glass panels of thedoor."
4022,2,It was Hermione Roddice.
4023,2,"Birkin went and opened to her.'I saw your car,' she said to him."
4024,2,"'Do you mind my coming to find you?I wanted to see you when you were on duty.'She looked at him for a long time, intimate and playful, then she gavea short little laugh."
4025,2,"And then only she turned to Ursula, who, with allthe class, had been watching the little scene between the lovers.'How do you do, Miss Brangwen,' sang Hermione, in her low, odd, singingfashion, that sounded almost as if she were poking fun."
4026,2,"'Do you mind mycoming in?'Her grey, almost sardonic eyes rested all the while on Ursula, as ifsumming her up.'Oh no,' said Ursula.'Are you SURE?' repeated Hermione, with complete sang froid, and anodd, half-bullying effrontery.'Oh no, I like it awfully,' laughed Ursula, a little bit excited andbewildered, because Hermione seemed to be compelling her, coming veryclose to her, as if intimate with her; and yet, how could she beintimate?This was the answer Hermione wanted."
4027,2,"She turned satisfied to Birkin.'What are you doing?' she sang, in her casual, inquisitive fashion.'Catkins,' he replied.'Really!' she said."
4028,2,"'And what do you learn about them?' She spoke allthe while in a mocking, half teasing fashion, as if making game of thewhole business."
4029,2,"She picked up a twig of the catkin, piqued by Birkin'sattention to it.She was a strange figure in the class-room, wearing a large, old cloakof greenish cloth, on which was a raised pattern of dull gold."
4030,2,"The highcollar, and the inside of the cloak, was lined with dark fur."
4031,2,"Beneathshe had a dress of fine lavender-coloured cloth, trimmed with fur, andher hat was close-fitting, made of fur and of the dull, green-and-goldfigured stuff."
4032,2,"She was tall and strange, she looked as if she had comeout of some new, bizarre picture.'Do you know the little red ovary flowers, that produce the nuts? Haveyou ever noticed them?' he asked her."
4033,2,"And he came close and pointedthem out to her, on the sprig she held.'No,' she replied."
4034,2,"'What are they?''Those are the little seed-producing flowers, and the long catkins,they only produce pollen, to fertilise them.''Do they, do they!' repeated Hermione, looking closely.'From those little red bits, the nuts come; if they receive pollen fromthe long danglers.''Little red flames, little red flames,' murmured Hermione to herself.And she remained for some moments looking only at the small buds out ofwhich the red flickers of the stigma issued.'Aren't they beautiful? I think they're so beautiful,' she said, movingclose to Birkin, and pointing to the red filaments with her long, whitefinger.'Had you never noticed them before?' he asked.'No, never before,' she replied.'And now you will always see them,' he said.'Now I shall always see them,' she repeated."
4035,2,'Thank you so much forshowing me.
4036,2,"I think they're so beautiful--little red flames--'Her absorption was strange, almost rhapsodic."
4037,2,Both Birkin and Ursulawere suspended.
4038,2,"The little red pistillate flowers had some strange,almost mystic-passionate attraction for her.The lesson was finished, the books were put away, at last the class wasdismissed."
4039,2,"And still Hermione sat at the table, with her chin in herhand, her elbow on the table, her long white face pushed up, notattending to anything."
4040,2,"Birkin had gone to the window, and was lookingfrom the brilliantly-lighted room on to the grey, colourless outside,where rain was noiselessly falling."
4041,2,"Ursula put away her things in thecupboard.At length Hermione rose and came near to her.'Your sister has come home?' she said.'Yes,' said Ursula.'And does she like being back in Beldover?''No,' said Ursula.'No, I wonder she can bear it."
4042,2,"It takes all my strength, to bear theugliness of this district, when I stay here."
4043,2,"Won't you come and see me?Won't you come with your sister to stay at Breadalby for a fewdays?--do--''Thank you very much,' said Ursula.'Then I will write to you,' said Hermione."
4044,2,'You think your sister willcome? I should be so glad.
4045,2,I think she is wonderful.
4046,2,I think some ofher work is really wonderful.
4047,2,"I have two water-wagtails, carved inwood, and painted--perhaps you have seen it?''No,' said Ursula.'I think it is perfectly wonderful--like a flash of instinct.''Her little carvings ARE strange,' said Ursula.'Perfectly beautiful--full of primitive passion--''Isn't it queer that she always likes little things?--she must alwayswork small things, that one can put between one's hands, birds and tinyanimals."
4048,2,"She likes to look through the wrong end of the opera glasses,and see the world that way--why is it, do you think?'Hermione looked down at Ursula with that long, detached scrutinisinggaze that excited the younger woman.'Yes,' said Hermione at length."
4049,2,'It is curious.
4050,2,"The little things seemto be more subtle to her--''But they aren't, are they? A mouse isn't any more subtle than a lion,is it?'Again Hermione looked down at Ursula with that long scrutiny, as if shewere following some train of thought of her own, and barely attendingto the other's speech.'I don't know,' she replied.'Rupert, Rupert,' she sang mildly, calling him to her."
4051,2,"He approached insilence.'Are little things more subtle than big things?' she asked, with theodd grunt of laughter in her voice, as if she were making game of himin the question.'Dunno,' he said.'I hate subtleties,' said Ursula.Hermione looked at her slowly.'Do you?' she said.'I always think they are a sign of weakness,' said Ursula, up in arms,as if her prestige were threatened.Hermione took no notice."
4052,2,"Suddenly her face puckered, her brow was knitwith thought, she seemed twisted in troublesome effort for utterance.'Do you really think, Rupert,' she asked, as if Ursula were notpresent, 'do you really think it is worth while? Do you really thinkthe children are better for being roused to consciousness?'A dark flash went over his face, a silent fury."
4053,2,"He was hollow-cheekedand pale, almost unearthly."
4054,2,"And the woman, with her serious,conscience-harrowing question tortured him on the quick.'They are not roused to consciousness,' he said."
4055,2,"'Consciousness comesto them, willy-nilly.''But do you think they are better for having it quickened, stimulated?Isn't it better that they should remain unconscious of the hazel, isn'tit better that they should see as a whole, without all this pulling topieces, all this knowledge?''Would you rather, for yourself, know or not know, that the little redflowers are there, putting out for the pollen?' he asked harshly."
4056,2,"Hisvoice was brutal, scornful, cruel.Hermione remained with her face lifted up, abstracted."
4057,2,"He hung silentin irritation.'I don't know,' she replied, balancing mildly."
4058,2,"'I don't know.''But knowing is everything to you, it is all your life,' he broke out.She slowly looked at him.'Is it?' she said.'To know, that is your all, that is your life--you have only this, thisknowledge,' he cried."
4059,2,"'There is only one tree, there is only one fruit,in your mouth.'Again she was some time silent.'Is there?' she said at last, with the same untouched calm."
4060,2,"And then ina tone of whimsical inquisitiveness: 'What fruit, Rupert?''The eternal apple,' he replied in exasperation, hating his ownmetaphors.'Yes,' she said."
4061,2,There was a look of exhaustion about her.
4062,2,For somemoments there was silence.
4063,2,"Then, pulling herself together with aconvulsed movement, Hermione resumed, in a sing-song, casual voice:'But leaving me apart, Rupert; do you think the children are better,richer, happier, for all this knowledge; do you really think they are?Or is it better to leave them untouched, spontaneous."
4064,2,"Hadn't theybetter be animals, simple animals, crude, violent, ANYTHING, ratherthan this self-consciousness, this incapacity to be spontaneous.'They thought she had finished."
4065,2,"But with a queer rumbling in her throatshe resumed, 'Hadn't they better be anything than grow up crippled,crippled in their souls, crippled in their feelings--so thrown back--soturned back on themselves--incapable--' Hermione clenched her fist likeone in a trance--'of any spontaneous action, always deliberate, alwaysburdened with choice, never carried away.'Again they thought she had finished."
4066,2,"But just as he was going to reply,she resumed her queer rhapsody--'never carried away, out of themselves,always conscious, always self-conscious, always aware of themselves.Isn't ANYTHING better than this? Better be animals, mere animals withno mind at all, than this, this NOTHINGNESS--''But do you think it is knowledge that makes us unliving andselfconscious?' he asked irritably.She opened her eyes and looked at him slowly.'Yes,' she said."
4067,2,"She paused, watching him all the while, her eyesvague."
4068,2,"Then she wiped her fingers across her brow, with a vagueweariness."
4069,2,It irritated him bitterly.
4070,2,"'It is the mind,' she said, 'andthat is death.' She raised her eyes slowly to him: 'Isn't the mind--'she said, with the convulsed movement of her body, 'isn't it our death?Doesn't it destroy all our spontaneity, all our instincts? Are not theyoung people growing up today, really dead before they have a chance tolive?''Not because they have too much mind, but too little,' he saidbrutally.'Are you SURE?' she cried."
4071,2,'It seems to me the reverse.
4072,2,"They areoverconscious, burdened to death with consciousness.''Imprisoned within a limited, false set of concepts,' he cried.But she took no notice of this, only went on with her own rhapsodicinterrogation.'When we have knowledge, don't we lose everything but knowledge?' sheasked pathetically."
4073,2,"'If I know about the flower, don't I lose theflower and have only the knowledge? Aren't we exchanging the substancefor the shadow, aren't we forfeiting life for this dead quality ofknowledge? And what does it mean to me, after all? What does all thisknowing mean to me? It means nothing.''You are merely making words,' he said; 'knowledge means everything toyou."
4074,2,"Even your animalism, you want it in your head."
4075,2,"You don't want toBE an animal, you want to observe your own animal functions, to get amental thrill out of them."
4076,2,It is all purely secondary--and moredecadent than the most hide-bound intellectualism.
4077,2,"What is it but theworst and last form of intellectualism, this love of yours for passionand the animal instincts? Passion and the instincts--you want them hardenough, but through your head, in your consciousness."
4078,2,"It all takesplace in your head, under that skull of yours."
4079,2,Only you won't beconscious of what ACTUALLY is: you want the lie that will match therest of your furniture.'Hermione set hard and poisonous against this attack.
4080,2,Ursula stoodcovered with wonder and shame.
4081,2,"It frightened her, to see how they hatedeach other.'It's all that Lady of Shalott business,' he sai."
4082,3,In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains.
4083,3,"In the bed of the river there were pebbles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the channels."
4084,3,Troops went by the house and down the road and the dust they raised powdered the leaves of the trees.
4085,3,"The trunks of the trees too were dusty and the leaves fell early that year and we saw the troops marching along the road and the dust rising and leaves, stirred by the breeze, falling and the soldiers marching and afterward the road bare and white except for the leaves.The plain was rich with crops; there were many orchards of fruit trees and beyond the plain the mountains were brown and bare."
4086,3,There was fighting in the mountains and at night we could see the flashes from the artillery.
4087,3,"In the dark it was like summer lightning, but the nights were cool and there was not the feeling of a storm coming.Sometimes in the dark we heard the troops marching under the window and guns going past pulled by motor-tractors."
4088,3,"There was much traffic at night and many mules on the roads with boxes of ammunition on each side of their pack-saddles andgray motor trucks that carried men, and other trucks with loads covered with canvas that moved slower in the traffic."
4089,3,"There were big guns too that passed in the day drawn by tractors, the long barrels of the guns covered with green branches and green leafy branches and vines laid over the tractors."
4090,3,To the north we could look across a valley and see a forest of chestnut trees and behind it another mountain on this side of the river.
4091,3,"There was fighting for that mountain too, but it was not successful, and in the fall when the rains came the leaves all fell from the chestnut trees and the branches were bare and the trunks black with rain."
4092,3,The vineyards were thin and bare-branched too and all the country wet and brown and dead with the autumn.
4093,3,"There were mists over the river and clouds on the mountain and the trucks splashed mud on the road and the troops were muddy and wet in their capes; their rifles were wet and under their capes the two leather cartridge-boxes on the front of the belts, gray leather boxes heavy with the packs of clips of thin, long 6.5mm."
4094,3,"cartridges, bulged forward under the capes so that the men, passing on the road, marched as though they were six months gone with child.There were small gray motor cars that passed going very fast; usually there was an officer on the seat with the driver and more officers in the back seat."
4095,3,"They splashed more mud than the camions even and if one of the officers in the back was very small and sitting between two generals, he himself so small that you could not see his face but only the top of his cap and his narrow back, and if the car went especially fast it was probably the King."
4096,3,"He lived in Udine and came out in this way nearlyevery day to see how things were going, and things went very badly.At the start of the winter came the permanent rain and with the rain came the cholera."
4097,3,But it was checked and in the end only seven thousand died of it in the army.2The next year there were many victories.
4098,3,The mountain that was beyond the valley and the hillside where the chestnut forest grew was captured and there were victories beyond the plain on the plateau to the south and we crossed the river in August and lived in a house in Gorizia that had a fountain and many thick shady trees in a walled garden and a wistaria vine purple on the side of the house.
4099,3,Now the fighting was in the next mountains beyond and was not a mile away.
4100,3,The town was very nice and our house was very fine.
4101,3,"The river ran behind us and the town had been captured very handsomely but the mountains beyond it could not be taken and I was very glad the Austrians seemed to want to come back to the town some time, if the war should end, because they did not bombard it to destroy it but only a little in a military way."
4102,3,"People lived on in it and there were hospitals and cafs and artillery up side streets and two bawdyhouses, one for troops and one for officers, and with the end of the summer, the cool nights, the fighting in the mountains beyond the town, the shell-marked iron of the railway bridge, the smashed tunnel by the river where the fighting had been, the trees around the square and the long avenue of trees that led to the square; these with there being girls in the town, the King passing in his motor car, sometimes now seeing his face and little long necked body and gray beard like a goat's chin tuft; all these with the sudden interiors of houses that had lost a wall through shelling, with plaster and rubble in their gardens and sometimes in the street, and the whole thing going well on the Carso made the fall very different from the last fall when we had been in the country."
4103,3,The war was changed too.The forest of oak trees on the mountain beyond the town was gone.
4104,3,"The forest had been green in the summer when we had come into the town but now there were the stumps and the broken trunks and the ground torn up, and one day at the end of the fall when I was out where the oak forest had been I saw a cloud coming over the mountain."
4105,3,It came very fast and the sun went a dull yellow and then everything was gray and the sky was covered and the cloud came on down the mountain and suddenly we were in it and it was snow.
4106,3,"The snow slanted across the wind, the bare ground was covered, the stumps of trees projected, there was snow on the guns and there were paths in the snow going back to the latrines behind trenches.Later, below in the town, I watched the snow falling, looking out of the window of the bawdy house, the house for officers, where I sat with a friend and two glasses drinking a bottle ofAsti, and, looking out at the snow falling slowly and heavily, we knew it was all over for that year."
4107,3,Up the river the mountains had not been taken; none of the mountains beyond the river had been taken.
4108,3,That was all left for next year.
4109,3,"My friend saw the priest from our mess going by in the street, walking carefully in the slush, and pounded on the window to attract his attention.The priest looked up."
4110,3,He saw us and smiled.
4111,3,My friend motioned for him to come in.
4112,3,The priest shook his head and went on.
4113,3,"That night in the mess after the spaghetti course, which every one ate very quickly and seriously, lifting the spaghetti on the fork until the loose strands hung clear then lowering it into the mouth, or else using a continuous lift and sucking into the mouth, helping ourselves to wine from the grass-covered gallon flask; it swung in a metal cradle and you pulled the neck of the flask down with the forefinger and the wine, clear red, tannic and lovely, poured out into the glass held with the same hand; after this course, the captain commenced picking on the priest.The priest was young and blushed easily and wore a uniform like the rest of us but with a cross in dark red velvet above the left breast pocket of his gray tunic."
4114,3,"The captain spoke pidgin Italian for my doubtful benefit, in order that I might understand perfectly, that nothing should be lost.""Priest to-day with girls,"" the captain said looking at the priest and at me."
4115,3,The priest smiled and blushed and shook his head.
4116,3,"This captain baited him often.""Not true?"" asked the captain."
4117,3,"""To-day I see priest with girls.""""No,"" said the priest."
4118,3,"The other officers were amused at the baiting.""Priest not with girls,"" went on the captain."
4119,3,"""Priest never with girls,"" he explained to me."
4120,3,"He took my glass and filled it, looking at my eyes all the time, but not losing sight of the priest.""Priest every night five against one."" Every one at the table laughed."
4121,3,"""You understand? Priest every night five against one."" He made a gesture and laughed loudly."
4122,3,"The priest accepted it as a joke.""The Pope wants the Austrians to win the war,"" the major said."
4123,3,"""He loves Franz Joseph."
4124,3,That's where the money comes from.
4125,3,"I am an atheist.""""Did you ever read the 'Black Pig'?"" asked the lieutenant."
4126,3,"""I will get you a copy."
4127,3,"It was that which shook my faith.""""It is a filthy and vile book,"" said the priest."
4128,3,"""You do not really like it.""""It is very valuable,"" said the lieutenant."
4129,3,"""It tells you about those priests."
4130,3,"You will like it,"" he said to me."
4131,3,I smiled at the priest and he smiled back across the candle-light.
4132,3,"""Don't you read it,"" he said.""I will get it for you,"" said the lieutenant.""All thinking men are atheists,"" the major said."
4133,3,"""I do not believe in the Free Masons however.""""I believe in the Free Masons,"" the lieutenant said."
4134,3,"""It is a noble organization."" Some one came in and as the door opened I could see the snow falling.""There will be no more offensive now that the snow has come,"" I said.""Certainly not,"" said the major."
4135,3,"""You should go on leave."
4136,3,"You should go to Rome, Naples, Sicily--""""He should visit Amalfi,"" said the lieutenant."
4137,3,"""I will write you cards to my family in Amalfi."
4138,3,"They will love you like a son.""""He should go to Palermo."" ""He ought to go to Capri.""""I would like you to see Abruzzi and visit my family at Capracotta,"" said the priest.""Listen to him talk about the Abruzzi."
4139,3,There's more snow there than here.
4140,3,He doesn't want to see peasants.
4141,3,"Let him go to centres of culture and civilization.""""He should have fine girls."
4142,3,I will give you the addresses of places in Naples.
4143,3,Beautiful young girls--accompanied by their mothers.
4144,3,"Ha! Ha! Ha!"" The captain spread his hand open, the thumb up and fingers outspread as when you make shadow pictures."
4145,3,There was a shadow from his hand on the wall.
4146,3,He spoke again in pidgin Italian.
4147,3,"""You go away like this,"" he pointed to the thumb, ""and come back like this,"" he touched the little finger."
4148,3,"Every one laughed.""Look,"" said the captain."
4149,3,He spread the hand again.
4150,3,Again the candle-light made its shadows on the wall.
4151,3,"He started with the upright thumb and named in their order the thumb and four fingers, ""soto-tenente (the thumb), tenente (first finger), capitano (next finger), maggiore (next to the little finger), and tenentecolonello (the little finger)."
4152,3,"You go away soto-tenente!You come back soto-colonello!"" They all laughed."
4153,3,The captain was having a great success with finger games.
4154,3,"He looked atthe priest and shouted, ""Every night priest five against one!"" They all laughed again.""You must go on leave at once,"" the major said.""I would like to go with you and show you things,"" the lieutenant said.""When you come back bring a phonograph."" ""Bring good opera disks.""""Bring Caruso.""""Don't bring Caruso."
4155,3,"He bellows.""""Don't you wish you could bellow like him?"" ""He bellows."
4156,3,"I say he bellows!""""I would like you to go to Abruzzi,"" the priest said."
4157,3,The others were shouting.
4158,3,"""There is good hunting."
4159,3,You would like the people and though it is cold it is clear and dry.
4160,3,You could stay with my family.
4161,3,"My father is a famous hunter.""""Come on,"" said the captain."
4162,3,"""We go whorehouse before it shuts.""""Good-night,"" I said to the priest."
4163,3,"""Good-night,"" he said.3When I came back to the front we still lived in that town."
4164,3,There were many more guns in the country around and thespring had come.
4165,3,"The fields were green and there were small green shoots on the vines, the trees along the road had small leaves and a breeze came from the sea."
4166,3,"I saw the town with the hill and the old castle above it in a cup in the hills with the mountains beyond, brown mountains with a little green on their slopes."
4167,3,"In the town there were more guns, there were some new hospitals, you met British men and sometimes women, on the street, and a few more houses had been hit by shell fire."
4168,3,"Jt was warm and like the spring and I walked down the alleyway of trees, warmed from the sun on the wall, and found we still lived in the same house and that it all looked the same as when I had left it."
4169,3,"The door was open, there was a soldier sitting on a bench outside in the sun, an ambulance was waiting by the side door and inside the door, as I went in, there was the smell of marble floors and hospital."
4170,3,It was all as I had left it except that now it was spring.
4171,3,"I looked in the door of the big room and saw the major sitting at his desk, the window open and the sunlight coming into the room."
4172,3,He did not see me and I did not know whether to go in and report or go upstairs first and clean up.
4173,3,I decided to go on upstairs.The room I shared with the lieutenant Rinaldi looked out on the courtyard.
4174,3,"The window was open, my bed was made up with blankets and my things hung on the wall, the gas mask in an oblong tin can, the steel helmet on the same peg."
4175,3,"At the foot of the bed was my flat trunk, and my winter boots, the leather shiny with oil, were on the trunk."
4176,3,"My Austrian sniper's rifle with its blued octagon barrel and the lovely dark walnut, cheek-fitted,schutzen stock, hung over the two beds."
4177,3,"The telescope that fitted it was, I remembered, locked in the trunk."
4178,3,"The lieutenant, Rinaldi, lay asleep on the other bed."
4179,3,"He woke when he heard me in the room and sat up.""Ciaou!"" he said."
4180,3,"""What kind of time did you have?"" ""Magnificent.""We shook hands and he put his arm around my neck and kissed me.""Oughf,"" I said.""You're dirty,"" he said."
4181,3,"""You ought to wash."
4182,3,"Where did you go and what did you do? Tell me everything at once.""""I went everywhere."
4183,3,"Milan, Florence, Rome, Naples, Villa San Giovanni, Messina, Taormina--""""You talk like a time-table."
4184,3,"Did you have any beautiful adventures?""""Yes.""""Where?""""Milano, Firenze, Roma, Napoli--""""That's enough."
4185,3,"Tell me really what was the best."" ""In Milano.""""That was because it was first."
4186,3,Where did you meet her? In the Cova? Where did you go? How did you feel? Tell me everything at once.
4187,3,"Did you stay all night?""""Yes.""""That's nothing."
4188,3,Here now we have beautiful girls.
4189,3,"New girls never been to the front before.""""Wonderful.""""You don't believe me? We will go now this afternoon andsee."
4190,3,And in the town we have beautiful English girls.
4191,3,I am now in love with Miss Barkley.
4192,3,I will take you to call.
4193,3,"I will probably marry Miss Barkley.""""I have to get washed and report."
4194,3,"Doesn't anybody work now?""""Since you are gone we have nothing but frostbites, chilblains, jaundice, gonorrhea, self-inflicted wounds, pneumonia and hard and soft chancres."
4195,3,Every week some one gets wounded by rock fragments.
4196,3,There are a few real wounded.
4197,3,Next week the war starts again.
4198,3,Perhaps it start again.
4199,3,They say so.
4200,3,"Do you think I would do right to marry Miss Barkley--after the war of course?""""Absolutely,"" I said and poured the basin full of water."
4201,3,"""To-night you will tell me everything,"" said Rinaldi."
4202,3,"""Now Imust go back to sleep to be fresh and beautiful for Miss Barkley.""I took off my tunic and shirt and washed in the cold water in the basin."
4203,3,While I rubbed myself with a towel I looked around the room and out the window and at Rinaldi lying with his eyes closed on the bed.
4204,3,"He was good-looking, was my age, and he came from Amalfi."
4205,3,He loved being a surgeon and we were great friends.
4206,3,"While I was looking at him he opened his eyes.""Have you any money?"" ""Yes.""""Loan me fifty lire.""I dried my hands and took out my pocket-book from the inside of my tunic hanging on the wall."
4207,3,"Rinaldi took the note,folded it without rising from the bed and slid it in his breeches pocket."
4208,3,"He smiled, ""I must make on Miss Barkley the impression of a man of sufficient wealth."
4209,3,"You are my great and good friend and financial protector.""""Go to hell,"" I said.That night at the mess I sat next to the priest and he was disappointed and suddenly hurt that I had not gone to the Abruzzi."
4210,3,He had written to his father that I was coming and they had made preparations.
4211,3,I myself felt as badly as he did and could not understand why I had not gone.
4212,3,It was what I had wanted to do and I tried to explain how one thing had led to another and finally he saw it and understood that I had really wanted to go and it was almost all right.
4213,3,"I had drunk much wine and afterward coffee and Strega and I explained, winefully, how we did not do the things we wanted to do; we never did such things.We two were talking while the others argued."
4214,3,I had wanted to go to Abruzzi.
4215,3,"I had gone to no place where the roads were frozen and hard as iron, where it was clear cold and dry and the snow was dry and powdery and hare-tracks in the snow and the peasants took off their hats and called you Lord and there was good hunting."
4216,3,"I had gone to no such place but to the smoke of cafs and nights when the room whirled and you needed to look at the wall to make it stop, nights in bed, drunk, when you knew that that was all there was, and the strange excitement of waking and not knowing who it was with you, and the world all unreal in the dark and so exciting that you must resume again unknowing and not caring in the night, sure that this was all andall and all and not caring."
4217,3,Suddenly to care very much and to sleep to wake with it sometimes morning and all that had been there gone and everything sharp and hard and clear and sometimes a dispute about the cost.
4218,3,Sometimes still pleasant and fond and warm and breakfast and lunch.
4219,3,Sometimes all niceness gone and glad to get out on the street but always another day starting and then another night.
4220,3,I tried to tell about the night and the difference between the night and the day and how the night was better unless the day was very clean and cold and I could not tell it; as I cannot tell it now.
4221,3,But if you have had it you know.
4222,3,"He had not had it but he understood that I had really wanted to go to the Abruzzi but had not gone and we were still friends, with many tastes alike, but with the difference between us."
4223,3,"He had always known what I did not know and what, when I learned it, I was always able to forget."
4224,3,"But I did not know that then, although I learned it later."
4225,3,"In the meantime we were all at the mess, the meal was finished, and the argument went on."
4226,3,"We two stopped talking and the captain shouted, ""Priest not happy."
4227,3,"Priest not happy without girls.""""I am happy,"" said the priest.""Priest not happy."
4228,3,"Priest wants Austrians to win the war,"" the captain said."
4229,3,The others listened.
4230,3,"The priest shook his head.""No,"" he said.""Priest wants us never to attack."
4231,3,"Don't you want us never to attack?""""No."
4232,3,"If there is a war I suppose we must attack."" ""Must attack."
4233,3,"Shall attack!""The priest nodded.""Leave him alone,"" the major said."
4234,3,"""He's all right.""""He can't do anything about it anyway,"" the captain said."
4235,3,We all got up and left the table.4The battery in the next garden woke me in the morning and I saw the sun coming through the window and got out of the bed.
4236,3,I went to the window and looked out.
4237,3,The gravel paths were moist and the grass was wet with dew.
4238,3,The battery fired twice and the air came each time like a blow and shook the window and made the front of my pajamas flap.
4239,3,I could not see the guns but they were evidently firing directly over us.
4240,3,It was a nuisance to have them there but it was a comfort that they were no bigger.
4241,3,As I looked out at the garden I heard a motor truck starting on the road.
4242,3,"I dressed, went downstairs, had some coffee in the kitchen and went out to the garage.Ten cars were lined up side by side under the long shed."
4243,3,"They were top-heavy, blunt-nosed ambulances, painted gray and built like moving-vans."
4244,3,The mechanics were working on one out in the yard.
4245,3,"Three others were up in the mountains at dressing stations.""Do they ever shell that battery?"" Tasked one of themechanics.""No, Signor Tenente."
4246,3,"It is protected by the little hill."" ""How's everything?""""Not so bad."
4247,3,"This machine is no good but the others march."" He stopped working and smiled."
4248,3,"""Were you on permission?""""Yes.""He wiped his hands on his jumper and grinned."
4249,3,"""You have a good time?"" The others all grinned too.""Fine,"" I said."
4250,3,"""What's the matter with this machine?"" ""It's no good."
4251,3,"One thing after another.""""What's the matter now?"" ""New rings.""I left them working, the car looking disgraced and empty with the engine open and parts spread on the work bench, and went in under the shed and looked at each of the cars."
4252,3,"They were moderately clean, a few freshly washed, the others dusty."
4253,3,"I looked at the tires carefully, looking for cuts or stone bruises.Everything seemed in good condition."
4254,3,It evidently made no difference whether I was there to look after things or not.
4255,3,"I had imagined that the condition of the cars, whether or not things were obtainable, the smooth functioning of the business of removing wounded and sick from the dressing stations, hauling them back from the mountains to the clearing station and then distributing them to the hospitals named on their papers, depended to a considerable extent on myself."
4256,3,"Evidently it did not matter whether I was there or not.""Has there been any trouble getting parts?"" I asked thesergeant mechanic.""No, Signor Tenente.""""Where is the gasoline park now?"" ""At the same place.""""Good,"" I said and went back to the house and drank another bowl of coffee at the mess table."
4257,3,The coffee was a pale gray and sweet with condensed milk.
4258,3,Outside the window it was a lovely spring morning.
4259,3,There was that beginning of a feeling of dryness in the nose that meant the day would be hot later on.That day I visited the posts in the mountains and was back in town late in the afternoon.The whole thing seemed to run better while I was away.
4260,3,The offensive was going to start again I heard.
4261,3,The division for which we worked were to attack at a place up the river and the major told me that I would see about the posts for during the attack.
4262,3,The attack would cross the river up above the narrow gorge and spread up the hillside.
4263,3,The posts for the cars would have to be as near the river as they could get and keep covered.
4264,3,"They would, of course, be selected by the infantry but we were supposed to work it out."
4265,3,It was one of those things that gave you a false feeling of soldiering.I was very dusty and dirty and went up to my room to wash.
4266,3,Rinaldi was sitting on the bed with a copy of Hugo's English grammar.
4267,3,"He was dressed, wore his black boots, and his hair shone.""Splendid,"" he said when he saw me."
4268,3,"""You will come with me to see Miss Barkley.""""No.""Yes."
4269,3,"You will please come and make me a good impression on her.""""All right."
4270,3,"Wait till I get cleaned up."" ""Wash up and come as you are.""I washed, brushed my hair and we started.""Wait a minute,"" Rinaldi said."
4271,3,"""Perhaps we should have a drink."" He opened his trunk and took out a bottle.""Not Strega,"" I said."
4272,3,"""No."
4273,3,"Grappa.""""All right.""He poured two glasses and we touched them, first fingers extended."
4274,3,"The grappa was very strong.""Another?""""All right,"" I said."
4275,3,"We drank the second grappa, Rinaldi put away the bottle and we went down the stairs."
4276,3,It was hot walking through the town but the sun was starting to go down and it was very pleasant.
4277,3,The British hospital was a big villa built by Germans before the war.
4278,3,Miss Barkley was in the garden.Another nurse was with her.
4279,3,We saw their white uniforms through the trees and walked toward them.
4280,3,Rinaldi saluted.
4281,3,"I saluted too but more moderately.""How do you do?"" Miss Barkley said."
4282,3,"""You're not an Italian, are you?""""Oh, no.""Rinaldi was talking with the other nurse."
4283,3,They were laughing.
4284,3,"""What an odd thing--to be in the Italian army.""""It's not really the army."
4285,3,"It's only the ambulance.""""It's very odd though."
4286,3,"Why did you do it?""""I don't know,"" I said."
4287,3,"""There isn't always an explanation for everything.""""Oh, isn't there? I was brought up to think there was."" ""That's awfully nice.""""Do we have to go on and talk this way?"" ""No,"" I said.""That's a relief."
4288,3,"Isn't it?""""What is the stick?"" I asked."
4289,3,Miss Barkley was quite tall.
4290,3,"She wore what seemed to me to be a nurse's uniform, was blonde and had a tawny skin and gray eyes."
4291,3,I thought she was very beautiful.
4292,3,"She was carrying a thin rattan stick like a toy riding-crop, bound in leather.""It belonged to a boy who was killed last year."" ""I'm awfully sorry.""""He was a very nice boy."
4293,3,"He was going to marry me and he was killed in the Somme.""""It was a ghastly show."" ""Were you there?"" ""No.""""I've heard about it,"" she said."
4294,3,"""There's not really any war of that sort down here."
4295,3,They sent me the little stick.
4296,3,His mother sent it to me.
4297,3,"They returned it with his things.""""Had you been engaged long?"" ""Eight years."
4298,3,"We grew up together."" ""And why didn't you marry?""""I don't know,"" she said."
4299,3,"""I was a fool not to."
4300,3,I could have given him that anyway.
4301,3,"But I thought it would be bad for him.""""I see.""""Have you ever loved any one?"" ""No,"" I said.We sat down on a bench and I looked at her."
4302,3,"""You have beautiful hair,"" I said.""Do you like it?"" ""Very much.""""I was going to cut it all off when he died."" ""No.""""I wanted to do something for him."
4303,3,You see I didn't care about the other thing and he could have had it all.
4304,3,He could have had anything he wanted if I would have known.
4305,3,I would have married him or anything.
4306,3,I know all about it now.
4307,3,"But then he wanted to go to war and I didn't know.""I did not say anything.""I didn't know about anything then."
4308,3,I thought it would be worse for him.
4309,3,"I thought perhaps he couldn't stand it and then of course he was killed and that was the end of it.""""I don't know.""""Oh, yes,"" she said."
4310,3,"""That's the end of it.""We looked at Rinaldi talking with the other nurse."
4311,3,"""What is her name?""""Ferguson."
4312,3,Helen Ferguson.
4313,3,"Your friend is a doctor, isn't he?""""Yes."
4314,3,"He's very good.""""That's splendid."
4315,3,You rarely find any one any good this closeto the front.
4316,3,"This is close to the front, isn't it?""""Quite.""""It's a silly front,"" she said."
4317,3,"""But it's very beautiful."
4318,3,"Are they going to have an offensive?""""Yes.""""Then we'll have to work."
4319,3,"There's no work now."" ""Have you done nursing long?""""Since the end of 'fifteen."
4320,3,I started when he did.
4321,3,I remember having a silly idea he might come to the hospital where I was.
4322,3,"With a sabre cut, I suppose, and a bandage around his head."
4323,3,Or shot through the shoulder.
4324,3,"Something picturesque.""""This is the picturesque front,"" I said.""Yes,"" she said."
4325,3,"""People can't realize what France is like."
4326,3,"If they did, it couldn't all go on."
4327,3,He didn't have a sabre cut.
4328,3,"They blew him all to bits.""I didn't say anything.""Do you suppose it will always go on?"" ""No.""""What's to stop it?""""It will crack somewhere.""""We'll crack."
4329,3,We'll crack in France.
4330,3,"They can't go on doing things like the Somme and not crack.""""They won't crack here,"" I said."
4331,3,"""You think not?""""No."
4332,3,"They did very well last summer.""""They may crack,"" she said."
4333,3,"""Anybody may crack."" ""The Germans too.""""No,"" she said."
4334,3,"""I think not.""We went over toward Rinaldi and Miss Ferguson.""You love Italy?"" Rinaldi asked Miss Ferguson in English."
4335,3,"""Quite well.""""No understand,"" Rinaldi shook his head."
4336,3,"""Abbastanza bene,"" I translated.He shook his head.""That is not good."
4337,3,"You love England?"" ""Not too well."
4338,3,"I'm Scotch, you see."" Rinaldi looked at me blankly.""She's Scotch, so she loves Scotland better than England,"" I said in Italian.""But Scotland is England.""I translated this for Miss Ferguson."
4339,3,"""Pas encore,"" said Miss Ferguson."
4340,3,"""Not really?""""Never."
4341,3,"We do not like the English.""""Not like the English? Not like Miss Barkley?""""Oh, that's different."
4342,3,"You mustn't take everything so literally."" After a while we said good-night and left."
4343,3,"Walking homeRinaldi said, ""Miss Barkley prefers you to me."
4344,3,That is very clear.
4345,3,"But the little Scotch one is very nice.""""Very,"" I said."
4346,3,I had not noticed her.
4347,3,"""You like her?"" ""No,"" said Rinaldi.5The next afternoon I went to call on Miss Barkley again."
4348,3,She was not in the garden and I went to the side door of the villa where the ambulances drove up.
4349,3,"Inside I saw the head nurse, who said Miss Barkley was on duty--""there's a war on, you know.""I said I knew.""You're the American in the Italian army?"" she asked."
4350,3,"""Yes, ma'am.""""How did you happen to do that? Why didn't you join up with us?""""I don't know,"" I said."
4351,3,"""Could I join now?""""I'm afraid not now."
4352,3,Tell me.
4353,3,"Why did you join up with the Italians?""""I was in Italy,"" I said, ""and I spoke Italian.""""Oh,"" she said."
4354,3,"""I'm learning it."
4355,3,"It's beautiful language."" ""Somebody said you should be able to learn it in twoweeks.""""Oh, I'll not learn it in two weeks."
4356,3,I've studied it for months now.
4357,3,You may come and see her after seven o'clock if you wish.
4358,3,She'll be off then.
4359,3,"But don't bring a lot of Italians.""""Not even for the beautiful language?"" ""No."
4360,3,"Nor for the beautiful uniforms."" ""Good evening,"" I said.""A rivederci, Tenente.""""A rivederla."" I saluted and went out."
4361,3,"It was impossible to salute foreigners as an Italian, without embarrassment."
4362,3,TheItalian salute never seemed made for export.The day had been hot.
4363,3,I had been up the river to the bridgehead at Plava.
4364,3,It was there that the offensive was to begin.
4365,3,It had been impossible to advance on the far side the year before because there was only one road leading down from the pass to the pontoon bridge and it was under machine- gun and shell fire for nearly a mile.
4366,3,It was not wide enough either to carry all the transport for an offensive and the Austrians could make a shambles out of it.
4367,3,But the Italians had crossed and spread out a little way on the far side to hold about a mile and a half on the Austrian side of the river.
4368,3,It was a nasty place and the Austrians should not have let them hold it.
4369,3,I suppose it was mutual tolerance because the Austrians still kept a bridgehead further down the river.
4370,3,The Austrian trenches were above on the hillside only a few yards from the Italian lines.
4371,3,There had been a little town but it was all rubble.
4372,3,"There was what was left of a railway station and a smashed permanent bridge that could not be repaired and used because it was in plain sight.I went along the narrow road down toward the river, left the car at the dressing station under the hill, crossed the pontoon bridge, which was protected by a shoulder of the mountain, and went through the trenches in the smashed-down town and along the edge of the slope."
4373,3,Everybody was in the dugouts.
4374,3,There were racks of rockets standing to be touched off to call for help from the artillery or to signal with if the telephone wires were cut.
4375,3,"It was quiet, hot and dirty."
4376,3,I looked across the wire at the Austrian lines.
4377,3,Nobody was in sight.
4378,3,I had a drink with a captainthat I knew in one of the dugouts and went back across the bridge.A new wide road was being finished that would go over the mountain and zig-zag down to the bridge.
4379,3,When this road was finished the offensive would start.
4380,3,It came down through the forest in sharp turns.
4381,3,"The system was to bring everything down the new road and take the empty trucks, carts and loaded ambulances and all returning traffic up the old narrow road."
4382,3,The dressing station was on the Austrian side of the river under the edge of the hill and stretcher-bearers would bring the wounded back across the pontoon bridge.
4383,3,It would be the same when the offensive started.
4384,3,As far as I could make out the last mile or so of the new road where it started to level out would be able to be shelled steadily by the Austrians.
4385,3,It looked as though it might be a mess.
4386,3,But I found a place where the cars would be sheltered after they passed that last badlooking bit and could wait for the wounded to be brought across the pontoon bridge.
4387,3,I would have liked to drive over the new road but it was not yet finished.
4388,3,It looked wide and well made with a good grade and the turns looked very impressive where you could see them through openings in the forest on the mountain side.
4389,3,"The cars would be all right with their good metal-to-metal brakes and anyway, coming down, they would not be loaded."
4390,3,I drove back up the narrow road.Two carabinieri held the car up.
4391,3,A shell had fallen and while we waited three others fell up the road.
4392,3,"They were seventy- sevens and came with a whishing rush of air, a hard bright burst and flash and then gray smoke that blew across the road."
4393,3,Thecarabinieri waved us to go on.
4394,3,Passing where the shells had landed I avoided the small broken places and smelled the high explosive and the smell of blasted clay and stone and freshly shattered flint.
4395,3,"I drove back to Gorizia and our villa and, as I said, went to call on Miss Barkley, who was on duty.At dinner I ate very quickly and left for the villa where the British had their hospital."
4396,3,It was really very large and beautiful and there were fine trees in the grounds.
4397,3,Miss Barkley was sitting on a bench in the garden.
4398,3,Miss Ferguson was with her.
4399,3,"They seemed glad to see me and in a little while Miss Ferguson excused herself and went away.""I'll leave you two,"" she said."
4400,3,"""You get along very well without me.""""Don't go, Helen,"" Miss Barkley said.""I'd really rather."
4401,3,"I must write some letters."" ""Good-night,"" I said.""Good-night, Mr."
4402,3,"Henry.""""Don't write anything that will bother the censor.""""Don't worry."
4403,3,"I only write about what a beautiful place we live in and how brave the Italians are.""""That way you'll be decorated.""""That will be nice."
4404,3,"Good-night, Catherine.""""I'll see you in a little while,"" Miss Barkley said."
4405,3,"Miss Ferguson walked away in the dark.""She's nice,"" I said.""Oh, yes, she's very nice."
4406,3,"She's a nurse."" ""Aren't you a nurse?""""Oh, no."
4407,3,I'm something called a V.
4408,3,A.
4409,3,D.
4410,3,"We work very hard but no one trusts us.""""Why not?""""They don't trust us when there's nothing going on."
4411,3,"When there is really work they trust us.""""What is the difference?""""A nurse is like a doctor."
4412,3,It takes a long time to be.
4413,3,A V.
4414,3,A.
4415,3,D.
4416,3,"is a short cut.""""I see.""""The Italians didn't want women so near the front."
4417,3,So we're all on very special behavior.
4418,3,"We don't go out.""""I can come here though.""""Oh, yes."
4419,3,"We're not cloistered."" ""Let's drop the war.""""It's very hard."
4420,3,"There's no place to drop it."" ""Let's drop it anyway.""""All right.""We looked at each other in the dark."
4421,3,I thought she was very beautiful and I took her hand.
4422,3,"She let me take it and I held it and put my arm around under her arm.""No,"" she said."
4423,3,I kept my arm where it was.
4424,3,"""Why not?""""No.""""Yes,"" I said."
4425,3,"""Please."" I leaned forward in the dark to kiss her and there was a sharp stinging flash."
4426,3,She had slapped my face hard.
4427,3,"Her hand had hit my nose and eyes, and tears came in my eyes from the reflex.""I'm so sorry,"" she said."
4428,3,"I felt I had a certain advantage.""You were quite right.""""I'm dreadfully sorry,"" she said."
4429,3,"""I just couldn't stand the nurse's-eveningoff aspect of it."
4430,3,I didn't mean to hurt you.
4431,3,"I did hurt you, didn't I?""She was looking at me in the dark."
4432,3,"I was angry and yet certain, seeing it all ahead like the moves in a chess game.""You did exactly right,"" I said."
4433,3,"""I don't mind at all."" ""Poor man.""""You see I've been leading a sort of a funny life."
4434,3,And I never even talk English.
4435,3,"And then you are so very beautiful."" I looked at her.""You don't need to say a lot of nonsense."
4436,3,"I said I was sorry.We do get along.""""Yes,"" I said."
4437,3,"""And we have gotten away from the war.""She laughed."
4438,3,"It was the first time I had ever heard her laugh.I watched her face.""You are sweet,"" she said."
4439,3,"""No, I'm not.""""Yes."
4440,3,You are a dear.
4441,3,"I'd be glad to kiss you if you don't mind.""I looked in her eyes and put my arm around her as I had before and kissed her."
4442,3,I kissed her hard and held her tight and tried to open her lips; they were closed tight.
4443,3,I was still angry and as I held her suddenly she shivered.
4444,3,"I held her close against me and could feel her heart beating and her lips opened and her head went back against my hand and then she was crying on my shoulder.""Oh, darling,"" she said."
4445,3,"""You will be good to me, won't you?""What the hell, I thought."
4446,3,I stroked her hair and patted her shoulder.
4447,3,"She was crying.""You will, won't you?"" She looked up at me."
4448,3,"""Because we're going to have a strange life.""After a while I walked with her to the door of the villa and she went in and I walked home."
4449,3,Back at the villa I went upstairs to the room.
4450,3,Rinaldi was lying on his bed.
4451,3,"He looked at me.""So you make progress with Miss Barkley?"" ""We are friends.""""You have that pleasant air of a dog in heat."" I did not understand the word.""Of a what?"" He explained.""You,"" I said, ""have that pleasant air of a dog who--"" ""Stop it,"" he said."
4452,3,"""In a little while we would say insultingthings."" He laughed."
4453,3,"""Good-night,"" I said.""Good-night, little puppy.""I knocked over his candle with the pillow and got into bed in the dark.Rinaldi picked up the candle, lit it and went on reading.6I was away for two days at the posts."
4454,3,When I got home it was too late and I did not see Miss Barkley until the next evening.
4455,3,She was not in the garden and I had to wait in the office of the hospital until she came down.
4456,3,There were many marble busts on painted wooden pillars along the walls of the room they used for an office.
4457,3,"The hall too, that the office opened on, was lined with them."
4458,3,They had the complete marble quality of all looking alike.
4459,3,"Sculpture had always seemed a dull business--still, bronzes looked like something."
4460,3,But marble busts all looked like a cemetery.
4461,3,There was one fine cemetery though--the one at Pisa.
4462,3,Genoa was the place to see the bad marbles.
4463,3,This had been the villa of a very wealthy German and the busts must have cost him plenty.
4464,3,I wondered who had done them and how much he got.
4465,3,I tried to make out whether they were members of the family or what; but they were all uniformly classical.
4466,3,You could not tell anything about them.I sat on a chair and held my cap.
4467,3,We were supposed to wear steel helmets even in Gorizia but they were uncomfortable and too bloody theatrical in a town where the civilian inhabitants had not been evacuated.
4468,3,I wore one when we went up to the posts and carried an English gas mask.
4469,3,We were just beginning to get some of them.
4470,3,They were a real mask.
4471,3,Also we were required to wear an automatic pistol; even doctors and sanitary officers.
4472,3,I felt it against the back of the chair.
4473,3,You were liable to arrest if you did not have one worn in plain sight.Rinaldi carried a holster stuffed with toilet paper.
4474,3,I wore a realone and felt like a gunman until I practised firing it.
4475,3,It was an Astra 7.65 caliber with a short barrel and it jumped so sharply when you let it off that there was no question of hitting anything.
4476,3,"I practised with it, holding below the target and trying to master the jerk of the ridiculous short barrel until I could hit within a yard of where I aimed at twenty paces and then the ridiculousness of carrying a pistol at all came over me and I soon forgot it and carried it flopping against the small of my back with no feeling at all except a vague sort of shame when I met English- speaking people."
4477,3,"I sat now in the chair and an orderly of some sort looked at me disapprovingly from behind a desk while I looked at the marble floor, the pillars with the marble busts, and the frescoes on the wall and waited for Miss Barkley."
4478,3,The frescoes were not bad.
4479,3,"Any frescoes were good when they started to peel and flake off.I saw Catherine Barkley coming down the hall, and stood up.She did not seem tall walking toward me but she looked very lovely.""Good-evening, Mr."
4480,3,"Henry,"" she said.""How do you do?"" I said."
4481,3,"The orderly was listening behind the desk.""Shall we sit here or go out in the garden?"" ""Let's go out."
4482,3,"It's much cooler.""I walked behind her out into the garden, the orderly looking after us."
4483,3,"When we were out on the gravel drive she said, ""Where have you been?""""I've been out on post.""""You couldn't have sent me a note?""""No,"" I said."
4484,3,"""Not very well."
4485,3,"I thought I was coming back."" ""You ought to have let me know, darling.""We were off the driveway, walking under the trees."
4486,3,"I took her hands, then stopped and kissed her.""Isn't there anywhere we can go?""""No,"" she said."
4487,3,"""We have to just walk here."
4488,3,"You've been away a long time.""""This is the third day."
4489,3,"But I'm back now."" She looked at me, ""And you do love me?"" ""Yes.""""You did say you loved me, didn't you?""""Yes,"" I lied."
4490,3,"""I love you."" I had not said it before."
4491,3,"""And you call me Catherine?""""Catherine.""We walked on a way and were stopped under a tree."
4492,3,"""Say, 'I've come back to Catherine in the night.""""I've come back to Catherine in the night.""""Oh, darling, you have come back, haven't you?"" ""Yes.""""I love you so and it's been awful."
4493,3,"You won't go away?"" ""No."
4494,3,"I'll always come back.""""Oh, I love you so."
4495,3,"Please put your hand there again."" ""It's not been away."" I turned her so I could see her facewhen I kissed her and I saw that her eyes were shut."
4496,3,I kissed both her shut eyes.
4497,3,I thought she was probably a little crazy.
4498,3,It was all right if she was.
4499,3,I did not care what I was getting into.
4500,3,This was better than going every evening to the house forofficers where the girls climbed all over you and put your cap on backward as a sign of affection between their trips upstairs with brother officers.
4501,3,I knew I did not love Catherine Barkley nor had any idea of loving her.
4502,3,"This was a game, like bridge, in which you said things instead of playing cards."
4503,3,Like bridge you had to pretend you were playing for money or playing for some stakes.
4504,3,Nobody had mentioned what the stakes were.
4505,3,"It was all right with me.""I wish there was some place we could go,"" I said."
4506,3,"I was experiencing the masculine difficulty of making love very long standing up.""There isn't any place,"" she said."
4507,3,"She came back from wherever she had been.""We might sit there just for a little while.""We sat on the flat stone bench and I held Catherine Barkley's hand."
4508,3,"She would not let me put my arm around her.""Are you very tired?"" she asked."
4509,3,"""No.""She looked down at the grass.""This is a rotten game we play, isn't it?"" ""What game?""""Don't be dull.""""I'm not, on purpose.""""You're a nice boy,"" she said."
4510,3,"""And you play it as well as you know how."
4511,3,"But it's a rotten game.""""Do you always know what people think?""""Not always."
4512,3,But I do with you.
4513,3,You don't have to pretend you love me.
4514,3,That's over for the evening.
4515,3,"Is there anything you'd liketo talk about?""""But I do love you.""""Please let's not lie when we don't have to."
4516,3,I had a very fine little show and I'm all right now.
4517,3,You see I'm not mad and I'm not gone off.
4518,3,"It's only a little sometimes.""I pressed her hand, ""Dear Catherine.""""It sounds very funny now--Catherine."
4519,3,You don't pronounce it very much alike.
4520,3,But you're very nice.
4521,3,"You're a very good boy.""""That's what the priest said.""""Yes, you're very good."
4522,3,"And you will come and see me?"" ""Of course.""""And you don't have to say you love me."
4523,3,"That's all over for a while."" She stood up and put out her hand."
4524,3,"""Good-night.""I wanted to kiss her.""No,"" she said."
4525,3,"""I'm awfully tired."" ""Kiss me, though,"" I said.""I'm awfully tired, darling."" ""Kiss me.""""Do you want to very much?"" ""Yes.""We kissed and she broke away suddenly."
4526,3,"""No."
4527,3,"Good-night, please, darling."" We walked to the door and I saw her go in and down the hall."
4528,3,I liked to watch her move.
4529,3,She went on down the hall.
4530,3,I went on home.
4531,3,It was a hot night and there was a good deal going on up in the mountains.
4532,3,I watched the flashes on San Gabriele.I stopped in front of the Villa Rossa.
4533,3,The shutters were upbut it was still going on inside.
4534,3,Somebody was singing.
4535,3,I went on home.
4536,3,"Rinaldi came in while I was undressing.""Ah, ha!"" he said."
4537,3,"""It does not go so well."
4538,3,"Baby is puzzled."" ""Where have you been?""""At the Villa Rossa."
4539,3,"It was very edifying, baby."
4540,3,"We all sang.Where have you been?"" ""Calling on the British.""""Thank God I did not become involved with the British.""7I came back the next afternoon from our first mountain post and stopped the car at the smistimento where the wounded and sick were sorted by their papers and the papers marked for the different hospitals."
4541,3,I had been driving and I sat in the car and the driver took the papers in.
4542,3,It was a hot day and the sky was very bright and blue and the road was white and dusty.
4543,3,I sat in the high seat of the Fiat and thought about nothing.
4544,3,A regiment went by in the road and I watched them pass.
4545,3,The men were hot and sweating.
4546,3,Some wore their steel helmets but most of them carried them slung from their packs.
4547,3,Most of the helmets were too big and came down almost over the ears of the men who wore them.
4548,3,The officers all wore helmets; better-fitting helmets.
4549,3,It was half of the brigata Basilicata.
4550,3,I identified them by their redand white striped collar mark.
4551,3,There were stragglers going by long after the regiment had passed--men who could not keep up with their platoons.
4552,3,"They were sweaty, dusty and tired."
4553,3,Some looked pretty bad.
4554,3,A soldier came along after the last of the stragglers.
4555,3,He was walking with a limp.
4556,3,He stopped and sat down beside the road.
4557,3,"I got down and went over.""What's the matter?""He looked at me, then stood up."
4558,3,"""I'm going on.""""What's the trouble?"" ""-- the war.""""What's wrong with your leg?"" ""It's not my leg."
4559,3,"I got a rupture.""""Why don't you ride with the transport?"" I asked."
4560,3,"""Why don't you go to the hospital?""""They won't let me."
4561,3,"The lieutenant said I slipped the truss on purpose.""""Let me feel it."" ""It's way out.""""Which side is it on?"" ""Here.""I felt it."
4562,3,"""Cough,"" I said.""I'm afraid it will make it bigger."
4563,3,"It's twice as big as it was this morning.""""Sit down,"" I said."
4564,3,"""As soon as I get the papers on these wounded I'll take you along the road and drop you with yourmedical officers.""""He'll say I did it on purpose.""""They can't do anything,"" I said."
4565,3,"""It's not a wound."
4566,3,"You've had it before, haven't you?""""But I lost the truss.""""They'll send you to a hospital."" ""Can't I stay here, Tenente?""""No, I haven't any papers for you.""The driver came out of the door with the papers for the wounded in the car.""Four for 105."
4567,3,"Two for 132,"" he said."
4568,3,"They were hospitals beyond the river.""You drive,"" I said."
4569,3,"I helped the soldier with the rupture up on the seat with us.""You speak English?"" he asked."
4570,3,"""Sure.""""How you like this goddam war?"" ""Rotten.""""I say it's rotten."
4571,3,"Jesus Christ, I say it's rotten."" ""Were you in the States?""""Sure."
4572,3,In Pittsburgh.
4573,3,"I knew you was an American."" ""Don't I talk Italian good enough?""""I knew you was an American all right.""""Another American,"" said the driver in Italian looking at the hernia man.""Listen, lootenant."
4574,3,"Do you have to take me to that regiment?""""Yes.""""Because the captain doctor knew I had this rupture."
4575,3,"I threw away the goddam truss so it would get bad and I wouldn't have to go to the line again.""""I see.""""Couldn't you take me no place else?""""If it was closer to the front I could take you to a first medical post."
4576,3,"But back here you've got to have papers.""""If I go back they'll make me get operated on and then they'll put me in the line all the time.""I thought it over.""You wouldn't want to go in the line all the time, would you?"" he asked.""No.""""Jesus Christ, ain't this a goddam war?""""Listen,"" I said."
4577,3,"""You get out and fall down by the road and get a bump on your head and I'll pick you up on our way back and take you to a hospital."
4578,3,"We'll stop by the road here, Aldo."" We stopped at the side of the road."
4579,3,"I helped him down.""I'll be right here, lieutenant,"" he said.""So long,"" I said."
4580,3,"We went on and passed the regiment about a mile ahead, then crossed the river, cloudy with snow- water and running fast through the spiles of the bridge, to ride along the road across the plain and deliver the wounded at the two hospitals."
4581,3,I drove coming back and went fast with the empty car to find the man from Pittsburgh.
4582,3,"First we passed the regiment, hotter and slower than ever: then the stragglers."
4583,3,Then we saw a horse ambulance stopped by the road.
4584,3,Two menwere lifting the hernia man to put him in.
4585,3,They had come back for him.
4586,3,He shook his head at me.
4587,3,His helmet was off and his forehead was bleeding below the hair line.
4588,3,"His nose was skinned and there was dust on the bloody patch and dust in his hair.""Look at the bump, lieutenant!"" he shouted."
4589,3,"""Nothing to do.They come back for me.""When I got back to the villa it was five o'clock and I went out where we washed the cars, to take a shower."
4590,3,"Then I made out my report in my room, sitting in my trousers and an undershirt in front of the open window."
4591,3,In two days the offensive was to start and I would go with the cars to Plava.
4592,3,It was a long time since I had written to the States and I knew I should write but I had let it go so long that it was almost impossible to write now.
4593,3,There was nothing to write about.
4594,3,"I sent a couple of army Zona di Guerra post-cards, crossing out everything except, I am well.That should handle them."
4595,3,Those post-cards would be very fine in America; strange and mysterious.
4596,3,This was a strange and mysterious war zone but I supposed it was quite well run and grim compared to other wars with the Austrians.
4597,3,The Austrian army was created to give Napoleon victories; any Napoleon.
4598,3,"I wished we had a Napoleon, but instead we had Ii Generale Cadorna, fat and prosperous and Vittorio Emmanuele, the tiny man with the long thin neck and the goat beard."
4599,3,Over on the right they had the Duke of Aosta.
4600,3,Maybe he was too good- looking to be a.
4601,3,great general but he looked like a man.
4602,3,Lots of them would have liked him to be king.
4603,3,He looked like a king.
4604,3,He was the King's uncle and commanded the third army.
4605,3,We werein the second army.
4606,3,There were some British batteries up with the third army.
4607,3,"I had met two gunners from that lot, in Milan."
4608,3,They were very nice and we had a big evening.
4609,3,They were big and shy and embarrassed and very appreciative together of anything that happened.
4610,3,I wish that I was with the British.
4611,3,It would have been much simpler.
4612,3,Still I would probably have been killed.
4613,3,Not in this ambulance business.
4614,3,"Yes, even in the ambulance business."
4615,3,"British ambulance drivers were killed sometimes.Well, I knew I would not be killed."
4616,3,Not in this war.
4617,3,It did not have anything to do with me.
4618,3,It seemed no more dangerous to me myself than war in the movies.
4619,3,I wished to God it was over though.
4620,3,Maybe it would finish this summer.
4621,3,Maybe the Austrians would crack.
4622,3,They had always cracked in other wars.
4623,3,What was the matter with this war? Everybody said the French were through.
4624,3,Rinaldi said that the French had mutinied and troops marched on Paris.
4625,3,"I asked him what happened and he said, ""Oh, they stopped them."" I wanted to go to Austria without war."
4626,3,I wanted to go to the Black Forest.
4627,3,I wanted to go to the Hartz Mountains.Where were the Hartz Mountains anyway? They were fighting in the Carpathians.
4628,3,I did not want to go there anyway.
4629,3,It might be good though.
4630,3,I could go to Spain if there was no war.
4631,3,The sun was going down and the day was cooling off.
4632,3,After supper I would go and see Catherine Barkley.
4633,3,I wish she were here now.
4634,3,I wished I were in Milan with her.
4635,3,I would like to eat at the Cova and then walk down the Via Manzoni in the hot evening and cross over and turn off along the canal and go tothe hotel with Catherine Barkley.
4636,3,Maybe she would.
4637,3,Maybe she would pretend that I was her boy that was killed and we would go in the front door and the porter would take off his cap and I would stop at the concierge's desk and ask for the key and she would stand by the elevator and then we would get in the elevator and it would go up very slowly clicking at all the floors and then our floor and the boy would open the door and stand there and she would step out and I would step out and we would walk down the hall and I would put the key in the door and open it and go in and then take down the telephone and ask them to send a bottle of capri bianca in a silver bucket full of ice and you would hear the ice against the pail coming down the condor and the boy would knock and I would say leave it outside the door please.
4638,3,Because we would not wear any clothes because it was so hot and the window open and the swallows flying over the roofs of the houses and when it was dark afterward and you went to the window very small bats hunting over the houses and close down over the trees and we would drink the capri and the door locked and it hot and only a sheet and the whole night and we would both love each other all night in the hot night in Milan.
4639,3,That was how it ought to be.
4640,3,"I would eat quickly and go and see Catherine Barkley.They talked too much at the mess and I drank wine because tonight we were not all brothers unless I drank a little and talked with the priest about Archbishop Ireland who was, it seemed, a noble man and with whose injustice, the injustices he had received and in which I participated as an American, and of which I had never heard, I feigned acquaintance."
4641,3,"It would havebeen impolite not to have known something of them when I had listened to such a splendid explanation of their causes which were, after all, it seemed, misunderstandings."
4642,3,"I thought he had a fine name and he came from Minnesota which made a lovely name: Ireland of Minnesota, Ireland of Wisconsin, Ireland of Michigan."
4643,3,What made it pretty was that it sounded like Island.No that wasn't it.
4644,3,There was more to it than that.
4645,3,"Yes, father."
4646,3,"That is true, father."
4647,3,"Perhaps, father."
4648,3,"No, father."
4649,3,"Well, maybe yes, father."
4650,3,"You know more about it than I do, father."
4651,3,The priest was good but dull.
4652,3,The officers were not good but dull.
4653,3,The King was good but dull.
4654,3,The wine was bad but not dull.
4655,3,"It took the enamel off your teeth and left it on the roof of your mouth.""And the priest was locked up,"" Rocca said, ""because they found the three per cent bonds on his person."
4656,3,It was in France of course.
4657,3,Here they would never have arrested him.
4658,3,He denied all knowledge of the five per cent bonds.
4659,3,This took place at Bziers.
4660,3,"I was there and reading of it in the paper, went to the jail and asked to see the priest."
4661,3,"It was quite evident he had stolen the bonds.""""I don't believe a word of this,"" Rinaldi said.""Just as you like,"" Rocca said."
4662,3,"""But I am telling it for our priest here."
4663,3,It is very informative.
4664,3,"He is a priest; he will appreciate it.""The priest smiled."
4665,3,"""Go on,"" he said."
4666,3,"""I am listening.""""Of course some of the bonds were not accounted for but the priest had all of the three per cent bonds and several local obligations, I forget exactly what they were."
4667,3,"So I went to the jail,now this is the point of the story, and I stood outside his cell and I said as though I were going to confession, 'Bless me, father, for you have sinned.""There was great laughter from everybody.""And what did he say?"" asked the priest."
4668,3,Rocca ignored this and went on to explain the joke to me.
4669,3,"""You see the point, don't you?"" It seemed it was a very funny joke if you understood it properly."
4670,3,They poured me more wine and I told the story about the English private soldier who was placed under the shower bath.
4671,3,Then the major told the story of the eleven Czecho-slovaks and the Hungarian corporal.
4672,3,After some more wine I told the story of the jockey who found the penny.
4673,3,The major said there was an Italian story something like that about the duchess who could not sleep at night.
4674,3,At this point the priest left and I told the story about the travelling salesman who arrived at five o'clock in the morning at Marseilles when the mistral was blowing.
4675,3,The major said he had heard a report that I could drink.
4676,3,I denied this.
4677,3,He said it was true and by the corpse of Bacchus we would test whether it was true or not.
4678,3,"Not Bacchus, I said."
4679,3,"Not Bachus.Yes, Bacchus, he said."
4680,3,"I should drink cup for cup and glass for glass with Bassi, Fillipo Vincenza."
4681,3,Bassi said no that was no test because he had already drunk twice as much as I.
4682,3,"I said that was a foul lie and, Bacchus or no Bacchus, Fillipo Vincenza Bassi or Bassi Fillippo Vicenza had never touched a drop all evening and what was his name anyway? He said was my name Frederico Enrico or Enrico Federico? I said let the best man win, Bacchus barred, and the major started us with red wine in mugs."
4683,3,Half-way through the wine I did not want anymore.
4684,3,"I remembered where I was going.""Bassi wins,"" I said."
4685,3,"""He's a better man than I am."
4686,3,"I have to go.""""He does really,"" said Rinaldi."
4687,3,"""He has a rendezvous."
4688,3,"I know all about it.""""I have to go.""""Another night,"" said Bassi."
4689,3,"""Another night when you feel stronger."" He slapped me on the shoulder."
4690,3,There were lighted candles on the table.
4691,3,All the officers were very happy.
4692,3,"""Good- night, gentlemen,"" I said.Rinaldi went out with me."
4693,3,"We stood outside the door on the patch and he said, ""You better not go up there drunk.""""I'm not drunk, Rinin."
4694,3,"Really."" ""You'd better chew some coffee."" ""Nonsense.""""I'll get some, baby."
4695,3,"You walk up and down."" He came back with a handful of roasted coffee beans."
4696,3,"""Chew those, baby, and God be with you.""""Bacchus,"" I said.""I'll walk down with you."" ""I'm perfectly all right.""We walked along together through the town and I chewed the coffee."
4697,3,"At the gate of the driveway that led up to the British villa, Rinaldi said good-night.""Good-night,"" I said."
4698,3,"""Why don't you come in?""He shook his head."
4699,3,"""No,"" he said."
4700,3,"""I like the simpler pleasures.""""Thank you for the coffee beans."" ""Nothing, baby."
4701,3,"Nothing.""J started down the driveway."
4702,3,The outlines of the cypresses that lined it were sharp and clear.
4703,3,"I looked back and saw Rinaldi standing watching me and waved to him.I sat in the reception hail of the villa, waiting for Catherine Barkley to come down."
4704,3,Some one was coming down the hallway.
4705,3,"I stood up, but it was not Catherine."
4706,3,"It was Miss Ferguson.""Hello,"" she said."
4707,3,"""Catherine asked me to tell you she was sorry she couldn't see you this evening.""""I'm so sorry."
4708,3,"I hope she's not ill."" ""She's not awfully well.""""Will you tell her how sorry I am?"" ""Yes, I will.""""Do you think it would be any good to try and see her tomorrow?""""Yes, I do.""""Thank you very much,"" I said."
4709,3,"""Good-night.""I went out the door and suddenly I felt lonely and empty."
4710,3,"I had treated seeing Catherine very lightly, I had gotten somewhat drunk and had nearly forgotten to come but when I could not see her there I was feeling lonely and hollow.8The next afternoon we heard there was to be an attack up the river that night and that we were to take four cars there."
4711,3,Nobody knew anything about it although they all spoke with great positiveness and strategical knowledge.
4712,3,I was riding in the first car and as we passed the entry to the British hospital I told the driver to stop.
4713,3,The other cars pulled up.
4714,3,I got out and told the driver to go on and that if we had not caught up to them at the junction of the road to Cormons to wait there.
4715,3,"I hurried up the driveway and inside the reception hall I asked for Miss Barkley.""She's on duty.""""Could I see her just for a moment?""They sent an orderly to see and she came back with him."
4716,3,"""I stopped to ask if you were better."
4717,3,"They told me you wereon duty, so I asked to see you.""""I'm quite well,"" she said, ""I think the heat knocked me over yesterday.""""I have to go.""""I'll just step out the door a minute."" ""And you're all right?"" I asked outside."
4718,3,"""Yes, darling."
4719,3,"Are you coming to-night?""""No."
4720,3,"I'm leaving now for a show up above Plava."" ""A show?""""I don't think it's anything."" ""And you'll be back?""""To-morrow.""She was unclasping something from her neck."
4721,3,She put it in my hand.
4722,3,"""It's a Saint Anthony,"" she said."
4723,3,"""And come to-morrow night.""""You're not a Catholic, are you?""""No."
4724,3,"But they say a Saint Anthony's very useful."" ""I'll take care of him for you."
4725,3,"Good-by.""""No,"" she said, ""not good-by."" ""All right.""""Be a good boy and be careful."
4726,3,"No, you can't kiss me here.You can't.""""All right.""I looked back and saw her standing on the steps."
4727,3,She waved and I kissed my hand and held it out.
4728,3,She waved again and then I was out of the driveway and climbing up into the seat of the ambulance and we started.
4729,3,The Saint Anthony was in a little white metal capsule.
4730,3,"I opened the capsule and spilled him out into my hand.""Saint Anthony?"" asked the driver."
4731,3,"""Yes.""""I have one."" His right hand left the wheel and opened a button on his tunic and pulled it out from under his shirt.""See?""I put my Saint Anthony back in the capsule, spilled the thin gold chain together and put it all in my breast pocket.""You don't wear him?"" ""No.""""It's better to wear him."
4732,3,"That's what it's for.""""All right,"" I said."
4733,3,I undid the clasp of the gold chain and put it around my neck and clasped it.
4734,3,"The saint hung down on the Outside of my uniform and I undid the throat of my tunic, unbuttoned the shirt collar and dropped him in under the shirt."
4735,3,I felt him in his metal box against my chest while we drove.
4736,3,Then I forgot about him.
4737,3,After I was wounded I never found him.
4738,3,Some one probably got it at one of the dressing stations.We drove fast when we were over the bridge and soon we saw the dust of the other cars ahead down the road.
4739,3,"The road curved and we saw the three cars looking quite small, the dust rising from the wheels and going off through the trees."
4740,3,We caught them and passed them and turned off on a road that climbed up into the hills.
4741,3,Driving in convoy is not unpleasant if you are the first car and I settled back in the seat and watched the country.
4742,3,We were in the foothills on the near side of the river and as the road mounted there were the high mountains off to the north with snow still on the tops.
4743,3,"I looked back and saw the three cars all climbing, spaced by the interval of their dust."
4744,3,"We passed a long column of loaded mules, the drivers walking along beside the mules wearing red fezzes."
4745,3,They were bersaglieri.Beyond the mule train the road was empty and we climbed through the hills and then went down over the shoulder of a long hill into a river-valley.
4746,3,"There were trees along both sides of the road and through the right line of trees I saw the river, the water clear, fast and shallow."
4747,3,The river was low and there were stretches of sand and pebbles with a narrow channel of waterand sometimes the water spread like a sheen over the pebbly bed.
4748,3,"Close to the bank I saw deep pools, the water blue like the sky."
4749,3,I saw arched stone bridges over the river where tracks turned off from the road and we passed stone farmhouses with pear trees candelabraed against their south walls and low stone walls in the fields.
4750,3,The road went up the valley a long way and then we turned off and commenced to climb into the hills again.
4751,3,The road climbed steeply going up and back and forth through chestnut woods to level finally along a ridge.
4752,3,"I could look down through the woods and see, far below, with the sun on it, the line of the river that separated the two armies."
4753,3,"We went along the rough new military road that followed the crest of the ridge and I looked to the north at the two ranges of mountains, green and dark to the snow-line and then white and lovely in the sun."
4754,3,"Then, as the road mounted along the ridge, I saw a third range of mountains, higher snow mountains, that looked chalky white and furrowed, with strange planes, and then there were mountains far off beyond all these that you could hardly tell if you really saw."
4755,3,Those were all the Austrians' mountains and we had nothing like them.
4756,3,Ahead there was a rounded turn-off in the road to the right and looking down I could see the road dropping through the trees.
4757,3,"There were troops on this road and motor trucks and mules with mountain guns and as we went down, keeping to the side, I could see the river far down below, the line of ties and rails running along it, the old bridge where the railway crossed to the other side and across, under a hill beyond the river, the broken houses of the little town that was to be taken.It was nearly dark when we came down and turned onto the main road that ran beside the river.9The road was crowded and there were screens of corn-stalk and straw matting on both sides and matting over the top so that it was like the entrance at a circus or a native village."
4758,3,We drove slowly in this matting-covered tunnel and came out onto a bare cleared space where the railway station had been.
4759,3,The road here was below the level of the river bank and all along the side of the sunken road there were holes dug in the bank with infantry in them.
4760,3,The sun was going down and looking up along the bank as we drove I saw the Austrian observation balloons above the hills on the other side dark against the sunset.
4761,3,We parked the cars beyond a brickyard.
4762,3,The ovens and some deep holes had been equipped as dressing stations.
4763,3,There were three doctors that I knew.
4764,3,I talked with the major and learned that when it should start and our cars should be loaded we would drive them back along the screened road and up to the main road along the ridge where there would be a post and other cars to clear them.
4765,3,He hoped the road would not jam.
4766,3,It was a one-road show.
4767,3,The road was screened because it was in sightof the Austrians across the river.
4768,3,Here at the brickyard we were sheltered from rifle or machine-gun fire by the river bank.
4769,3,There was one smashed bridge across the river.
4770,3,They were going to put over another bridge when the bombardment started and some troops were to cross at the shallows up above at the bend of the river.
4771,3,The major was a little man with upturned mustaches.
4772,3,He had been in the war in Libya and wore two woundstripes.
4773,3,He said that if the thing went well he would see that I was decorated.
4774,3,I said I hoped it would go well but that he was too kind.
4775,3,I asked him if there was a big dugout where the drivers could stay and he sent a soldier to show me.
4776,3,"I went with him and found the dugout, which was very good."
4777,3,The drivers were pleased with it and I left them there.
4778,3,The major asked me to have a drink with him and two other officers.
4779,3,We drank rum and it was very friendly.
4780,3,Outside it was getting dark.
4781,3,I asked what time the attack was to he and they said as soon as it was dark.
4782,3,I went back to the drivers.
4783,3,They were sitting in the dugout talking and when I came in they stopped.
4784,3,"I gave them each a package of cigarettes, Macedonias, loosely packed cigarettes that spilled tobacco and needed to have the ends twisted before you smoked them."
4785,3,Manera lit his lighter and passed it around.
4786,3,The lighter was shaped like a Fiat radiator.
4787,3,"I told them what I had heard.""Why didn't we see the post when we came down?"" Passini asked.""It was just beyond where we turned off."" ""That road will be a dirty mess,"" Manera said."
4788,3,"""They'll shell the	out of us.""""Probably.""""What about eating, lieutenant? We won't get a chance to eat after this thing starts.""""I'll go and see now,"" I said.""You want us to stay here or can we look around?"" ""Better stay here.""I went back to the major's dugout and he said the field kitchen would be along and the drivers could come and get their stew."
4789,3,He would loan them mess tins if they did not have them.
4790,3,I said I thought they had them.
4791,3,I went back and told the drivers I would get them as soon as the food came.
4792,3,Manera said he hoped it would come before the bombardment started.
4793,3,They were silent until I went out.
4794,3,They were all mechanics and hated the war.I went out to look at the cars and see what was going on and then came back and sat down in the dugout with the four drivers.
4795,3,We sat on the ground with our backs against the wall and smoked.
4796,3,Outside it was nearly dark.
4797,3,"The earth of the dugout was warm and dry and I let my shoulders back against the wall, sitting on the small of my back, and relaxed.""Who goes to the attack?"" asked Gavuzzi."
4798,3,"""Bersaglieri.""""All bersaglieri?"" ""I think so.""""There aren't enough troops here for a real attack.""""It is probably to draw attention from where the real attack will be.""""Do the men know that who attack?"" ""I don't think so.""""Of course they don't,"" Manera said."
4799,3,"""They wouldn't attack if they did.""""Yes, they would,"" Passini said."
4800,3,"""Bersaglieri are fools."" ""They are brave and have good discipline,"" I said."
4801,3,"""They are big through the chest by measurement, andhealthy."
4802,3,"But they are still fools.""""The granatieri are tall,"" Manera said."
4803,3,This was a joke.
4804,3,"They all laughed.""Were you there, Tenente, when they wouldn't attack and they shot every tenth man?""""No.""""It is true."
4805,3,They lined them up afterward and took every tenth man.
4806,3,"Carabinieri shot them.""""Carabinieri,"" said Passini and spat on the floor."
4807,3,"""But those grenadiers; all over six feet."
4808,3,"They wouldn't attack.""""If everybody would not attack the war would be over,"" Manera said.""It wasn't that way with the granatieri."
4809,3,They were afraid.
4810,3,"The officers all came from such good families.""""Some of the officers went alone.""""A sergeant shot two officers who would not get out."" ""Some troops went out.""""Those that went out were not lined up when they took the tenth men.""""One of those shot by the carabinieri is from my town,"" Passini said."
4811,3,"""He was a big smart tall boy to be in thegranatieri."
4812,3,Always in Rome.
4813,3,Always with the girls.
4814,3,"Always with the carabinieri."" He laughed."
4815,3,"""Now they have a guard outside his house with a bayonet and nobody can come to see his mother and father and sisters and his father loses his civil rights and cannot even vote."
4816,3,They are all without law to protect them.
4817,3,"Anybody can take their property.""""If it wasn't that that happens to their families nobody would go to the attack.""""Yes."
4818,3,Alpini would.

4821,3,soldiers would.
4822,3,"Some bersaglieri.""""Bersaglieri have run too."
4823,3,"Now they try to forget it."" ""You should not let us talk this way, Tenente."
4824,3,"Evvival'esercito,"" Passini said sarcastically.""I know how you talk,"" I said."
4825,3,"""But as long as you drive the cars and behave--""""--and don't talk so other officers can hear,"" Manera finished."
4826,3,"""I believe we should get the war over,"" I said."
4827,3,"""It would not finish it if one side stopped fighting."
4828,3,"It would only be worse if we stopped fighting.""""It could not be worse,"" Passini said respectfully."
4829,3,"""There is nothing worse than war.""""Defeat is worse.""""I do not believe it,"" Passini said still respectfully."
4830,3,"""What is defeat? You go home.""""They come after you."
4831,3,They take your home.
4832,3,"They take your sisters.""""I don't believe it,"" Passini said."
4833,3,"""They can't do that toeverybody."
4834,3,Let everybody defend his home.
4835,3,"Let them keep their sisters in the house.""""They hang you."
4836,3,They come and make you be a soldier again.
4837,3,"Not in the auto-ambulance, in the infantry.""""They can't hang every one.""""An outside nation can't make you be a soldier,"" Manera said."
4838,3,"""At the first battle you all run.""""Like the Tchecos.""""I think you do not know anything about being conquered and so you think it is not bad.""""Tenente,"" Passini said."
4839,3,"""We understand you let us talk.Listen."
4840,3,There is nothing as bad as war.
4841,3,We in the auto- ambulance cannot even realize at all how bad it is.
4842,3,When people realize how bad it is they cannot do anything to stop it because they go crazy.
4843,3,There are some people who never realize.
4844,3,There are people who are afraid of their officers.
4845,3,"It is with them the war is made.""""I know it is bad but we must finish it.""""It doesn't finish."
4846,3,"There is no finish to a war."" ""Yes there is.""Passini shook his head.""War is not won by victory."
4847,3,What if we take San Gabriele? What if we take the Carso and Monfalcone and Trieste? Where are we then? Did you see all the far mountains to-day? Do you think we could take all them too? Only if the Austrians stop fighting.
4848,3,One side must stop fighting.
4849,3,Why don't we stop fighting? If they come down into Italy they will get tired and go away.
4850,3,They have their own country.
4851,3,"But no, instead there is awar.""""You're an orator.""""We think."
4852,3,We read.
4853,3,We are not peasants.
4854,3,We are mechanics.
4855,3,But even the peasants know better than to believe in a war.
4856,3,"Everybody hates this war.""""There is a class that controls a country that is stupid and does not realize anything and never can."
4857,3,"That is why we have this war.""""Also they make money out of it.""""Most of them don't,"" said Passini."
4858,3,"""They are too stupid.They do it for nothing."
4859,3,"For stupidity.""""We must shut up,"" said Manera."
4860,3,"""We talk too much even for the Tenente.""""He likes it,"" said Passini."
4861,3,"""We will convert him."" ""But now we will shut up,"" Manera said.""Do we eat yet, Tenente?"" Gavuzzi asked.""I will go and see,"" I said."
4862,3,"Gordini stood up and went outside with me.""Is there anything I can do, Tenente? Can I help in any way?"" He was the quietest one of the four."
4863,3,"""Come with me if you want,"" I said, ""and we'll see.""It was dark outside and the long light from the search-lights was moving over the mountains."
4864,3,"There were big search-lights on that front mounted on camions that you passed sometimes on the roads at night, close behind the lines, the camion stopped a little off the road, an officer directing the light and the crew scared."
4865,3,"We crossed the brickyard, and stopped at themain dressing station."
4866,3,There was a little shelter of green branches outside over the entrance and in the dark the night wind rustled the leaves dried by the sun.
4867,3,Inside there was a light.
4868,3,The major was at the telephone sitting on a box.
4869,3,One of the medical captains said the attack had been put forward an hour.
4870,3,He offered me a glass of cognac.
4871,3,"I looked at the board tables, the instruments shining in the light, the basins and the stoppered bottles."
4872,3,Gordini stood behind me.
4873,3,"The major got up from the telephone.""It starts now,"" he said."
4874,3,"""It has been put back again.""I looked outside, it was dark and the Austrian search-lights were moving on the mountains behind us."
4875,3,"It was quiet for a moment still, then from all the guns behind us the bombardment started.""Savoia,"" said the major.""About the soup, major,"" I said."
4876,3,He did not hear me.
4877,3,"I repeated it.""It hasn't come up.""A big shell came in and burst outside in the brickyard.Another burst and in the noise you could hear the smaller noise of the brick and dirt raining down.""What is there to eat?""""We have a little pasta asciutta,"" the major said."
4878,3,"""I'll take what you can give me.""The major spoke to an orderly who went out of sight in the back and came back with a metal basin of cold cooked macaroni."
4879,3,"I handed it to Gordini.""Have you any cheese?""The major spoke grudgingly to the orderly who ducked back into the hole again and came out with a quarter of a white cheese.""Thank you very much,"" I said."
4880,3,"""You'd better not go out.""Outside something was set down beside the entrance."
4881,3,"One of the two men who had carried it looked in.""Bring him in,"" said the major."
4882,3,"""What's the matter with you?Do you want us to come outside and get him?""The two stretcher-bearers picked up the man under the arms and by the legs and brought him in.""Slit the tunic,"" the major said.He held a forceps with some gauze in the end."
4883,3,The two captains took off their coats.
4884,3,"""Get out of here,"" the major said to the two stretcher-bearers.""Come on,"" I said to Gordini.""You better wait until the shelling is over,"" the major said over his shoulder.""They want to eat,"" I said."
4885,3,"""As you wish.""Outside we ran across the brickyard."
4886,3,A shell burst short near the river bank.
4887,3,Then there was one that we did not hear coming until the sudden rush.
4888,3,We both went flat and with the flash and bump of the burst and the smell heard the singing off of the fragments and the rattle of falling brick.
4889,3,Gordini got up and ran for the dugout.
4890,3,"I was after him, holding the cheese, its smooth surface covered with brick dust."
4891,3,"Inside the dugout were thethree drivers sitting against the wall, smoking."
4892,3,"""Here, you patriots,"" I said.""How are the cars?"" Manera asked."
4893,3,"""All right.""""Did they scare you, Tenente?"" ""You're damned right,"" I said.I took out my knife, opened it, wiped off the blade and pared off the dirty outside surface of the cheese."
4894,3,"Gavuzzi handed me the basin of macaroni.""Start in to eat, Tenente.""""No,"" I said."
4895,3,"""Put it on the floor."

4897,3,Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton.
4898,3,"Do notthink that I am very much impressed by that as a boxing title, but itmeant a lot to Cohn."
4899,3,"He cared nothing for boxing, in fact he dislikedit, but he learned it painfully and thoroughly to counteract the feelingof inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew atPrinceton."
4900,3,"There was a certain inner comfort in knowing he could knockdown anybody who was snooty to him, although, being very shy and athoroughly nice boy, he never fought except in the gym."
4901,3,He was SpiderKelly’s star pupil.
4902,3,"Spider Kelly taught all his young gentlemen to boxlike featherweights, no matter whether they weighed one hundred and fiveor two hundred and five pounds."
4903,3,But it seemed to fit Cohn.
4904,3,He was reallyvery fast.
4905,3,He was so good that Spider promptly overmatched him and gothis nose permanently flattened.
4906,3,"This increased Cohn’s distaste forboxing, but it gave him a certain satisfaction of some strange sort, andit certainly improved his nose."
4907,3,In his last year at Princeton he readtoo much and took to wearing spectacles.
4908,3,I never met any one of hisclass who remembered him.
4909,3,"They did not even remember that he wasmiddleweight boxing champion.I mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their storieshold together, and I always had a suspicion that perhaps Robert Cohn hadnever been middleweight boxing champion, and that perhaps a horse hadstepped on his face, or that maybe his mother had been frightened orseen something, or that he had, maybe, bumped into something as a youngchild, but I finally had somebody verify the story from Spider Kelly.Spider Kelly not only remembered Cohn."
4910,3,"He had often wondered what hadbecome of him.Robert Cohn was a member, through his father, of one of the richestJewish families in New York, and through his mother of one of theoldest."
4911,3,"At the military school where he prepped for Princeton, andplayed a very good end on the football team, no one had made himrace-conscious."
4912,3,"No one had ever made him feel he was a Jew, and henceany different from anybody else, until he went to Princeton."
4913,3,"He was anice boy, a friendly boy, and very shy, and it made him bitter."
4914,3,"He tookit out in boxing, and he came out of Princeton with painfulself-consciousness and the flattened nose, and was married by the firstgirl who was nice to him."
4915,3,"He was married five years, had three children,lost most of the fifty thousand dollars his father left him, the balanceof the estate having gone to his mother, hardened into a ratherunattractive mould under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife; and justwhen he had made up his mind to leave his wife she left him and went offwith a miniature-painter."
4916,3,"As he had been thinking for months aboutleaving his wife and had not done it because it would be too cruel todeprive her of himself, her departure was a very healthful shock.The divorce was arranged and Robert Cohn went out to the Coast."
4917,3,"InCalifornia he fell among literary people and, as he still had a littleof the fifty thousand left, in a short time he was backing a review ofthe Arts."
4918,3,"The review commenced publication in Carmel, California, andfinished in Provincetown, Massachusetts."
4919,3,"By that time Cohn, who had beenregarded purely as an angel, and whose name had appeared on theeditorial page merely as a member of the advisory board, had become thesole editor."
4920,3,It was his money and he discovered he liked the authorityof editing.
4921,3,"He was sorry when the magazine became too expensive and hehad to give it up.By that time, though, he had other things to worry about."
4922,3,He had beentaken in hand by a lady who hoped to rise with the magazine.
4923,3,"She wasvery forceful, and Cohn never had a chance of not being taken in hand.Also he was sure that he loved her."
4924,3,"When this lady saw that the magazinewas not going to rise, she became a little disgusted with Cohn anddecided that she might as well get what there was to get while there wasstill something available, so she urged that they go to Europe, whereCohn could write."
4925,3,"They came to Europe, where the lady had been educated,and stayed three years."
4926,3,"During these three years, the first spent intravel, the last two in Paris, Robert Cohn had two friends, Braddocksand myself."
4927,3,Braddocks was his literary friend.
4928,3,"I was his tennis friend.The lady who had him, her name was Frances, found toward the end of thesecond year that her looks were going, and her attitude toward Robertchanged from one of careless possession and exploitation to the absolutedetermination that he should marry her."
4929,3,"During this time Robert’s motherhad settled an allowance on him, about three hundred dollars a month.During two years and a half I do not believe that Robert Cohn looked atanother woman."
4930,3,"He was fairly happy, except that, like many people livingin Europe, he would rather have been in America, and he had discoveredwriting."
4931,3,"He wrote a novel, and it was not really such a bad novel as thecritics later called it, although it was a very poor novel."
4932,3,"He read manybooks, played bridge, played tennis, and boxed at a local gymnasium.I first became aware of his lady’s attitude toward him one night afterthe three of us had dined together."
4933,3,We had dined at l’Avenue’s andafterward went to the Café de Versailles for coffee.
4934,3,"We had several_fines_ after the coffee, and I said I must be going."
4935,3,Cohn had beentalking about the two of us going off somewhere on a weekend trip.
4936,3,Hewanted to get out of town and get in a good walk.
4937,3,"I suggested we fly toStrasbourg and walk up to Saint Odile, or somewhere or other in Alsace.“I know a girl in Strasbourg who can show us the town,” I said.Somebody kicked me under the table."
4938,3,I thought it was accidental and wenton: “She’s been there two years and knows everything there is to knowabout the town.
4939,3,"She’s a swell girl.”I was kicked again under the table and, looking, saw Frances, Robert’slady, her chin lifting and her face hardening.“Hell,” I said, “why go to Strasbourg? We could go up to Bruges, or tothe Ardennes.”Cohn looked relieved."
4940,3,I was not kicked again.
4941,3,I said good-night and wentout.
4942,3,Cohn said he wanted to buy a paper and would walk to the cornerwith me.
4943,3,"“For God’s sake,” he said, “why did you say that about thatgirl in Strasbourg for? Didn’t you see Frances?”“No, why should I? If I know an American girl that lives in Strasbourgwhat the hell is it to Frances?”“It doesn’t make any difference."
4944,3,Any girl.
4945,3,"I couldn’t go, that would beall.”“Don’t be silly.”“You don’t know Frances."
4946,3,Any girl at all.
4947,3,"Didn’t you see the way shelooked?”“Oh, well,” I said, “let’s go to Senlis.”“Don’t get sore.”“I’m not sore."
4948,3,"Senlis is a good place and we can stay at the Grand Cerfand take a hike in the woods and come home.”“Good, that will be fine.”“Well, I’ll see you to-morrow at the courts,” I said.“Good-night, Jake,” he said, and started back to the café.“You forgot to get your paper,” I said.“That’s so.” He walked with me up to the kiosque at the corner."
4949,3,"“You arenot sore, are you, Jake?” He turned with the paper in his hand.“No, why should I be?”“See you at tennis,” he said."
4950,3,I watched him walk back to the caféholding his paper.
4951,3,I rather liked him and evidently she led him quite alife.
4952,3,"                               CHAPTER                                   2That winter Robert Cohn went over to America with his novel, and it wasaccepted by a fairly good publisher."
4953,3,"His going made an awful row Iheard, and I think that was where Frances lost him, because severalwomen were nice to him in New York, and when he came back he was quitechanged."
4954,3,"He was more enthusiastic about America than ever, and he wasnot so simple, and he was not so nice."
4955,3,The publishers had praised hisnovel pretty highly and it rather went to his head.
4956,3,"Then several womenhad put themselves out to be nice to him, and his horizons had allshifted."
4957,3,For four years his horizon had been absolutely limited to hiswife.
4958,3,"For three years, or almost three years, he had never seen beyondFrances."
4959,3,"I am sure he had never been in love in his life.He had married on the rebound from the rotten time he had in college,and Frances took him on the rebound from his discovery that he had notbeen everything to his first wife."
4960,3,"He was not in love yet but herealized that he was an attractive quantity to women, and that the factof a woman caring for him and wanting to live with him was not simply adivine miracle."
4961,3,This changed him so that he was not so pleasant to havearound.
4962,3,"Also, playing for higher stakes than he could afford in somerather steep bridge games with his New York connections, he had heldcards and won several hundred dollars."
4963,3,"It made him rather vain of hisbridge game, and he talked several times of how a man could always makea living at bridge if he were ever forced to.Then there was another thing."
4964,3,He had been reading W.
4965,3,H.
4966,3,Hudson.
4967,3,"Thatsounds like an innocent occupation, but Cohn had read and reread “ThePurple Land.” “The Purple Land” is a very sinister book if read too latein life."
4968,3,"It recounts splendid imaginary amorous adventures of a perfectEnglish gentleman in an intensely romantic land, the scenery of which isvery well described."
4969,3,"For a man to take it at thirty-four as a guide-bookto what life holds is about as safe as it would be for a man of the sameage to enter Wall Street direct from a French convent, equipped with acomplete set of the more practical Alger books."
4970,3,"Cohn, I believe, tookevery word of “The Purple Land” as literally as though it had been anR."
4971,3,G.
4972,3,Dun report.
4973,3,"You understand me, he made some reservations, but onthe whole the book to him was sound."
4974,3,It was all that was needed to sethim off.
4975,3,"I did not realize the extent to which it had set him off untilone day he came into my office.“Hello, Robert,” I said."
4976,3,"“Did you come in to cheer me up?”“Would you like to go to South America, Jake?” he asked.“No.”“Why not?”“I don’t know."
4977,3,I never wanted to go.
4978,3,Too expensive.
4979,3,"You can see all theSouth Americans you want in Paris anyway.”“They’re not the real South Americans.”“They look awfully real to me.”I had a boat train to catch with a week’s mail stories, and only half ofthem written.“Do you know any dirt?” I asked.“No.”“None of your exalted connections getting divorces?”“No; listen, Jake."
4980,3,"If I handled both our expenses, would you go to SouthAmerica with me?”“Why me?”“You can talk Spanish."
4981,3,"And it would be more fun with two of us.”“No,” I said, “I like this town and I go to Spain in the summer-time.”“All my life I’ve wanted to go on a trip like that,” Cohn said."
4982,3,He satdown.
4983,3,"“I’ll be too old before I can ever do it.”“Don’t be a fool,” I said."
4984,3,“You can go anywhere you want.
4985,3,You’ve gotplenty of money.”“I know.
4986,3,"But I can’t get started.”“Cheer up,” I said."
4987,3,“All countries look just like the moving pictures.”But I felt sorry for him.
4988,3,He had it badly.“I can’t stand it to think my life is going so fast and I’m not reallyliving it.”“Nobody ever lives their life all the way up except bull-fighters.”“I’m not interested in bull-fighters.
4989,3,That’s an abnormal life.
4990,3,I want togo back in the country in South America.
4991,3,"We could have a great trip.”“Did you ever think about going to British East Africa to shoot?”“No, I wouldn’t like that.”“I’d go there with you.”“No; that doesn’t interest me.”“That’s because you never read a book about it."
4992,3,"Go on and read a bookall full of love affairs with the beautiful shiny black princesses.”“I want to go to South America.”He had a hard, Jewish, stubborn streak.“Come on down-stairs and have a drink.”“Aren’t you working?”“No,” I said."
4993,3,We went down the stairs to the café on the ground floor.
4994,3,Ihad discovered that was the best way to get rid of friends.
4995,3,"Once you hada drink all you had to say was: “Well, I’ve got to get back and get offsome cables,” and it was done."
4996,3,"It is very important to discover gracefulexits like that in the newspaper business, where it is such an importantpart of the ethics that you should never seem to be working."
4997,3,"Anyway, wewent down-stairs to the bar and had a whiskey and soda."
4998,3,Cohn looked atthe bottles in bins around the wall.
4999,3,"“This is a good place,” he said.“There’s a lot of liquor,” I agreed.“Listen, Jake,” he leaned forward on the bar."
5000,3,"“Don’t you ever get thefeeling that all your life is going by and you’re not taking advantageof it? Do you realize you’ve lived nearly half the time you have to livealready?”“Yes, every once in a while.”“Do you know that in about thirty-five years more we’ll be dead?”“What the hell, Robert,” I said."
5001,3,"“What the hell.”“I’m serious.”“It’s one thing I don’t worry about,” I said.“You ought to.”“I’ve had plenty to worry about one time or other."
5002,3,"I’m throughworrying.”“Well, I want to go to South America.”“Listen, Robert, going to another country doesn’t make any difference.I’ve tried all that."
5003,3,You can’t get away from yourself by moving from oneplace to another.
5004,3,There’s nothing to that.”“But you’ve never been to South America.”“South America hell! If you went there the way you feel now it would beexactly the same.
5005,3,This is a good town.
5006,3,"Why don’t you start living yourlife in Paris?”“I’m sick of Paris, and I’m sick of the Quarter.”“Stay away from the Quarter."
5007,3,Cruise around by yourself and see whathappens to you.”“Nothing happens to me.
5008,3,I walked alone all one night and nothinghappened except a bicycle cop stopped me and asked to see my papers.”“Wasn’t the town nice at night?”“I don’t care for Paris.”So there you were.
5009,3,"I was sorry for him, but it was not a thing you coulddo anything about, because right away you ran up against the twostubbornnesses: South America could fix it and he did not like Paris."
5010,3,"Hegot the first idea out of a book, and I suppose the second came out of abook too.“Well,” I said, “I’ve got to go up-stairs and get off some cables.”“Do you really have to go?”“Yes, I’ve got to get these cables off.”“Do you mind if I come up and sit around the office?”“No, come on up.”He sat in the outer room and read the papers, and the Editor andPublisher and I worked hard for two hours."
5011,3,"Then I sorted out thecarbons, stamped on a by-line, put the stuff in a couple of big manilaenvelopes and rang for a boy to take them to the Gare St."
5012,3,Lazare.
5013,3,I wentout into the other room and there was Robert Cohn asleep in the bigchair.
5014,3,He was asleep with his head on his arms.
5015,3,"I did not like to wakehim up, but I wanted to lock the office and shove off."
5016,3,I put my hand onhis shoulder.
5017,3,He shook his head.
5018,3,"“I can’t do it,” he said, and put hishead deeper into his arms."
5019,3,“I can’t do it.
5020,3,"Nothing will make me do it.”“Robert,” I said, and shook him by the shoulder."
5021,3,He looked up.
5022,3,He smiledand blinked.“Did I talk out loud just then?”“Something.
5023,3,"But it wasn’t clear.”“God, what a rotten dream!”“Did the typewriter put you to sleep?”“Guess so."
5024,3,"I didn’t sleep all last night.”“What was the matter?”“Talking,” he said.I could picture it."
5025,3,I have a rotten habit of picturing the bedroomscenes of my friends.
5026,3,We went out to the Café Napolitain to have an_apéritif_ and watch the evening crowd on the Boulevard.
5027,3,"                               CHAPTER                                   3It was a warm spring night and I sat at a table on the terrace of theNapolitain after Robert had gone, watching it get dark and the electricsigns come on, and the red and green stop-and-go traffic-signal, and thecrowd going by, and the horse-cabs clippety-clopping along at the edgeof the solid taxi traffic, and the _poules_ going by, singly and inpairs, looking for the evening meal."
5028,3,"I watched a good-looking girl walkpast the table and watched her go up the street and lost sight of her,and watched another, and then saw the first one coming back again."
5029,3,"Shewent by once more and I caught her eye, and she came over and sat downat the table."
5030,3,"The waiter came up.“Well, what will you drink?” I asked.“Pernod.”“That’s not good for little girls.”“Little girl yourself."
5031,3,"Dites garçon, un pernod.”“A pernod for me, too.”“What’s the matter?” she asked."
5032,3,“Going on a party?”“Sure.
5033,3,Aren’t you?”“I don’t know.
5034,3,"You never know in this town.”“Don’t you like Paris?”“No.”“Why don’t you go somewhere else?”“Isn’t anywhere else.”“You’re happy, all right.”“Happy, hell!”Pernod is greenish imitation absinthe."
5035,3,When you add water it turnsmilky.
5036,3,"It tastes like licorice and it has a good uplift, but it dropsyou just as far."
5037,3,"We sat and drank it, and the girl looked sullen.“Well,” I said, “are you going to buy me a dinner?”She grinned and I saw why she made a point of not laughing."
5038,3,With hermouth closed she was a rather pretty girl.
5039,3,I paid for the saucers and wewalked out to the street.
5040,3,I hailed a horse-cab and the driver pulled upat the curb.
5041,3,"Settled back in the slow, smoothly rolling _fiacre_ wemoved up the Avenue de l’Opéra, passed the locked doors of the shops,their windows lighted, the Avenue broad and shiny and almost deserted.The cab passed the New York _Herald_ bureau with the window full ofclocks.“What are all the clocks for?” she asked.“They show the hour all over America.”“Don’t kid me.”We turned off the Avenue up the Rue des Pyramides, through the trafficof the Rue de Rivoli, and through a dark gate into the Tuileries."
5042,3,Shecuddled against me and I put my arm around her.
5043,3,She looked up to bekissed.
5044,3,She touched me with one hand and I put her hand away.“Never mind.”“What’s the matter? You sick?”“Yes.”“Everybody’s sick.
5045,3,"I’m sick, too.”We came out of the Tuileries into the light and crossed the Seine andthen turned up the Rue des Saints Pères.“You oughtn’t to drink pernod if you’re sick.”“You neither.”“It doesn’t make any difference with me."
5046,3,It doesn’t make any differencewith a woman.”“What are you called?”“Georgette.
5047,3,"How are you called?”“Jacob.”“That’s a Flemish name.”“American too.”“You’re not Flamand?”“No, American.”“Good, I detest Flamands.”By this time we were at the restaurant."
5048,3,I called to the _cocher_ tostop.
5049,3,"We got out and Georgette did not like the looks of the place.“This is no great thing of a restaurant.”“No,” I said."
5050,3,“Maybe you would rather go to Foyot’s.
5051,3,Why don’t you keepthe cab and go on?”I had picked her up because of a vague sentimental idea that it would benice to eat with some one.
5052,3,"It was a long time since I had dined with a_poule_, and I had forgotten how dull it could be."
5053,3,"We went into therestaurant, passed Madame Lavigne at the desk and into a little room.Georgette cheered up a little under the food.“It isn’t bad here,” she said."
5054,3,"“It isn’t chic, but the food is allright.”“Better than you eat in Liège.”“Brussels, you mean.”We had another bottle of wine and Georgette made a joke."
5055,3,"She smiled andshowed all her bad teeth, and we touched glasses."
5056,3,"“You’re not a badtype,” she said."
5057,3,“It’s a shame you’re sick.
5058,3,We get on well.
5059,3,"What’s thematter with you, anyway?”“I got hurt in the war,” I said.“Oh, that dirty war.”We would probably have gone on and discussed the war and agreed that itwas in reality a calamity for civilization, and perhaps would have beenbetter avoided."
5060,3,I was bored enough.
5061,3,"Just then from the other room someone called: “Barnes! I say, Barnes! Jacob Barnes!”“It’s a friend calling me,” I explained, and went out.There was Braddocks at a big table with a party: Cohn, Frances Clyne,Mrs."
5062,3,"Braddocks, several people I did not know.“You’re coming to the dance, aren’t you?” Braddocks asked.“What dance?”“Why, the dancings."
5063,3,Don’t you know we’ve revived them?” Mrs.
5064,3,"Braddocksput in.“You must come, Jake."
5065,3,"We’re all going,” Frances said from the end of thetable."
5066,3,"She was tall and had a smile.“Of course, he’s coming,” Braddocks said."
5067,3,"“Come in and have coffee withus, Barnes.”“Right.”“And bring your friend,” said Mrs."
5068,3,Braddocks laughing.
5069,3,"She was aCanadian and had all their easy social graces.“Thanks, we’ll be in,” I said."
5070,3,I went back to the small room.“Who are your friends?” Georgette asked.“Writers and artists.”“There are lots of those on this side of the river.”“Too many.”“I think so.
5071,3,"Still, some of them make money.”“Oh, yes.”We finished the meal and the wine."
5072,3,"“Come on,” I said."
5073,3,"“We’re going tohave coffee with the others.”Georgette opened her bag, made a few passes at her face as she looked inthe little mirror, re-defined her lips with the lipstick, andstraightened her hat.“Good,” she said.We went into the room full of people and Braddocks and the men at histable stood up.“I wish to present my fiancée, Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc,” I said.Georgette smiled that wonderful smile, and we shook hands all round.“Are you related to Georgette Leblanc, the singer?” Mrs."
5074,3,"Braddocksasked.“Connais pas,” Georgette answered.“But you have the same name,” Mrs."
5075,3,"Braddocks insisted cordially.“No,” said Georgette."
5076,3,“Not at all.
5077,3,My name is Hobin.”“But Mr.
5078,3,Barnes introduced you as Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc.
5079,3,"Surelyhe did,” insisted Mrs."
5080,3,"Braddocks, who in the excitement of talkingFrench was liable to have no idea what she was saying.“He’s a fool,” Georgette said.“Oh, it was a joke, then,” Mrs."
5081,3,"Braddocks said.“Yes,” said Georgette."
5082,3,"“To laugh at.”“Did you hear that, Henry?” Mrs."
5083,3,Braddocks called down the table toBraddocks.
5084,3,“Mr.
5085,3,"Barnes introduced his fiancée as Mademoiselle Leblanc,and her name is actually Hobin.”“Of course, darling."
5086,3,"Mademoiselle Hobin, I’ve known her for a very longtime.”“Oh, Mademoiselle Hobin,” Frances Clyne called, speaking French veryrapidly and not seeming so proud and astonished as Mrs."
5087,3,Braddocks at itscoming out really French.
5088,3,"“Have you been in Paris long? Do you like ithere? You love Paris, do you not?”“Who’s she?” Georgette turned to me."
5089,3,"“Do I have to talk to her?”She turned to Frances, sitting smiling, her hands folded, her headpoised on her long neck, her lips pursed ready to start talking again.“No, I don’t like Paris."
5090,3,It’s expensive and dirty.”“Really? I find it so extraordinarily clean.
5091,3,One of the cleanest citiesin all Europe.”“I find it dirty.”“How strange! But perhaps you have not been here very long.”“I’ve been here long enough.”“But it does have nice people in it.
5092,3,One must grant that.”Georgette turned to me.
5093,3,"“You have nice friends.”Frances was a little drunk and would have liked to have kept it up butthe coffee came, and Lavigne with the liqueurs, and after that we allwent out and started for Braddocks’s dancing-club.The dancing-club was a _bal musette_ in the Rue de la Montagne SainteGeneviève."
5094,3,Five nights a week the working people of the Pantheon quarterdanced there.
5095,3,One night a week it was the dancing-club.
5096,3,On Monday nightsit was closed.
5097,3,"When we arrived it was quite empty, except for apoliceman sitting near the door, the wife of the proprietor back of thezinc bar, and the proprietor himself."
5098,3,The daughter of the house camedownstairs as we went in.
5099,3,"There were long benches, and tables ran acrossthe room, and at the far end a dancing-floor.“I wish people would come earlier,” Braddocks said."
5100,3,The daughter came upand wanted to know what we would drink.
5101,3,The proprietor got up on a highstool beside the dancing-floor and began to play the accordion.
5102,3,He had astring of bells around one of his ankles and beat time with his foot ashe played.
5103,3,Every one danced.
5104,3,"It was hot and we came off the floorperspiring.“My God,” Georgette said."
5105,3,"“What a box to sweat in!”“It’s hot.”“Hot, my God!”“Take off your hat.”“That’s a good idea.”Some one asked Georgette to dance, and I went over to the bar."
5106,3,It wasreally very hot and the accordion music was pleasant in the hot night.
5107,3,"Idrank a beer, standing in the doorway and getting the cool breath ofwind from the street."
5108,3,Two taxis were coming down the steep street.
5109,3,Theyboth stopped in front of the Bal.
5110,3,"A crowd of young men, some in jerseysand some in their shirt-sleeves, got out."
5111,3,"I could see their hands andnewly washed, wavy hair in the light from the door."
5112,3,The policemanstanding by the door looked at me and smiled.
5113,3,They came in.
5114,3,"As they wentin, under the light I saw white hands, wavy hair, white faces,grimacing, gesturing, talking."
5115,3,With them was Brett.
5116,3,She looked verylovely and she was very much with them.One of them saw Georgette and said: “I do declare.
5117,3,There is an actualharlot.
5118,3,"I’m going to dance with her, Lett."
5119,3,"You watch me.”The tall dark one, called Lett, said: “Don’t you be rash.”The wavy blond one answered: “Don’t you worry, dear.” And with them wasBrett.I was very angry."
5120,3,Somehow they always made me angry.
5121,3,"I know they aresupposed to be amusing, and you should be tolerant, but I wanted toswing on one, any one, anything to shatter that superior, simperingcomposure."
5122,3,"Instead, I walked down the street and had a beer at the barat the next Bal."
5123,3,The beer was not good and I had a worse cognac to takethe taste out of my mouth.
5124,3,"When I came back to the Bal there was a crowdon the floor and Georgette was dancing with the tall blond youth, whodanced big-hippily, carrying his head on one side, his eyes lifted as hedanced."
5125,3,As soon as the music stopped another one of them asked her todance.
5126,3,She had been taken up by them.
5127,3,I knew then that they would alldance with her.
5128,3,They are like that.I sat down at a table.
5129,3,Cohn was sitting there.
5130,3,Frances was dancing.
5131,3,Mrs.Braddocks brought up somebody and introduced him as Robert Prentiss.
5132,3,"Hewas from New York by way of Chicago, and was a rising new novelist."
5133,3,Hehad some sort of an English accent.
5134,3,"I asked him to have a drink.“Thanks so much,” he said, “I’ve just had one.”“Have another.”“Thanks, I will then.”We got the daughter of the house over and each had a _fine à l’eau_.“You’re from Kansas City, they tell me,” he said.“Yes.”“Do you find Paris amusing?”“Yes.”“Really?”I was a little drunk."
5135,3,"Not drunk in any positive sense but just enough tobe careless.“For God’s sake,” I said, “yes."
5136,3,"Don’t you?”“Oh, how charmingly you get angry,” he said."
5137,3,“I wish I had thatfaculty.”I got up and walked over toward the dancing-floor.
5138,3,Mrs.
5139,3,Braddocksfollowed me.
5140,3,"“Don’t be cross with Robert,” she said."
5141,3,"“He’s still only achild, you know.”“I wasn’t cross,” I said."
5142,3,"“I just thought perhaps I was going to throwup.”“Your fiancée is having a great success,” Mrs."
5143,3,"Braddocks looked out onthe floor where Georgette was dancing in the arms of the tall, dark one,called Lett.“Isn’t she?” I said.“Rather,” said Mrs."
5144,3,Braddocks.Cohn came up.
5145,3,"“Come on, Jake,” he said, “have a drink.” We walked overto the bar."
5146,3,“What’s the matter with you? You seem all worked up oversomething?”“Nothing.
5147,3,"This whole show makes me sick is all.”Brett came up to the bar.“Hello, you chaps.”“Hello, Brett,” I said."
5148,3,“Why aren’t you tight?”“Never going to get tight any more.
5149,3,"I say, give a chap a brandy andsoda.”She stood holding the glass and I saw Robert Cohn looking at her."
5150,3,Helooked a great deal as his compatriot must have looked when he saw thepromised land.
5151,3,"Cohn, of course, was much younger."
5152,3,"But he had that lookof eager, deserving expectation.Brett was damned good-looking."
5153,3,"She wore a slipover jersey sweater and atweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy’s."
5154,3,She started allthat.
5155,3,"She was built with curves like the hull of a racing yacht, and youmissed none of it with that wool jersey.“It’s a fine crowd you’re with, Brett,” I said.“Aren’t they lovely? And you, my dear."
5156,3,"Where did you get it?”“At the Napolitain.”“And have you had a lovely evening?”“Oh, priceless,” I said.Brett laughed."
5157,3,"“It’s wrong of you, Jake."
5158,3,"It’s an insult to all of us.Look at Frances there, and Jo.”This for Cohn’s benefit.“It’s in restraint of trade,” Brett said."
5159,3,"She laughed again.“You’re wonderfully sober,” I said.“Yes."
5160,3,"Aren’t I? And when one’s with the crowd I’m with, one can drink insuch safety, too.”The music started and Robert Cohn said: “Will you dance this with me,Lady Brett?”Brett smiled at him."
5161,3,"“I’ve promised to dance this with Jacob,” shelaughed."
5162,3,"“You’ve a hell of a biblical name, Jake.”“How about the next?” asked Cohn.“We’re going,” Brett said."
5163,3,"“We’ve a date up at Montmartre.” Dancing, Ilooked over Brett’s shoulder and saw Cohn, standing at the bar, stillwatching her.“You’ve made a new one there,” I said to her.“Don’t talk about it."
5164,3,Poor chap.
5165,3,"I never knew it till just now.”“Oh, well,” I said."
5166,3,"“I suppose you like to add them up.”“Don’t talk like a fool.”“You do.”“Oh, well."
5167,3,"What if I do?”“Nothing,” I said."
5168,3,We were dancing to the accordion and some one wasplaying the banjo.
5169,3,It was hot and I felt happy.
5170,3,"We passed close toGeorgette dancing with another one of them.“What possessed you to bring her?”“I don’t know, I just brought her.”“You’re getting damned romantic.”“No, bored.”“Now?”“No, not now.”“Let’s get out of here."
5171,3,She’s well taken care of.”“Do you want to?”“Would I ask you if I didn’t want to?”We left the floor and I took my coat off a hanger on the wall and put iton.
5172,3,Brett stood by the bar.
5173,3,Cohn was talking to her.
5174,3,I stopped at thebar and asked them for an envelope.
5175,3,The patronne found one.
5176,3,"I took afifty-franc note from my pocket, put it in the envelope, sealed it, andhanded it to the patronne.“If the girl I came with asks for me, will you give her this?” I said.“If she goes out with one of those gentlemen, will you save this forme?”“C’est entendu, Monsieur,” the patronne said."
5177,3,"“You go now? So early?”“Yes,” I said.We started out the door."
5178,3,Cohn was still talking to Brett.
5179,3,She said goodnight and took my arm.
5180,3,"“Good night, Cohn,” I said."
5181,3,"Outside in the streetwe looked for a taxi.“You’re going to lose your fifty francs,” Brett said.“Oh, yes.”“No taxis.”“We could walk up to the Pantheon and get one.”“Come on and we’ll get a drink in the pub next door and send for one.”“You wouldn’t walk across the street.”“Not if I could help it.”We went into the next bar and I sent a waiter for a taxi.“Well,” I said, “we’re out away from them.”We stood against the tall zinc bar and did not talk and looked at eachother."
5182,3,The waiter came and said the taxi was outside.
5183,3,Brett pressed myhand hard.
5184,3,I gave the waiter a franc and we went out.
5185,3,"“Where should Itell him?” I asked.“Oh, tell him to drive around.”I told the driver to go to the Parc Montsouris, and got in, and slammedthe door."
5186,3,"Brett was leaning back in the corner, her eyes closed."
5187,3,I gotin and sat beside her.
5188,3,"The cab started with a jerk.“Oh, darling, I’ve been so miserable,” Brett said."
5189,3,"                               CHAPTER                                   4The taxi went up the hill, passed the lighted square, then on into thedark, still climbing, then levelled out onto a dark street behind St.Etienne du Mont, went smoothly down the asphalt, passed the trees andthe standing bus at the Place de la Contrescarpe, then turned onto thecobbles of the Rue Mouffetard."
5190,3,There were lighted bars and late openshops on each side of the street.
5191,3,We were sitting apart and we joltedclose together going down the old street.
5192,3,Brett’s hat was off.
5193,3,Her headwas back.
5194,3,"I saw her face in the lights from the open shops, then it wasdark, then I saw her face clearly as we came out on the Avenue desGobelins."
5195,3,The street was torn up and men were working on the car-tracksby the light of acetylene flares.
5196,3,Brett’s face was white and the longline of her neck showed in the bright light of the flares.
5197,3,The streetwas dark again and I kissed her.
5198,3,"Our lips were tight together and thenshe turned away and pressed against the corner of the seat, as far awayas she could get."
5199,3,"Her head was down.“Don’t touch me,” she said."
5200,3,"“Please don’t touch me.”“What’s the matter?”“I can’t stand it.”“Oh, Brett.”“You mustn’t."
5201,3,You must know.
5202,3,"I can’t stand it, that’s all."
5203,3,"Oh, darling,please understand!”“Don’t you love me?”“Love you? I simply turn all to jelly when you touch me.”“Isn’t there anything we can do about it?”She was sitting up now."
5204,3,"My arm was around her and she was leaning backagainst me, and we were quite calm."
5205,3,She was looking into my eyes withthat way she had of looking that made you wonder whether she really sawout of her own eyes.
5206,3,They would look on and on after every one else’seyes in the world would have stopped looking.
5207,3,"She looked as though therewere nothing on earth she would not look at like that, and really shewas afraid of so many things.“And there’s not a damn thing we could do,” I said.“I don’t know,” she said."
5208,3,"“I don’t want to go through that hell again.”“We’d better keep away from each other.”“But, darling, I have to see you."
5209,3,"It isn’t all that you know.”“No, but it always gets to be.”“That’s my fault."
5210,3,"Don’t we pay for all the things we do, though?”She had been looking into my eyes all the time."
5211,3,"Her eyes had differentdepths, sometimes they seemed perfectly flat."
5212,3,Now you could see all theway into them.“When I think of the hell I’ve put chaps through.
5213,3,"I’m paying for it allnow.”“Don’t talk like a fool,” I said."
5214,3,"“Besides, what happened to me issupposed to be funny."
5215,3,"I never think about it.”“Oh, no."
5216,3,"I’ll lay you don’t.”“Well, let’s shut up about it.”“I laughed about it too, myself, once.” She wasn’t looking at me."
5217,3,“Afriend of my brother’s came home that way from Mons.
5218,3,It seemed like ahell of a joke.
5219,3,"Chaps never know anything, do they?”“No,” I said."
5220,3,“Nobody ever knows anything.”I was pretty well through with the subject.
5221,3,"At one time or another I hadprobably considered it from most of its various angles, including theone that certain injuries or imperfections are a subject of merrimentwhile remaining quite serious for the person possessing them.“It’s funny,” I said."
5222,3,“It’s very funny.
5223,3,"And it’s a lot of fun, too, tobe in love.”“Do you think so?” her eyes looked flat again.“I don’t mean fun that way."
5224,3,"In a way it’s an enjoyable feeling.”“No,” she said."
5225,3,“I think it’s hell on earth.”“It’s good to see each other.”“No.
5226,3,I don’t think it is.”“Don’t you want to?”“I have to.”We were sitting now like two strangers.
5227,3,On the right was the ParcMontsouris.
5228,3,The restaurant where they have the pool of live trout andwhere you can sit and look out over the park was closed and dark.
5229,3,Thedriver leaned his head around.“Where do you want to go?” I asked.
5230,3,"Brett turned her head away.“Oh, go to the Select.”“Café Select,” I told the driver."
5231,3,"“Boulevard Montparnasse.” We drovestraight down, turning around the Lion de Belfort that guards thepassing Montrouge trams."
5232,3,Brett looked straight ahead.
5233,3,"On the BoulevardRaspail, with the lights of Montparnasse in sight, Brett said: “Wouldyou mind very much if I asked you to do something?”“Don’t be silly.”“Kiss me just once more before we get there.”When the taxi stopped I got out and paid."
5234,3,Brett came out putting on herhat.
5235,3,She gave me her hand as she stepped down.
5236,3,Her hand was shaky.
5237,3,"“Isay, do I look too much of a mess?” She pulled her man’s felt hat downand started in for the bar."
5238,3,"Inside, against the bar and at tables, weremost of the crowd who a been at the dance.“Hello, you chaps,” Brett said."
5239,3,"“I’m going to have a drink.”“Oh, Brett! Brett!” the little Greek portrait-painter, who calledhimself a duke, and whom everybody called Zizi, pushed up to her."
5240,3,"“I gotsomething fine to tell you.”“Hello, Zizi,” Brett said.“I want you to meet a friend,” Zizi said."
5241,3,"A fat man came up.“Count Mippipopolous, meet my friend Lady Ashley.”“How do you do?” said Brett.“Well, does your Ladyship have a good time here in Paris?” asked CountMippipopolous, who wore an elk’s tooth on his watch-chain.“Rather,” said Brett.“Paris is a fine town all right,” said the count."
5242,3,"“But I guess you havepretty big doings yourself over in London.”“Oh, yes,” said Brett."
5243,3,“Enormous.”Braddocks called to me from a table.
5244,3,"“Barnes,” he said, “have a drink.That girl of yours got in a frightful row.”“What about?”“Something the patronne’s daughter said."
5245,3,A corking row.
5246,3,"She was rathersplendid, you know."
5247,3,Showed her yellow card and demanded the patronne’sdaughter’s too.
5248,3,"I say it was a row.”“What finally happened?”“Oh, some one took her home."
5249,3,Not a bad-looking girl.
5250,3,Wonderful commandof the idiom.
5251,3,"Do stay and have a drink.”“No,” I said."
5252,3,“I must shove off.
5253,3,"Seen Cohn?”“He went home with Frances,” Mrs."
5254,3,"Braddock put in.“Poor chap, he looks awfully down,” Braddocks said.“I dare say he is,” said Mrs."
5255,3,"Braddocks.“I have to shove off,” I said."
5256,3,“Good night.”I said good night to Brett at the bar.
5257,3,"The count was buying champagne.“Will you take a glass of wine with us, sir?” he asked.“No."
5258,3,Thanks awfully.
5259,3,"I have to go.”“Really going?” Brett asked.“Yes,” I said."
5260,3,"“I’ve got a rotten headache.”“I’ll see you to-morrow?”“Come in at the office.”“Hardly.”“Well, where will I see you?”“Anywhere around five o’clock.”“Make it the other side of town then.”“Good."
5261,3,"I’ll be at the Crillon at five.”“Try and be there,” I said.“Don’t worry,” Brett said."
5262,3,"“I’ve never let you down, have I?”“Heard from Mike?”“Letter to-day.”“Good night, sir,” said the count.I went out onto the sidewalk and walked down toward the Boulevard St.Michel, passed the tables of the Rotonde, still crowded, looked acrossthe street at the Dome, its tables running out to the edge of thepavement."
5263,3,"Some one waved at me from a table, I did not see who it wasand went on."
5264,3,I wanted to get home.
5265,3,The Boulevard Montparnasse wasdeserted.
5266,3,"Lavigne’s was closed tight, and they were stacking the tablesoutside the Closerie des Lilas."
5267,3,I passed Ney’s statue standing among thenew-leaved chestnut-trees in the arc-light.
5268,3,There was a faded purplewreath leaning against the base.
5269,3,"I stopped and read the inscription:from the Bonapartist Groups, some date; I forget."
5270,3,"He looked very fine,Marshal Ney in his top-boots, gesturing with his sword among the greennew horse-chestnut leaves."
5271,3,"My flat was just across the street, a littleway down the Boulevard St."
5272,3,Michel.There was a light in the concierge’s room and I knocked on the door andshe gave me my mail.
5273,3,I wished her good night and went up-stairs.
5274,3,Therewere two letters and some papers.
5275,3,I looked at them under the gas-lightin the dining-room.
5276,3,The letters were from the States.
5277,3,One was a bankstatement.
5278,3,It showed a balance of $2432.60.
5279,3,"I got out my check-book anddeducted four checks drawn since the first of the month, and discoveredI had a balance of $1832.60."
5280,3,I wrote this on the back of the statement.The other letter was a wedding announcement.
5281,3,Mr.
5282,3,and Mrs.
5283,3,Aloysius Kirbyannounce the marriage of their daughter Katherine—I knew neither thegirl nor the man she was marrying.
5284,3,They must be circularizing the town.It was a funny name.
5285,3,I felt sure I could remember anybody with a namelike Aloysius.
5286,3,It was a good Catholic name.
5287,3,There was a crest on theannouncement.
5288,3,Like Zizi the Greek duke.
5289,3,And that count.
5290,3,The count wasfunny.
5291,3,"Brett had a title, too."
5292,3,Lady Ashley.
5293,3,To hell with Brett.
5294,3,"To hellwith you, Lady Ashley.I lit the lamp beside the bed, turned off the gas, and opened the widewindows."
5295,3,"The bed was far back from the windows, and I sat with thewindows open and undressed by the bed."
5296,3,"Outside a night train, running onthe street-car tracks, went by carrying vegetables to the markets."
5297,3,Theywere noisy at night when you could not sleep.
5298,3,"Undressing, I looked atmyself in the mirror of the big armoire beside the bed."
5299,3,That was atypically French way to furnish a room.
5300,3,"Practical, too, I suppose."
5301,3,Ofall the ways to be wounded.
5302,3,I suppose it was funny.
5303,3,I put on my pajamasand got into bed.
5304,3,"I had the two bull-fight papers, and I took theirwrappers off."
5305,3,One was orange.
5306,3,The other yellow.
5307,3,"They would both have thesame news, so whichever I read first would spoil the other."
5308,3,"_Le Toril_was the better paper, so I started to read it."
5309,3,"I read it all the waythrough, including the Petite Correspondance and the Cornigrams."
5310,3,I blewout the lamp.
5311,3,Perhaps I would be able to sleep.My head started to work.
5312,3,The old grievance.
5313,3,"Well, it was a rotten way tobe wounded and flying on a joke front like the Italian."
5314,3,In the Italianhospital we were going to form a society.
5315,3,It had a funny name inItalian.
5316,3,"I wonder what became of the others, the Italians."
5317,3,"That was inthe Ospedale Maggiore in Milano, Padiglione Ponte."
5318,3,The next building wasthe Padiglione Zonda.
5319,3,"There was a statue of Ponte, or maybe it wasZonda."
5320,3,That was where the liaison colonel came to visit me.
5321,3,That wasfunny.
5322,3,That was about the first funny thing.
5323,3,I was all bandaged up.
5324,3,Butthey had told him about it.
5325,3,"Then he made that wonderful speech: “You, aforeigner, an Englishman” (any foreigner was an Englishman) “have givenmore than your life.” What a speech! I would like to have it illuminatedto hang in the office."
5326,3,He never laughed.
5327,3,"He was putting himself in myplace, I guess."
5328,3,"“Che mala fortuna! Che mala fortuna!”I never used to realize it, I guess."
5329,3,I try and play it along and justnot make trouble for people.
5330,3,Probably I never would have had any troubleif I hadn’t run into Brett when they shipped me to England.
5331,3,I supposeshe only wanted what she couldn’t have.
5332,3,"Well, people were that way."
5333,3,Tohell with people.
5334,3,The Catholic Church had an awfully good way ofhandling all that.
5335,3,"Good advice, anyway."
5336,3,Not to think about it.
5337,3,"Oh, itwas swell advice."
5338,3,Try and take it sometime.
5339,3,Try and take it.I lay awake thinking and my mind jumping around.
5340,3,"Then I couldn’t keepaway from it, and I started to think about Brett and all the rest of itwent away."
5341,3,I was thinking about Brett and my mind stopped jumping aroundand started to go in sort of smooth waves.
5342,3,Then all of a sudden Istarted to cry.
5343,3,"Then after a while it was better and I lay in bed andlistened to the heavy trams go by and way down the street, and then Iwent to sleep.I woke up."
5344,3,There was a row going on outside.
5345,3,I listened and I thought Irecognized a voice.
5346,3,I put on a dressing-gown and went to the door.
5347,3,Theconcierge was talking down-stairs.
5348,3,She was very angry.
5349,3,"I heard my nameand called down the stairs.“Is that you, Monsieur Barnes?” the concierge called.“Yes."
5350,3,It’s me.”“There’s a species of woman here who’s waked the whole street up.
5351,3,Whatkind of a dirty business at this time of night! She says she must seeyou.
5352,3,I’ve told her you’re asleep.”Then I heard Brett’s voice.
5353,3,Half asleep I had been sure it wasGeorgette.
5354,3,I don’t know why.
5355,3,"She could not have known my address.“Will you send her up, please?”Brett came up the stairs."
5356,3,I saw she was quite drunk.
5357,3,"“Silly thing todo,” she said."
5358,3,“Make an awful row.
5359,3,"I say, you weren’t asleep, were you?”“What did you think I was doing?”“Don’t know."
5360,3,What time is it?”I looked at the clock.
5361,3,It was half-past four.
5362,3,"“Had no idea what hour itwas,” Brett said."
5363,3,"“I say, can a chap sit down? Don’t be cross, darling.Just left the count."
5364,3,"He brought me here.”“What’s he like?” I was getting brandy and soda and glasses.“Just a little,” said Brett."
5365,3,“Don’t try and make me drunk.
5366,3,"The count?Oh, rather."
5367,3,He’s quite one of us.”“Is he a count?”“Here’s how.
5368,3,"I rather think so, you know."
5369,3,"Deserves to be, anyhow."
5370,3,Knowshell’s own amount about people.
5371,3,Don’t know where he got it all.
5372,3,Owns achain of sweetshops in the States.”She sipped at her glass.“Think he called it a chain.
5373,3,Something like that.
5374,3,Linked them all up.Told me a little about it.
5375,3,Damned interesting.
5376,3,"He’s one of us, though.Oh, quite."
5377,3,No doubt.
5378,3,"One can always tell.”She took another drink.“How do I buck on about all this? You don’t mind, do you? He’s puttingup for Zizi, you know.”“Is Zizi really a duke, too?”“I shouldn’t wonder."
5379,3,"Greek, you know."
5380,3,Rotten painter.
5381,3,"I rather liked thecount.”“Where did you go with him?”“Oh, everywhere."
5382,3,He just brought me here now.
5383,3,Offered me ten thousanddollars to go to Biarritz with him.
5384,3,How much is that in pounds?”“Around two thousand.”“Lot of money.
5385,3,I told him I couldn’t do it.
5386,3,He was awfully nice aboutit.
5387,3,"Told him I knew too many people in Biarritz.”Brett laughed.“I say, you are slow on the up-take,” she said."
5388,3,I had only sipped mybrandy and soda.
5389,3,I took a long drink.“That’s better.
5390,3,"Very funny,” Brett said."
5391,3,“Then he wanted me to go toCannes with him.
5392,3,Told him I knew too many people in Cannes.
5393,3,Monte Carlo.Told him I knew too many people in Monte Carlo.
5394,3,Told him I knew too manypeople everywhere.
5395,3,"Quite true, too."
5396,3,"So I asked him to bring me here.”She looked at me, her hand on the table, her glass raised."
5397,3,"“Don’t looklike that,” she said."
5398,3,“Told him I was in love with you.
5399,3,"True, too."
5400,3,Don’tlook like that.
5401,3,He was damn nice about it.
5402,3,Wants to drive us out todinner to-morrow night.
5403,3,Like to go?”“Why not?”“I’d better go now.”“Why?”“Just wanted to see you.
5404,3,Damned silly idea.
5405,3,Want to get dressed and comedown? He’s got the car just up the street.”“The count?”“Himself.
5406,3,And a chauffeur in livery.
5407,3,Going to drive me around and havebreakfast in the Bois.
5408,3,Hampers.
5409,3,Got it all at Zelli’s.
5410,3,Dozen bottles ofMumms.
5411,3,"Tempt you?”“I have to work in the morning,” I said."
5412,3,“I’m too far behind you now tocatch up and be any fun.”“Don’t be an ass.”“Can’t do it.”“Right.
5413,3,Send him a tender message?”“Anything.
5414,3,"Absolutely.”“Good night, darling.”“Don’t be sentimental.”“You make me ill.”We kissed good night and Brett shivered."
5415,3,"“I’d better go,” she said.“Good night, darling.”“You don’t have to go.”“Yes.”We kissed again on the stairs and as I called for the cordon theconcierge muttered something behind her door."
5416,3,I went back up-stairs andfrom the open window watched Brett walking up the street to the biglimousine drawn up to the curb under the arc-light.
5417,3,She got in and itstarted off.
5418,3,I turned around.
5419,3,On the table was an empty glass and aglass half-full of brandy and soda.
5420,3,I took them both out to the kitchenand poured the half-full glass down the sink.
5421,3,"I turned off the gas inthe dining-room, kicked off my slippers sitting on the bed, and got intobed."
5422,3,"This was Brett, that I had felt like crying about."
5423,3,"Then I thoughtof her walking up the street and stepping into the car, as I had lastseen her, and of course in a little while I felt like hell again."
5424,3,"It isawfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the daytime, but atnight it is another thing."
5425,3,                               CHAPTER                                   5In the morning I walked down the Boulevard to the rue Soufflot forcoffee and brioche.
5426,3,It was a fine morning.
5427,3,The horse-chestnut trees inthe Luxembourg gardens were in bloom.
5428,3,There was the pleasantearly-morning feeling of a hot day.
5429,3,I read the papers with the coffeeand then smoked a cigarette.
5430,3,The flower-women were coming up from themarket and arranging their daily stock.
5431,3,"Students went by going up to thelaw school, or down to the Sorbonne."
5432,3,The Boulevard was busy with tramsand people going to work.
5433,3,"I got on an S bus and rode down to theMadeleine, standing on the back platform."
5434,3,"From the Madeleine I walkedalong the Boulevard des Capucines to the Opéra, and up to my office."
5435,3,Ipassed the man with the jumping frogs and the man with the boxer toys.
5436,3,Istepped aside to avoid walking into the thread with which his girlassistant manipulated the boxers.
5437,3,"She was standing looking away, thethread in her folded hands."
5438,3,The man was urging two tourists to buy.Three more tourists had stopped and were watching.
5439,3,I walked on behind aman who was pushing a roller that printed the name CINZANO on thesidewalk in damp letters.
5440,3,All along people were going to work.
5441,3,It feltpleasant to be going to work.
5442,3,"I walked across the avenue and turned into my office.Up-stairs in the office I read the French morning papers, smoked, andthen sat at the typewriter and got off a good morning’s work."
5443,3,"At eleveno’clock I went over to the Quai d’Orsay in a taxi and went in and satwith about a dozen correspondents, while the foreign-office mouthpiece,a young Nouvelle Revue Française diplomat in horn-rimmed spectacles,talked and answered questions for half an hour."
5444,3,"The President of theCouncil was in Lyons making a speech, or, rather he was on his way back.Several people asked questions to hear themselves talk and there were acouple of questions asked by news service men who wanted to know theanswers."
5445,3,There was no news.
5446,3,"I shared a taxi back from the Quai d’Orsaywith Woolsey and Krum.“What do you do nights, Jake?” asked Krum."
5447,3,"“I never see you around.”“Oh, I’m over in the Quarter.”“I’m coming over some night."
5448,3,The Dingo.
5449,3,"That’s the great place, isn’tit?”“Yes."
5450,3,"That, or this new dive, The Select.”“I’ve meant to get over,” said Krum."
5451,3,"“You know how it is, though, with awife and kids.”“Playing any tennis?” Woolsey asked.“Well, no,” said Krum."
5452,3,“I can’t say I’ve played any this year.
5453,3,"I’vetried to get away, but Sundays it’s always rained, and the courts are sodamned crowded.”“The Englishmen all have Saturday off,” Woolsey said.“Lucky beggars,” said Krum."
5454,3,"“Well, I’ll tell you."
5455,3,Some day I’m not goingto be working for an agency.
5456,3,Then I’ll have plenty of time to get out inthe country.”“That’s the thing to do.
5457,3,Live out in the country and have a little car.”“I’ve been thinking some about getting a car next year.”I banged on the glass.
5458,3,The chauffeur stopped.
5459,3,"“Here’s my street,” Isaid."
5460,3,"“Come in and have a drink.”“Thanks, old man,” Krum said."
5461,3,Woolsey shook his head.
5462,3,"“I’ve got to filethat line he got off this morning.”I put a two-franc piece in Krum’s hand.“You’re crazy, Jake,” he said."
5463,3,"“This is on me.”“It’s all on the office, anyway.”“Nope."
5464,3,I want to get it.”I waved good-by.
5465,3,Krum put his head out.
5466,3,“See you at the lunch onWednesday.”“You bet.”I went to the office in the elevator.
5467,3,"Robert Cohn was waiting for me.“Hello, Jake,” he said."
5468,3,“Going out to lunch?”“Yes.
5469,3,Let me see if there is anything new.”“Where will we eat?”“Anywhere.”I was looking over my desk.
5470,3,“Where do you want to eat?”“How about Wetzel’s? They’ve got good hors d’œuvres.”In the restaurant we ordered hors d’œuvres and beer.
5471,3,"The sommelierbrought the beer, tall, beaded on the outside of the steins, and cold.There were a dozen different dishes of hors d’œuvres.“Have any fun last night?” I asked.“No."
5472,3,I don’t think so.”“How’s the writing going?”“Rotten.
5473,3,"I can’t get this second book going.”“That happens to everybody.”“Oh, I’m sure of that."
5474,3,"It gets me worried, though.”“Thought any more about going to South America?”“I mean that.”“Well, why don’t you start off?”“Frances.”“Well,” I said, “take her with you.”“She wouldn’t like it."
5475,3,That isn’t the sort of thing she likes.
5476,3,She likesa lot of people around.”“Tell her to go to hell.”“I can’t.
5477,3,"I’ve got certain obligations to her.”He shoved the sliced cucumbers away and took a pickled herring.“What do you know about Lady Brett Ashley, Jake?”“Her name’s Lady Ashley."
5478,3,Brett’s her own name.
5479,3,"She’s a nice girl,” Isaid."
5480,3,“She’s getting a divorce and she’s going to marry Mike Campbell.He’s over in Scotland now.
5481,3,"Why?”“She’s a remarkably attractive woman.”“Isn’t she?”“There’s a certain quality about her, a certain fineness."
5482,3,"She seems tobe absolutely fine and straight.”“She’s very nice.”“I don’t know how to describe the quality,” Cohn said."
5483,3,“I suppose it’sbreeding.”“You sound as though you liked her pretty well.”“I do.
5484,3,"I shouldn’t wonder if I were in love with her.”“She’s a drunk,” I said."
5485,3,"“She’s in love with Mike Campbell, and she’sgoing to marry him."
5486,3,He’s going to be rich as hell some day.”“I don’t believe she’ll ever marry him.”“Why not?”“I don’t know.
5487,3,I just don’t believe it.
5488,3,"Have you known her a long time?”“Yes,” I said."
5489,3,“She was a V.
5490,3,A.
5491,3,D.
5492,3,in a hospital I was in during thewar.”“She must have been just a kid then.”“She’s thirty-four now.”“When did she marry Ashley?”“During the war.
5493,3,Her own true love had just kicked off with thedysentery.”“You talk sort of bitter.”“Sorry.
5494,3,I didn’t mean to.
5495,3,"I was just trying to give you the facts.”“I don’t believe she would marry anybody she didn’t love.”“Well,” I said."
5496,3,"“She’s done it twice.”“I don’t believe it.”“Well,” I said, “don’t ask me a lot of fool questions if you don’t likethe answers.”“I didn’t ask you that.”“You asked me what I knew about Brett Ashley.”“I didn’t ask you to insult her.”“Oh, go to hell.”He stood up from the table his face white, and stood there white andangry behind the little plates of hors d’œuvres.“Sit down,” I said."
5497,3,"“Don’t be a fool.”“You’ve got to take that back.”“Oh, cut out the prep-school stuff.”“Take it back.”“Sure."
5498,3,Anything.
5499,3,I never heard of Brett Ashley.
5500,3,How’s that?“No.
5501,3,Not that.
5502,3,"About me going to hell.”“Oh, don’t go to hell,” I said."
5503,3,“Stick around.
5504,3,We’re just startinglunch.”Cohn smiled again and sat down.
5505,3,He seemed glad to sit down.
5506,3,"What thehell would he have done if he hadn’t sat down? “You say such damnedinsulting things, Jake.”“I’m sorry."
5507,3,I’ve got a nasty tongue.
5508,3,"I never mean it when I say nastythings.”“I know it,” Cohn said."
5509,3,"“You’re really about the best friend I have,Jake.”God help you, I thought."
5510,3,"“Forget what I said,” I said out loud."
5511,3,“I’msorry.”“It’s all right.
5512,3,It’s fine.
5513,3,I was just sore for a minute.”“Good.
5514,3,Let’s get something else to eat.”After we finished the lunch we walked up to the Café de la Paix and hadcoffee.
5515,3,"I could feel Cohn wanted to bring up Brett again, but I held himoff it."
5516,3,"We talked about one thing and another, and I left him to come tothe office."
5517,3,                               CHAPTER                                   6At five o’clock I was in the Hotel Crillon waiting for Brett.
5518,3,"She wasnot there, so I sat down and wrote some letters."
5519,3,"They were not very goodletters but I hoped their being on Crillon stationery would help them.Brett did not turn up, so about quarter to six I went down to the barand had a Jack Rose with George the barman."
5520,3,"Brett had not been in thebar either, and so I looked for her up-stairs on my way out, and took ataxi to the Café Select."
5521,3,"Crossing the Seine I saw a string of bargesbeing towed empty down the current, riding high, the bargemen at thesweeps as they came toward the bridge."
5522,3,The river looked nice.
5523,3,"It wasalways pleasant crossing bridges in Paris.The taxi rounded the statue of the inventor of the semaphore engaged indoing same, and turned up the Boulevard Raspail, and I sat back to letthat part of the ride pass."
5524,3,The Boulevard Raspail always made dullriding.
5525,3,It was like a certain stretch on the P.
5526,3,L.
5527,3,M.
5528,3,betweenFontainebleau and Montereau that always made me feel bored and dead anddull until it was over.
5529,3,I suppose it is some association of ideas thatmakes those dead places in a journey.
5530,3,There are other streets in Parisas ugly as the Boulevard Raspail.
5531,3,It is a street I do not mind walkingdown at all.
5532,3,But I cannot stand to ride along it.
5533,3,Perhaps I had readsomething about it once.
5534,3,That was the way Robert Cohn was about all ofParis.
5535,3,I wondered where Cohn got that incapacity to enjoy Paris.Possibly from Mencken.
5536,3,"Mencken hates Paris, I believe."
5537,3,So many young menget their likes and dislikes from Mencken.The taxi stopped in front of the Rotonde.
5538,3,"No matter what café inMontparnasse you ask a taxi-driver to bring you to from the right bankof the river, they always take you to the Rotonde."
5539,3,Ten years from now itwill probably be the Dome.
5540,3,"It was near enough, anyway."
5541,3,I walked past thesad tables of the Rotonde to the Select.
5542,3,"There were a few people insideat the bar, and outside, alone, sat Harvey Stone."
5543,3,"He had a pile ofsaucers in front of him, and he needed a shave.“Sit down,” said Harvey, “I’ve been looking for you.”“What’s the matter?”“Nothing."
5544,3,Just looking for you.”“Been out to the races?”“No.
5545,3,Not since Sunday.”“What do you hear from the States?”“Nothing.
5546,3,Absolutely nothing.”“What’s the matter?”“I don’t know.
5547,3,I’m through with them.
5548,3,"I’m absolutely through with them.”He leaned forward and looked me in the eye.“Do you want to know something, Jake?”“Yes.”“I haven’t had anything to eat for five days.”I figured rapidly back in my mind."
5549,3,It was three days ago that Harvey hadwon two hundred francs from me shaking poker dice in the New York Bar.“What’s the matter?”“No money.
5550,3,"Money hasn’t come,” he paused."
5551,3,"“I tell you it’s strange,Jake."
5552,3,When I’m like this I just want to be alone.
5553,3,I want to stay in myown room.
5554,3,"I’m like a cat.”I felt in my pocket.“Would a hundred help you any, Harvey?”“Yes.”“Come on."
5555,3,Let’s go and eat.”“There’s no hurry.
5556,3,Have a drink.”“Better eat.”“No.
5557,3,When I get like this I don’t care whether I eat or not.”We had a drink.
5558,3,"Harvey added my saucer to his own pile.“Do you know Mencken, Harvey?”“Yes."
5559,3,Why?”“What’s he like?”“He’s all right.
5560,3,He says some pretty funny things.
5561,3,Last time I haddinner with him we talked about Hoffenheimer.
5562,3,"‘The trouble is,’ he said,‘he’s a garter snapper.’ That’s not bad.”“That’s not bad.”“He’s through now,” Harvey went on."
5563,3,"“He’s written about all the thingshe knows, and now he’s on all the things he doesn’t know.”“I guess he’s all right,” I said."
5564,3,"“I just can’t read him.”“Oh, nobody reads him now,” Harvey said, “except the people that used toread the Alexander Hamilton Institute.”“Well,” I said."
5565,3,"“That was a good thing, too.”“Sure,” said Harvey."
5566,3,"So we sat and thought deeply for a while.“Have another port?”“All right,” said Harvey.“There comes Cohn,” I said."
5567,3,"Robert Cohn was crossing the street.“That moron,” said Harvey."
5568,3,"Cohn came up to our table.“Hello, you bums,” he said.“Hello, Robert,” Harvey said."
5569,3,“I was just telling Jake here that you’rea moron.”“What do you mean?”“Tell us right off.
5570,3,Don’t think.
5571,3,What would you rather do if you coulddo anything you wanted?”Cohn started to consider.“Don’t think.
5572,3,"Bring it right out.”“I don’t know,” Cohn said."
5573,3,"“What’s it all about, anyway?”“I mean what would you rather do."
5574,3,What comes into your head first.
5575,3,"Nomatter how silly it is.”“I don’t know,” Cohn said."
5576,3,"“I think I’d rather play football again withwhat I know about handling myself, now.”“I misjudged you,” Harvey said."
5577,3,“You’re not a moron.
5578,3,"You’re only a caseof arrested development.”“You’re awfully funny, Harvey,” Cohn said."
5579,3,“Some day somebody will pushyour face in.”Harvey Stone laughed.
5580,3,“You think so.
5581,3,"They won’t, though."
5582,3,Because itwouldn’t make any difference to me.
5583,3,"I’m not a fighter.”“It would make a difference to you if anybody did it.”“No, it wouldn’t."
5584,3,That’s where you make your big mistake.
5585,3,"Because you’renot intelligent.”“Cut it out about me.”“Sure,” said Harvey."
5586,3,“It doesn’t make any difference to me.
5587,3,"You don’tmean anything to me.”“Come on, Harvey,” I said."
5588,3,"“Have another porto.”“No,” he said."
5589,3,“I’m going up the street and eat.
5590,3,"See you later, Jake.”He walked out and up the street."
5591,3,"I watched him crossing the streetthrough the taxis, small, heavy, slowly sure of himself in the traffic.“He always gets me sore,” Cohn said."
5592,3,"“I can’t stand him.”“I like him,” I said."
5593,3,“I’m fond of him.
5594,3,"You don’t want to get sore athim.”“I know it,” Cohn said."
5595,3,“He just gets on my nerves.”“Write this afternoon?”“No.
5596,3,I couldn’t get it going.
5597,3,It’s harder to do than my first book.
5598,3,I’mhaving a hard time handling it.”The sort of healthy conceit that he had when he returned from Americaearly in the spring was gone.
5599,3,"Then he had been sure of his work, onlywith these personal longings for adventure."
5600,3,Now the sureness was gone.Somehow I feel I have not shown Robert Cohn clearly.
5601,3,"The reason is thatuntil he fell in love with Brett, I never heard him make one remark thatwould, in any way, detach him from other people."
5602,3,"He was nice to watch onthe tennis-court, he had a good body, and he kept it in shape; hehandled his cards well at bridge, and he had a funny sort ofundergraduate quality about him."
5603,3,If he were in a crowd nothing he saidstood out.
5604,3,"He wore what used to be called polo shirts at school, and maybe called that still, but he was not professionally youthful."
5605,3,I do notbelieve he thought about his clothes much.
5606,3,Externally he had been formedat Princeton.
5607,3,Internally he had been moulded by the two women who hadtrained him.
5608,3,"He had a nice, boyish sort of cheerfulness that had neverbeen trained out of him, and I probably have not brought it out."
5609,3,Heloved to win at tennis.
5610,3,"He probably loved to win as much as Lenglen, forinstance."
5611,3,"On the other hand, he was not angry at being beaten."
5612,3,When hefell in love with Brett his tennis game went all to pieces.
5613,3,People beathim who had never had a chance with him.
5614,3,"He was very nice about it.Anyhow, we were sitting on the terrace of the Café Select, and HarveyStone had just crossed the street.“Come on up to the Lilas,” I said.“I have a date.”“What time?”“Frances is coming here at seven-fifteen.”“There she is.”Frances Clyne was coming toward us from across the street."
5615,3,She was avery tall girl who walked with a great deal of movement.
5616,3,She waved andsmiled.
5617,3,"We watched her cross the street.“Hello,” she said, “I’m so glad you’re here, Jake."
5618,3,"I’ve been wanting totalk to you.”“Hello, Frances,” said Cohn."
5619,3,"He smiled.“Why, hello, Robert."
5620,3,"Are you here?” She went on, talking rapidly."
5621,3,“I’vehad the darndest time.
5622,3,"This one”—shaking her head at Cohn—“didn’t comehome for lunch.”“I wasn’t supposed to.”“Oh, I know."
5623,3,But you didn’t say anything about it to the cook.
5624,3,"Then Ihad a date myself, and Paula wasn’t at her office."
5625,3,"I went to the Ritzand waited for her, and she never came, and of course I didn’t haveenough money to lunch at the Ritz——”“What did you do?”“Oh, went out, of course.” She spoke in a sort of imitation joyfulmanner."
5626,3,“I always keep my appointments.
5627,3,"No one keeps theirs, nowadays."
5628,3,Iought to know better.
5629,3,"How are you, Jake, anyway?”“Fine.”“That was a fine girl you had at the dance, and then went off with thatBrett one.”“Don’t you like her?” Cohn asked.“I think she’s perfectly charming."
5630,3,"Don’t you?”Cohn said nothing.“Look, Jake."
5631,3,I want to talk with you.
5632,3,"Would you come over with me to theDome? You’ll stay here, won’t you, Robert? Come on, Jake.”We crossed the Boulevard Montparnasse and sat down at a table."
5633,3,"A boycame up with the _Paris Times_, and I bought one and opened it.“What’s the matter, Frances?”“Oh, nothing,” she said, “except that he wants to leave me.”“How do you mean?”“Oh, he told every one that we were going to be married, and I told mymother and every one, and now he doesn’t want to do it.”“What’s the matter?”“He’s decided he hasn’t lived enough."
5634,3,"I knew it would happen when hewent to New York.”She looked up, very bright-eyed and trying to talk inconsequentially.“I wouldn’t marry him if he doesn’t want to."
5635,3,Of course I wouldn’t.
5636,3,Iwouldn’t marry him now for anything.
5637,3,"But it does seem to me to be alittle late now, after we’ve waited three years, and I’ve just gotten mydivorce.”I said nothing.“We were going to celebrate so, and instead we’ve just had scenes."
5638,3,It’sso childish.
5639,3,"We have dreadful scenes, and he cries and begs me to bereasonable, but he says he just can’t do it.”“It’s rotten luck.”“I should say it is rotten luck."
5640,3,I’ve wasted two years and a half on himnow.
5641,3,And I don’t know now if any man will ever want to marry me.
5642,3,"Twoyears ago I could have married anybody I wanted, down at Cannes."
5643,3,All theold ones that wanted to marry somebody chic and settle down were crazyabout me.
5644,3,"Now I don’t think I could get anybody.”“Sure, you could marry anybody.”“No, I don’t believe it."
5645,3,"And I’m fond of him, too."
5646,3,And I’d like to havechildren.
5647,3,I always thought we’d have children.”She looked at me very brightly.
5648,3,"“I never liked children much, but Idon’t want to think I’ll never have them."
5649,3,"I always thought I’d have themand then like them.”“He’s got children.”“Oh, yes."
5650,3,"He’s got children, and he’s got money, and he’s got a richmother, and he’s written a book, and nobody will publish my stuff;nobody at all."
5651,3,"It isn’t bad, either."
5652,3,"And I haven’t got any money at all.I could have had alimony, but I got the divorce the quickest way.”She looked at me again very brightly.“It isn’t right."
5653,3,"It’s my own fault and it’s not, too."
5654,3,I ought to haveknown better.
5655,3,And when I tell him he just cries and says he can’t marry.Why can’t he marry? I’d be a good wife.
5656,3,I’m easy to get along with.
5657,3,Ileave him alone.
5658,3,"It doesn’t do any good.”“It’s a rotten shame.”“Yes, it is a rotten shame."
5659,3,"But there’s no use talking about it, isthere? Come on, let’s go back to the café.”“And of course there isn’t anything I can do.”“No."
5660,3,Just don’t let him know I talked to you.
5661,3,"I know what he wants.” Nowfor the first time she dropped her bright, terribly cheerful manner."
5662,3,"“Hewants to go back to New York alone, and be there when his book comes outso when a lot of little chickens like it."
5663,3,That’s what he wants.”“Maybe they won’t like it.
5664,3,I don’t think he’s that way.
5665,3,"Really.”“You don’t know him like I do, Jake."
5666,3,That’s what he wants to do.
5667,3,I knowit.
5668,3,I know it.
5669,3,That’s why he doesn’t want to marry.
5670,3,He wants to have abig triumph this fall all by himself.”“Want to go back to the café?”“Yes.
5671,3,"Come on.”We got up from the table—they had never brought us a drink—and startedacross the street toward the Select, where Cohn sat smiling at us frombehind the marble-topped table.“Well, what are you smiling at?” Frances asked him."
5672,3,"“Feel pretty happy?”“I was smiling at you and Jake with your secrets.”“Oh, what I’ve told Jake isn’t any secret."
5673,3,Everybody will know it soonenough.
5674,3,"I only wanted to give Jake a decent version.”“What was it? About your going to England?”“Yes, about my going to England."
5675,3,"Oh, Jake! I forgot to tell you."
5676,3,"I’mgoing to England.”“Isn’t that fine!”“Yes, that’s the way it’s done in the very best families."
5677,3,Robert’ssending me.
5678,3,He’s going to give me two hundred pounds and then I’m goingto visit friends.
5679,3,"Won’t it be lovely? The friends don’t know about it,yet.”She turned to Cohn and smiled at him."
5680,3,"He was not smiling now.“You were only going to give me a hundred pounds, weren’t you, Robert?But I made him give me two hundred."
5681,3,He’s really very generous.
5682,3,"Aren’tyou, Robert?”I do not know how people could say such terrible things to Robert Cohn.There are people to whom you could not say insulting things."
5683,3,"They giveyou a feeling that the world would be destroyed, would actually bedestroyed before your eyes, if you said certain things."
5684,3,But here wasCohn taking it all.
5685,3,"Here it was, all going on right before me, and I didnot even feel an impulse to try and stop it."
5686,3,"And this was friendlyjoking to what went on later.“How can you say such things, Frances?” Cohn interrupted.“Listen to him."
5687,3,I’m going to England.
5688,3,I’m going to visit friends.
5689,3,"Evervisit friends that didn’t want you? Oh, they’ll have to take me, allright."
5690,3,"‘How do you do, my dear? Such a long time since we’ve seen you.And how is your dear mother?’ Yes, how is my dear mother? She put allher money into French war bonds."
5691,3,"Yes, she did."
5692,3,Probably the only personin the world that did.
5693,3,‘And what about Robert?’ or else very carefultalking around Robert.
5694,3,"‘You must be most careful not to mention him, mydear."
5695,3,"Poor Frances has had a most unfortunate experience.’ Won’t it befun, Robert? Don’t you think it will be fun, Jake?”She turned to me with that terribly bright smile."
5696,3,"It was verysatisfactory to her to have an audience for this.“And where are you going to be, Robert? It’s my own fault, all right.Perfectly my own fault."
5697,3,When I made you get rid of your little secretaryon the magazine I ought to have known you’d get rid of me the same way.Jake doesn’t know about that.
5698,3,"Should I tell him?”“Shut up, Frances, for God’s sake.”“Yes, I’ll tell him."
5699,3,Robert had a little secretary on the magazine.
5700,3,"Justthe sweetest little thing in the world, and he thought she waswonderful, and then I came along and he thought I was pretty wonderful,too."
5701,3,"So I made him get rid of her, and he had brought her toProvincetown from Carmel when he moved the magazine, and he didn’t evenpay her fare back to the coast."
5702,3,All to please me.
5703,3,"He thought I waspretty fine, then."
5704,3,"Didn’t you, Robert?“You mustn’t misunderstand, Jake, it was absolutely platonic with thesecretary."
5705,3,Not even platonic.
5706,3,"Nothing at all, really."
5707,3,It was just thatshe was so nice.
5708,3,And he did that just to please me.
5709,3,"Well, I suppose thatwe that live by the sword shall perish by the sword."
5710,3,"Isn’t thatliterary, though? You want to remember that for your next book, Robert.“You know Robert is going to get material for a new book."
5711,3,"Aren’t you,Robert? That’s why he’s leaving me."
5712,3,He’s decided I don’t film well.
5713,3,"Yousee, he was so busy all the time that we were living together, writingon this book, that he doesn’t remember anything about us."
5714,3,So now he’sgoing out and get some new material.
5715,3,"Well, I hope he gets somethingfrightfully interesting.“Listen, Robert, dear."
5716,3,Let me tell you something.
5717,3,"You won’t mind, willyou? Don’t have scenes with your young ladies."
5718,3,Try not to.
5719,3,"Because youcan’t have scenes without crying, and then you pity yourself so much youcan’t remember what the other person’s said."
5720,3,You’ll never be able toremember any conversations that way.
5721,3,Just try and be calm.
5722,3,I know it’sawfully hard.
5723,3,"But remember, it’s for literature."
5724,3,We all ought to makesacrifices for literature.
5725,3,Look at me.
5726,3,I’m going to England without aprotest.
5727,3,All for literature.
5728,3,We must all help young writers.
5729,3,"Don’t youthink so, Jake? But you’re not a young writer."
5730,3,"Are you, Robert? You’rethirty-four."
5731,3,"Still, I suppose that is young for a great writer."
5732,3,Look atHardy.
5733,3,Look at Anatole France.
5734,3,He just died a little while ago.
5735,3,"Robertdoesn’t think he’s any good, though."
5736,3,Some of his French friends toldhim.
5737,3,He doesn’t read French very well himself.
5738,3,"He wasn’t a good writerlike you are, was he, Robert? Do you think he ever had to go and lookfor material? What do you suppose he said to his mistresses when hewouldn’t marry them? I wonder if he cried, too? Oh, I’ve just thought ofsomething.” She put her gloved hand up to her lips."
5739,3,"“I know the realreason why Robert won’t marry me, Jake."
5740,3,It’s just come to me.
5741,3,They’vesent it to me in a vision in the Café Select.
5742,3,Isn’t it mystic? Some daythey’ll put a tablet up.
5743,3,Like at Lourdes.
5744,3,"Do you want to hear, Robert?I’ll tell you."
5745,3,It’s so simple.
5746,3,"I wonder why I never thought about it.Why, you see, Robert’s always wanted to have a mistress, and if hedoesn’t marry me, why, then he’s had one."
5747,3,She was his mistress for overtwo years.
5748,3,"See how it is? And if he marries me, like he’s alwayspromised he would, that would be the end of all the romance."
5749,3,"Don’t youthink that’s bright of me to figure that out? It’s true, too."
5750,3,Look athim and see if it’s not.
5751,3,"Where are you going, Jake?”“I’ve got to go in and see Harvey Stone a minute.”Cohn looked up as I went in."
5752,3,His face was white.
5753,3,Why did he sit there?Why did he keep on taking it like that?As I stood against the bar looking out I could see them through thewindow.
5754,3,"Frances was talking on to him, smiling brightly, looking intohis face each time she asked: “Isn’t it so, Robert?” Or maybe she didnot ask that now."
5755,3,Perhaps she said something else.
5756,3,I told the barman Idid not want anything to drink and went out through the side door.
5757,3,As Iwent out the door I looked back through the two thicknesses of glass andsaw them sitting there.
5758,3,She was still talking to him.
5759,3,I went down a sidestreet to the Boulevard Raspail.
5760,3,A taxi came along and I got in and gavethe driver the address of my flat.
5761,3,"                               CHAPTER                                   7As I started up the stairs the concierge knocked on the glass of thedoor of her lodge, and as I stopped she came out."
5762,3,She had some lettersand a telegram.“Here is the post.
5763,3,And there was a lady here to see you.”“Did she leave a card?”“No.
5764,3,She was with a gentleman.
5765,3,It was the one who was here last night.In the end I find she is very nice.”“Was she with a friend of mine?”“I don’t know.
5766,3,He was never here before.
5767,3,He was very large.
5768,3,"Very, verylarge."
5769,3,She was very nice.
5770,3,"Very, very nice."
5771,3,"Last night she was, perhaps,a little—” She put her head on one hand and rocked it up and down.“I’ll speak perfectly frankly, Monsieur Barnes."
5772,3,Last night I found hernot so gentille.
5773,3,Last night I formed another idea of her.
5774,3,But listen towhat I tell you.
5775,3,"She is très, très gentille."
5776,3,She is of very good family.It is a thing you can see.”“They did not leave any word?”“Yes.
5777,3,"They said they would be back in an hour.”“Send them up when they come.”“Yes, Monsieur Barnes."
5778,3,"And that lady, that lady there is some one."
5779,3,"Aneccentric, perhaps, but quelqu’une, quelqu’une!”The concierge, before she became a concierge, had owned a drink-sellingconcession at the Paris race-courses."
5780,3,"Her life-work lay in the pelouse,but she kept an eye on the people of the pesage, and she took greatpride in telling me which of my guests were well brought up, which wereof good family, who were sportsmen, a French word pronounced with theaccent on the men."
5781,3,"The only trouble was that people who did not fallinto any of those three categories were very liable to be told there wasno one home, chez Barnes."
5782,3,"One of my friends, an extremelyunderfed-looking painter, who was obviously to Madame Duzinell neitherwell brought up, of good family, nor a sportsman, wrote me a letterasking if I could get him a pass to get by the concierge so he couldcome up and see me occasionally in the evenings.I went up to the flat wondering what Brett had done to the concierge.The wire was a cable from Bill Gorton, saying he was arriving on the_France_."
5783,3,"I put the mail on the table, went back to the bedroom,undressed and had a shower."
5784,3,I was rubbing down when I heard thedoor-bell pull.
5785,3,I put on a bathrobe and slippers and went to the door.It was Brett.
5786,3,Back of her was the count.
5787,3,"He was holding a great bunch ofroses.“Hello, darling,” said Brett."
5788,3,“Aren’t you going to let us in?”“Come on.
5789,3,I was just bathing.”“Aren’t you the fortunate man.
5790,3,Bathing.”“Only a shower.
5791,3,"Sit down, Count Mippipopolous."
5792,3,"What will you drink?”“I don’t know whether you like flowers, sir,” the count said, “but Itook the liberty of just bringing these roses.”“Here, give them to me.” Brett took them."
5793,3,"“Get me some water in this,Jake.” I filled the big earthenware jug with water in the kitchen, andBrett put the roses in it, and placed them in the centre of thedining-room table.“I say."
5794,3,We have had a day.”“You don’t remember anything about a date with me at the Crillon?”“No.
5795,3,"Did we have one? I must have been blind.”“You were quite drunk, my dear,” said the count.“Wasn’t I, though? And the count’s been a brick, absolutely.”“You’ve got hell’s own drag with the concierge now.”“I ought to have."
5796,3,"Gave her two hundred francs.”“Don’t be a damned fool.”“His,” she said, and nodded at the count.“I thought we ought to give her a little something for last night."
5797,3,"Itwas very late.”“He’s wonderful,” Brett s."
5798,3,"HE LAY flat on the brown, pine-needled floor of the forest, his chin on his folded arms, and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees."
5799,3,The mountainside sloped gently where he lay; but below it was steep and he could see the dark of the oiled road wind? ing through the pass.
5800,3,"There was a stream alongside the road and far down the pass he saw a mill beside the stream and the falling water of the dam, white in the summer sunlight.""Is that the mill?"" he asked."
5801,3,"""Yes,""""I do not remember it.""  ""It was built since you were here."
5802,3,"The old mill is farther down; much below the pass.""  He spread the photostated military map out on the forest floor and looked at it carefully."
5803,3,The old man looked over his shoulder.
5804,3,He was a short and solid old man in a black peasant's smock and gray iron? stiff trousers and he wore rope-soled shoes.
5805,3,"He was breathing heavily from the climb and his hand rested on one of the two heavy packs they had been carrying.""Then you cannot see the bridge from here.""  ""No,"" the old man said."
5806,3,"""This is the easy country of the pass where the stream flows gently."
5807,3,"Below, where the road turns out of sight in the trees, it drops suddenly and there is a steep gorge-""""I remember.""""Across this gorge is the bridge."" ""And where are their posts?""""There is a post at the mill that you see there.""  The young man, who was studying the country, took his glasses from the pocket of his faded, khaki flannel shirt, wiped the lenses with a handkerchief, screwed the eyepieces around until the boards of the mill showed suddenly clearly and he saw the wooden bench beside the door; the huge pile of sawdust that rose behind the open shed where the circular saw was, and a stretch of the flume that brought the logs down from the mountainside on the other bank of the stream."
5808,3,"The stream showed clear and smooth-looking in the glasses and, below the curl of the falling water, the spray from the dam was blowing in the wind.""There is no sentry.""  ""There is smoke coming from the millhouse,"" the old man said."
5809,3,"""There are also clothes hanging on a line.""""I see them but I do not see any sentry.""   ""Perhaps he is in the shade,"" the old man explained."
5810,3,"""It is hot there now."
5811,3,"He would be in the shadow at the end we do not see.""""Probably."
5812,3,"Where is the next post?""  ""Below the bridge."
5813,3,"It is at the roadmender's hut at kilometer five from the top of the pass.""""How many men are here?"" He pointed at the mill."
5814,3,"""Perhaps four and a corporal.""""And below?""""More."
5815,3,"I will find out."" ""And at the bridge?""""Always two."
5816,3,"One at each end.""  ""We will need a certain number of men,"" he said."
5817,3,"""How many men can you get?""  ""I can bring as many men as you wish,"" the old man said."
5818,3,"""There are many men now here in the hills.""""How many?""""There are more than a hundred."
5819,3,"But they are in small bands.How many men will you need?""""I will let you know when we have studied the bridge."" ""Do you wish to study it now?""  ""No."
5820,3,Now I wish to go to where we will hide this explosive until it is time.
5821,3,"I would like to have it hidden in utmost security at a distance no greater than half an hour from the bridge, if that is possible.""  ""That is simple,"" the old man said."
5822,3,"""From where we are going, it will all be downhill to the bridge."
5823,3,But now we must climb a little in seriousness to get there.
5824,3,"Are you hungry?""  ""Yes,"" the young man said."
5825,3,"""But we will eat later."
5826,3,"How are you called? I have forgotten."" It was a bad sign to him that he had for? gotten.FOR  WHOM  TH E  B E LL  T O LLS	3  ""Anselmo,"" the old man said."
5827,3,"""I am called Anselmo and I come from Barco de Avila."
5828,3,"Let me help you with that pack.""  The young man, who was tall and thin, with sun-streaked fair hair, and a wind- and sun-burned face, who wore the sun-faded flannel shirt, a pair of peasant's trousers and rope-soled shoes, leaned over, put his arm through one of the leather pack straps and swung the heavy pack up onto his shoulders."
5829,3,He worked his arm through the other strap and settled the weight of the pack against his back.
5830,3,"His shirt was still wet from where the pack had rested.""I have it up now,"" he said."
5831,3,"""How do we go?"" ""We climb,"" Anselmo said."
5832,3," Bending under the weight of the packs, sweating, they climbed steadily in the pine forest that covered the mountainside."
5833,3,"There was no trail that the young man could see, but they were working up and around the face of the mountain and now they crossed a small stream and the old man went steadily on ahead up the edge of the rocky stream bed."
5834,3,"The climbing now was steeper and more difficult, until finally the stream seemed to drop down over the edge of a smooth granite ledge that rose above them and the old man waited at the foot of the ledge for the young man to come up to him.""How are you making it?""  ""All right,"" the young man said."
5835,3,He was sweating heavily and his thigh muscles were twitchy from the steepness of the climb.
5836,3," ""Wait here now for me."
5837,3,I go ahead to warn them.
5838,3,"You do not want to be shot at carrying that stuff.""""Not even in a joke,"" the young man said."
5839,3,"""Is it far?"" ""It is very close."
5840,3,"How do they call thee?""  ""Roberto,"" the young man answered."
5841,3,"He had slipped the pack off and lowered it gently down between two boulders by the stream bed.""Wait here, then, Roberto, and I will return for you.""  ""Good,"" the young man said."
5842,3,"""But do you plan to go down this way to the bridge?""  ""No."
5843,3,When we go to the bridge it will be by another way.
5844,3,"Shorter and easier.""""I do not want this material to be stored too far from the bridge."" ""You will see."
5845,3,"If you are not satisfied, we will take another place."" ""We will see,"" the young man said."
5846,3, He sat by the packs and watched the old man climb the ledge.
5847,3,It was not hard to climb and from the way he found hand-holds with? out searching for them the young man could see that he had climbed it many times before.
5848,3,Yet whoever was above had been very careful not to leave any trail.
5849,3," The young man, whose name was Robert Jordan, was extremely hungry and he was worried."
5850,3,He was often hungry but he was not usually worried because he did not give any importance to what happened to himself and he knew from experience how simple it was to move behind the enemy lines in all this country.
5851,3,"It was as simple to move behind them as it was to cross through them, if you had a good guide."
5852,3,It was only giving importance to what hap? pened to you if you were caught that made it difficult; that and deciding whom to trust.
5853,3,"You had to trust the people you worked with completely or not at all, and you had to make decisions about the trusting."
5854,3,He was not worried about any of that.
5855,3,But there were other things.
5856,3, This Anselmo had been a good guide and he could travel wonder? fully in the mountains.
5857,3,Robert Jordan could walk well enough him? self and he knew from following him since before daylight that the old man could walk him to death.
5858,3,"Robert Jordan trusted the man, Anselmo, so far, in everything except judgment."
5859,3,"He had not yet had an opportunity to test his judgment, and, anyway, the judgment was his own responsibility."
5860,3,"No, he did not worry about Anselmo and the problem of the bridge was no more difficult than many other prob? lems."
5861,3,He knew how to blow any sort of bridge that you could name and he had blown them of all sizes and constructions.
5862,3,"There was enough explosive and all equipment in the two packs to blow this bridge properly even if it were twice as big as Anselmo reported it,as he remembered it when he had walked over it on his way to La Granja on a walking trip in 1933, and as Golz had read him the de? scription of it night before last in that upstairs room in the house out? side of the Escorial."
5863,3," ""To blow the bridge is nothing,"" Golz had said, the lamplight on his scarred,shaved head,pointing with a pencil on the big map."
5864,3,"""You  """"Yes, I understand.""""Absolutely nothing."
5865,3,"Merely to blow the bridge is a failure.""""Yes, Comrade General."
5866,3,"""  ""To blow the bridge at a stated hour based on the time set for the attack is how it should be done."
5867,3,You see that naturalIy.
5868,3,"That is your right and how it should be done.""Golz looked at the pencil,then tapped his teeth with it."
5869,3,Robert Jordan had said nothing.
5870,3," ""You understand that is your right and how it should be done,"" Golz went on, looking at him and nodding his head."
5871,3,He tapped on the map now with the pencil.
5872,3,"""That is how I should do it."
5873,3,That is what we cannot have.
5874,3,"""""Why,Comrade General?""  ""Why?"" Golz said, angrily."
5875,3,"""How many attacks have you seen and you ask me why? What is to guarantee that my orders are not changed? What is to guarantee that the attack is not annulled? What is to guarantee that the attack is not postponed?What is to guarantee that it starts within six hours of when it should start? Has any attack ever been as it should?""""It wilI start on time if it is your attack,"" Robert Jordan said."
5876,3," ""They are never my attacks,"" Golz said."
5877,3,"""I make them."
5878,3,But they are not mine.
5879,3,The artillery is not mine.
5880,3,I must put in for it.
5881,3,I have never been given what I ask for even when they have it to give.
5882,3,That is the least of it.
5883,3,There are other things.
5884,3,You know how those people are.
5885,3,It is not necessary to go into all of it.
5886,3,Always there is something.
5887,3,Always some one will interfere.
5888,3,So now be sure you understand.
5889,3,"""""So when is the bridge to be blown?"" Robert  had asked."
5890,3,"""After the attack starts."
5891,3,As soon as the attack has started and notbefore.
5892,3,So that no reinforcements will come up over that road.
5893,3,""" He pointed with his pencil."
5894,3,"""I must know that nothing wilI come up over that road.""""And when is the attack?""  ""I will tell you."
5895,3,But you are to use the date and hour only as an indication of a probability.
5896,3,You must be ready for that time.
5897,3,You will blow the bridge after the attack has started.
5898,3,"You see?"" he in? dicated with the pencil."
5899,3,"""That is the only road on which they can bring up reinforcements."
5900,3,"That is the only road on which they can get up tanks, or artillery, or even move a truck toward the pass which I attack."
5901,3,I  know that bridge is gone.
5902,3,"Not before, so itcan be repaired if the attack is postponed."
5903,3,No.
5904,3,It must go when the attack starts and I must know it is gone.
5905,3,There are only two sentries.
5906,3,The man who will go with you has just  from there.
5907,3,"He is avery reliable man, they say."
5908,3,You will see.
5909,3,He has people in the moun? tains.
5910,3,Get as many men as you need.
5911,3,"Use as few as possible, but use enough."
5912,3,"I do not have to tell you these ""And how do I determine that the attack has started?""  ""It is to be made with a full division."
5913,3,There will be an aerial bom? bardment as preparation.
5914,3,"You are not deaf,are you?""  ""Then 1 may take it that when the planes unload, the attack has started?""  ""You could not always take it like that,"" Golz said and shook his head."
5915,3,"""But in this case, you may."
5916,3,It is my attack.
5917,3,"""""I understand it,"" Robert Jordan had said."
5918,3,"""I do not say I like itvery much."
5919,3,"""  ""Neither do I like it very much."
5920,3,"If you do not want to undertake it, say so now."
5921,3,"If you think you cannot do it,say so now."
5922,3,"""""I will do it,"" Robert Jordan had said."
5923,3,"""I will do it all right."
5924,3,"""  ""That is all I have to know,"" Golz said."
5925,3,"""That nothing comes up over that bridge."
5926,3,That is absolute.
5927,3,"""""I understand."
5928,3,"""  ""I do not like to ask people to do such things and in such a way,"" Golz went on."
5929,3,"""I could not order you to do it."
5930,3,I understand what you may be forced to do through my putting such conditions.
5931,3,1 explain very carefully so that you understand and that you understand all of the possible difficulties and the importance.
5932,3,"""  ""And how will you advance on La Granja if that bridge is blown?""  ""We go forward prepared to repair it after we have stormed the pass."
5933,3,It is a very complicated and beautiful operation.
5934,3,As complicated and as beautiful as always.
5935,3,The plan has been manufactured in Madrid.
5936,3,"It is another of Vicente Rojo, the unsuccessful professor's, masterpieces."
5937,3,"I make the attack and I make it, as always, not in suffi? cient force."
5938,3,"It is a very possible operation, in spite of that."
5939,3,I am much happier about it than usual.
5940,3,It can be successful with that bridge eliminated.
5941,3,We can take Segovia.
5942,3,"Look, I show you how it goes."
5943,3,You see? It is not the top of the pass where we attack.
5944,3,We hold that.
5945,3,It is much beyond.
5946,3,"Look- Here- Like this-- """"I would rather not know,"" Robert Jordan said."
5947,3," ""Good,"" said Golz."
5948,3,"""It is less of baggage to carry with you on the other side,yes?""  ""I would always rather not know."
5949,3,"Then, no matter what can hap? pen, it was not me that talked.""  ""It is better not to know,"" Golz stroked his forehead with the pen? cil."
5950,3,"""Many times I wish I did not know myself."
5951,3,"But you do know the one thing you must know about the bridge?""""Yes.I know that.""  ""I believe you do,"" Golz said."
5952,3,"""I will not make you any little speech."
5953,3,Let us now have a drink.
5954,3,"So much talking makes me very thirsty, Comrade Hordan."
5955,3,"You have a funny name in Spanish, Com? rade Hordown.""""How do you say Golz in Spanish,Comrade General?""  ""Hotze,"" said Golz grinning, making the sound deep in his throat as though hawking with a bad cold."
5956,3,"""Hotze,"" he croaked."
5957,3,"""Comrade Heneral Khotze."
5958,3,If I had known how they pronounced Golz in Spanish I would pick me out a better name before I come to war here.
5959,3,When I think I come to command a division and I can pick out any name I want and I pick out Hotze.
5960,3,HeneralHotze.
5961,3,Now it is too late to change.
5962,3,"How do you like partizanwork?"" It was the Russian term for guerilla work behind the lines."
5963,3," ""Very much,"" Robert Jordan said."
5964,3,He grinned.
5965,3,"""It is very healthy in the open air.""  ""I like it very much when I was your age, too,"" Golz said."
5966,3,"""They tell me you blow bridges very well."
5967,3,Very scientific.
5968,3,It is only hearsay.
5969,3,I have never seen you do anything myself.
5970,3,Maybe nothing ever hap?pens really.
5971,3,"You really blow them? "" he was teasing now."
5972,3,"""Drink this,"" he handed the glass of Spanish brandy to Robert Jordan."
5973,3,"""You really blow them?""""Sometimes.""  ""You better not have any sometimes on this bridge."
5974,3,"No, let us not talk any more about this bridge."
5975,3,You understand enough now about that bridge.
5976,3,We are very serious so we can make very strongjokes.
5977,3,"Look, do you have many girls on the other side of thelines?""""No, there is no time for girls.""  ""I do not agree."
5978,3,"The more irregular the service, the more ir? regular the life."
5979,3,You have very irregular service.
5980,3,"Also you need a haircut.""""I have my hair cut as it needs it,"" Robert Jordan said."
5981,3,He wouldbe damned if he would have his head shaved like Golz.
5982,3,"""I have enough to think about without girls,"" he said sullenly."
5983,3," ""What sort of uniform am I supposed to wear?"" Robert Jordan asked."
5984,3," ""None,"" Golz said."
5985,3,"""Your haircut is all right."
5986,3,I tease you.
5987,3,"You are very different from me,"" Golz had said and filled up the glasses agam.""You never think about only girls."
5988,3,I never think at all.
5989,3,Why shouldI? I am General Sovietique.
5990,3,I never think.
5991,3,Do not try to trap me into thinking.
5992,3,"""  Some one on his staff, sitting on a chair working over a map on a drawing board, growled at him in the language Robert Jordan did not understand.""Shut up,"" Golz had said, in English."
5993,3,"""I joke if I want."
5994,3,I am so se?rious is why I can joke.
5995,3,Now drink this and  go.
5996,3,"You under? stand,huh?""""Yes,"" Robert Jordan had said."
5997,3,"""I understand.""  They had shaken hands and he had saluted  gone out to the staff car where the old man was waiting asleep and in that car they had ridden over the road past Guadarrama, the old man still asleep, and up the Navacerrada road to the Alpine Club hut where he, Rebert Jordan, slept for three hours before they started."
5998,3," That was the last he had seen of Golz with his strange white face that never tanned, his hawk eyes, the big nose and thin lips and the shaven head crossed with wrinkles and with scars."
5999,3,"Tomor? row night they would be outside the Escorial in the dark along the road; the long lines of trucks loading the infantry in the darkness; the men, heavy loaded, climbing up into the trucks; the machine? gun sections lifting their guns into the trucks; the tanks being run up on the skids onto the long-bodied tank trucks;		the Di? vision out to move them in the night for the attack on the pass."
6000,3,He would not think about that.
6001,3,"That was not his	That was Golz's business."
6002,3,"He had only one thing to do and that was what he should think about and he must think it out clearly and takeeverything as it came along, and not worry."
6003,3,To worry was as bad as to be afraid.
6004,3,It simply made things more difficult.
6005,3," He sat no by the stream watching the clear water flowing between the rocks and, across the stream, he noticed there was a thick bed of watercress."
6006,3,"He crossed the stream, picked a double handful, washed the muddy roots clean in the current and then sat down again beside his pack and ate the clean, cool green leaves and the crisp, peppery-tasting stalks."
6007,3,"He knelt by the stream and, pushing his automatic pistol around on his belt to the small of his back so that it would not be wet, he lowered himself with a hand on each of two boulders and drank from the stream."
6008,3,The water was achingly cold.
6009,3, Pushing himself up on his hands he turned his head and saw the old man coming down the ledge.
6010,3,"With him was another man, also in a black peasant's smock and the dark gray trousers that were almost a uniform in that province, wearing rope-soled shoes and with a car? bine slung over his back."
6011,3,This man was bareheaded.
6012,3,The two of them came scrambling down the rock like goats.They came up to him and Robert Jordan got to his feet.
6013,3," ""Sa Iud, Camarada, "" he said to the man with the carbine and smiled.""Salud, "" the other said, grudgingly."
6014,3,"Robert Jordan looked at theman's heavy, beard-stubbled face."
6015,3,It was almost round and his head was round and set close on his shoulders.
6016,3,His eyes were small and set too wide apart and his ears were small and set close to his head.
6017,3,"He was a heavy	about five feet ten inches tall and his hands and feet were large."
6018,3,"His nose had been broken and his mouth was cut at one corner and the		of the scar across the upper lip and lower jaw showed through the growth of beard over his face.The old man nodded his head at this man and smiled."
6019,3," ""He is the boss here,"" he grinned,then flexed his arms as though to make the muscles stand out and looked at the man with the carbine in a half-mocking  "" A very strong man."
6020,3,"""""I can see it,"" Robert Jordan said and smiled again."
6021,3,He did notlike the look of this man and inside himself he was not smiling at all.
6022,3," ""What have you to justify your identity? "" asked the man with the carbine."
6023,3," Robert Jordan unpinned a safety pin that ran through his pocket flap and took a folded paper out of the left breast pocket of his flan? nel shirt and handed it to the man, who opened it, looked at it doubt? fully and turned it in his hands.So he cannot read, Robert Jordan noted."
6024,3,"""Look at the seal,"" he said."
6025,3," The old man pointed to the seal and the man with the carbine studied it,turning it in his fingers.""What seal is that?"" ""Have you never seen it?"" ""No.""  ""There are two,"" said Robert Jordan."
6026,3,"""One is S."
6027,3,1
6028,3,"M., the service of the military intelligence.The other is the General Staff.""  ""Yes, I have seen that seal before."
6029,3,"But here no one commands but me,"" the other said sullenly."
6030,3,"""What have you in the packs?""  ""Dynamite,"" the old man said proudly."
6031,3,"""Last night we crossed the lines in the dark and all day we have carried this dynamite over the mountain.""""I can use dynamite,"" said the man with the carbine."
6032,3,He handedback the paper to Robert Jordan and looked him over.
6033,3,"""Yes."
6034,3,I have use for dynamite.
6035,3,"How much have you brought me?""  ""I have brought you no dynamite,"" Robert Jordan said to him evenly."
6036,3,"""The dynamite is for another purpose."
6037,3,"What is your name?""""What is that to you?""  ""He is Pablo,"" said the old man."
6038,3,"The man with the carbine looked at them both sullenly.""Good."
6039,3,"I have heard much good of you,"" said Robert Jordan."
6040,3,"""What have you heard of me?"" asked Pablo."
6041,3," ""I have heard that you are an excellent guerilla leader, that you are loyal to the republic and prove your loyalty through your acts, and that you are a man both serious and valiant."
6042,3,"I bring you greetings from the General Staff.""  ""Where did you hear all this?"" asked Pablo."
6043,3,"Robert Jordan regis? tered that he was not taking any of the flattery.""I heard it from Buitrago to the Escorial,"" he said, naming all thestretch of country on the other side of the lines.""I know no one in Buitrago nor in Escorial,"" Pablo told him.F O R W H O M  T H E  BE L L  T O L LS	II  ""There are many people on the other side of the mountains who were not there before."
6044,3,"Where are you from?""""Avila."
6045,3,"What are you going to do with the dynamite?"" ""Blow up a bridge."
6046,3,"""""What bridge?"" ""That is my business.""  ""If it is in this territory, it is my business."
6047,3,You cannot blow bridges close to where you live.
6048,3,You must live in one place and operate in an? other.
6049,3,"I know my  One who is alive,now,after a year,knows his business.""  ""This is my business,"" Robert Jordan said."
6050,3,"""We can discuss it to? gether."
6051,3,"Do you wish to help us with the sacks?""""No,"" said Pablo and shook his head."
6052,3, The old man turned toward him suddenly and spoke rapidly and fu? riously in a dialect that Robert Jordan could just follow.It was like read? ing Quevedo.
6053,3,"Anselmo was speaking old Castilian and it went something like this,""Art thou a brute?Yes.Art thou a beast?Yes,many times."
6054,3,Hast thou a brain? Nay.
6055,3,None.
6056,3,"Now we come for something of consummate importance and thee,with thy dwelling place to be undis? turbed,puts thy fox-hole before the interests of humanity."
6057,3,Before the in? terests of thy people.
6058,3,I this and that in the this and that of thy father.Ithis and that and that in thy this.Pick up that bag.
6059,3,"""Pablo looked down."
6060,3," ""Every one has to do what he can do according to how it can be truly done,"" he said."
6061,3,"""I live here and I operate beyond Segovia."
6062,3,"If you make a disturbance here, we will be hunted out of these mountains."
6063,3,It is only by doing nothing here that we are able to live in these mountains.
6064,3,"It is the principle of the fox.""  ""Yes,"" said Anselmo bitterly."
6065,3,"""It is the principle of the fox when we need the wolf."
6066,3,"""  ""I am more wolf than thee,"" Pablo said and Robert Jordan knew that he would pick up the sack."
6067,3," ""Hi."
6068,3,Ho .
6069,3,.
6070,3,.
6071,3,","" Anselmo looked at him."
6072,3,"""Thou art more wolf than me and I am sixty-eight years old."
6073,3,"""He spat on the ground and shook his head."
6074,3," ""You have that  years?"" Robert Jordan asked, seeing that now, for the moment, it would be all right and trying to make it go eaSler.""Sixty-eight in the month of July.""  ""If we should ever see that month,"" said Pablo."
6075,3,"""Let me help you with the pack,"" he said to Robert Jordan."
6076,3,"""Leave the other to the old man."" He spoke, not sullenly, but almost sadly now."
6077,3,"""He is an old man of great strength.""""I will carry the pack,"" Robert Jordan said.""Nay,"" said the old man."
6078,3,"""Leave it to this other strong man.""  ""I will take it,"" Pablo told him, and in his sullenness there was a sadness that was disturbing to Robert Jordan."
6079,3,He knew that sadness and to see it here worried him.
6080,3," ""Give me the carbine then,"" he said and when Pablo handed it to him, he slung it over his back and, with the two men climbing ahead of him, they went heavily, pulling and climbing up the granite shelf and over its upper edge to where there was a green clearing in the forest."
6081,3," They skirted the edge of the little meadow and Robert Jordan, striding easily now without the pack, the carbine pleasantly rigid over his shoulder after the heavy, sweating pack weight, noticed that the grass was cropped down in several places and signs that picket pins had been driven into the earth."
6082,3,He could see a trail through the grass where horses had been led to the stream to drink and there was the fresh manure of several horses.
6083,3,"They picket them here to feed at night and keep them out of sight in the timber in the daytime, he thought."
6084,3,"I wonder how many horses this Pablo has ?  He remembered now noticing, without realizing  it,  that Pablo'strousers were worn soapy shiny in the  and thighs."
6085,3,"I wonder if he has a pair of boots or if he rides in those alpargatas, hethought."
6086,3,He must have quite𠡮 outfit.
6087,3,"But I don't like that sad? ness, he thought."
6088,3,That sadness is bad.
6089,3,That's the sadness they getbefore they quit or before they betray.
6090,3,That is the sadness that comes before the sell-out.
6091,3," Ahead of them a horse whinnied in the timber and then, through the brown trunks of the pine trees, only a little sunlight coming down through their thick, almost-touching tops, he saw the corral made by roping around the tree trunks."
6092,3,"The horses had their heads pointed toward the men as they approached, and at the foot of a tree,outside the corral, the saddles were piled together and covered with a tarpaulin."
6093,3," As they came up, the two men with the packs stopped, and Robert Jordan knew it was for him to admire the horses."
6094,3," ""Yes,"" he said."
6095,3,"""They are beautiful."" He turned to Pablo."
6096,3,"""You have your cavalry and all.""  There were five horses in the rope corral, three bays, a sorrel, and a buckskin."
6097,3,"Sorting them out carefully with his eyes after he had seen them first together, Robert Jordan looked them over individually."
6098,3,"Pablo and Anselmo knew how good they were and while Pablo stood now proud and less sad-looking, watching them lovingly, the old man acted as though they were some great surprise that he had pro? duced, suddenly, himself.""How do they look to you?"" he asked."
6099,3," ""All these I have taken,"" Pablo said and Robert Jordan was pleased to hear him speak proudly."
6100,3," ""That,"" said Robert Jordan, pointing to one of the bays, a big stal? lion with a white blaze on his forehead and a single white foot, the near front, ""is much horse.""  He was a beautiful horse that looked as though he had come out of a painting by Velasquez.""They are all good,"" said Pablo."
6101,3,"""You know horses?"" ""Yes.""""Less bad,"" said Pablo."
6102,3,"""Do you see a defect in one of these?""   Robert Jordan knew that now his papers were being examined by the man who could not read."
6103,3, The horses all still had their heads up looking at the man.
6104,3,Robert Jordan slipped through between the double rope of the corral and slapped the buckskin on the haunch.
6105,3,"He leaned back against the ropes of the enclosure and watched the horses circle the corral, stood watching them a minute more, as they stood still, then leaned down and came out through the ropes."
6106,3," ""The sorrel is lame in the off hind foot,"" he said to Pablo, not look? ing at him."
6107,3,"""The hoof is split and although it might not get worse soon if shod properly, she could break down if she travels over much hard ground.""""The hoof was like that when we took her,"" Pablo said."
6108,3," ""The best horse that you have, the white-faced bay stallion, has a swelling on the upper part of the cannon bone that I do not like.""  ""It 1S nothing,"" said Pablo."
6109,3,"""He knocked it three days ago."
6110,3,"If it were to be anything it would have become so already.""  He pulled back the tarpaulin and showed the saddles."
6111,3,"There were two ordinary vaquero's or herdsman's saddles,  American stock saddles, one very ornate vaquero's saddle, with hand-tooled leather and heavy, hooded stirrups, and two military saddles in black leather."
6112,3," ""We killed a pair of guardia civil, "" he said, explaining the military saddles.""That is big game.""  ""They had dismounted on the road between Segovia and Santa Maria del Real."
6113,3,They had dismounted to ask papers of the driver of a cart.
6114,3,"We were able to kill them without injuring the horses.""""Have you killed many civil guards?"" Robert Jordan asked."
6115,3,"""Several,"" Pablo said."
6116,3,"""But only these two without injury to thehorses.""  ""It was Pablo who blew up the train at Arevalo,"" Anselmo said."
6117,3,"""That was Pablo.""  ""There was a foreigner with us who made the explosion,"" Pablo said."
6118,3,"""Do you know him ?"" ""What is he called ?"" ""I do not remember."
6119,3,"It was a very rare name."" ""What did he look like?""   ""He was fair, as you are, but not as tall and with large hands and a broken nose.""""Kashkin,"" Robert Jordan said."
6120,3,"""That would be Kashkin.""  ""Yes,"" said Pablo."
6121,3,"""It was a very rare name."
6122,3,Something like that.
6123,3,"What has become of him?""""He is dead since April.""  ""That is what happens to everybody,"" Pablo said, gloomily."
6124,3,"""That is the way we will all finish.""   ""That is the way all men end,"" Anselmo said."
6125,3,"""That is the way men have always ended."
6126,3,"What is the matter with you, man? What hast thou in the stomach? ""  ""They are very strong,"" Pablo said ."
6127,3,It was as though he were talking to himself.
6128,3,He looked at the horses gloomily.
6129,3,"""You do not realize how strong they are."
6130,3,"I seem them always stronger, always better armed."
6131,3,Always with more material.
6132,3,Here am I with horseslike these .
6133,3,And what can I look forward to? To be hunted and to die.
6134,3,"Nothing more.""""You hunt as much as you are hunted,"" Anselmo said."
6135,3," ""No,"" said Pablo."
6136,3,"""Not any more."
6137,3,"And if we leave these mountains now, where can we go ?  me that? Where now ?""  ""In Spain there are many mountains."
6138,3,"There are the Sierra de Gre? dos if one leaves here.""  ""Not for me,"" Pablo said."
6139,3,"""I am tired of being hunted."
6140,3,Here we are all right.
6141,3,"Now if you blow a bridge here, we will be hunted."
6142,3,"If they know we are here and hunt for us with planes, they will find us."
6143,3,"If they send Moors to hunt us out, they will find us and we must go."
6144,3,I am tired of all this.
6145,3,"You hear?"" He turned to Robert Jordan."
6146,3,"""What right have you, a foreigner, to come to me and tell me what I must do?""  ""I have not told you anything you must do,"" Robert Jordan said to him.""You will though,"" Pablo said."
6147,3,"""There."
6148,3,"There is the badness.""  He pointed at the two heavy packs that they had lowered to the ground while they had watched the horses."
6149,3,Seeing the horses had seemed to bring this all to a head in him and seeing that Robert Jor? dan knew horses had seemed to loosen his tongue.
6150,3,The three of them stood now by the rope corral and the patchy sunlight shone on the coat of the bay stallion.
6151,3,Pablo looked at him and then pushed with his foot against the heavy pack.
6152,3,"""There is the badness.""  ""I come  for my duty,"" Robert Jordan told him."
6153,3,"""I come under orders from those who are conducting the war."
6154,3,"If I ask you to help me, you can refuse and I will find others who will help me."
6155,3,I have not even asked you for help yet.
6156,3,I have to do what I am ordered to do and I can promise you of its importance.
6157,3,That I am a foreigner is not my fault.
6158,3,"I would rather have been born here.""  ""To me, now, the most important is that we be not disturbed here,"" Pablo said."
6159,3,"""To me, now, my duty is to those who are with me and to myself.""  ""Thyself."
6160,3,"Yes,"" Anselmo said."
6161,3,"""Thyself now since a long time."
6162,3,Thyself and thy horses.
6163,3,Until thou hadst horses thou wert with us.
6164,3,"Now thou art another capitalist more.""  ""That is unjust,"" said Pablo."
6165,3,"""I expose the horses all the time for the cause.""16	Ernest  Hemingway  ""Very little,"" said Anselmo scornfully."
6166,3,"""Very little in my judgment."
6167,3,"To steal, yes."
6168,3,"To eat well, yes."
6169,3,"To murder, yes."
6170,3,"To fight, no.""  ""You are an old man who will make himself trouble with his mouth.""  ""I am an old man who is afraid of no one,"" Anselmo told him."
6171,3,"""Also I am an old man without horses.""""You are an old man who may not live long.""  ""I am an old man who will live until I die,"" Anselmo said."
6172,3,"""And I am not afraid of foxes.""Pablo said nothing but picked up the pack."
6173,3," ""Nor of wolves either,"" Anselmo said, picking up the other pack."
6174,3,"""If thou art a wolf""  ""Shut thy mouth,"" Pablo said to him."
6175,3,"""Thou art an old man who always talks too much.""  ""And would do whatever he said he would do,"" Anselmo said, bent under the pack."
6176,3,"""And who now is hungry."
6177,3,And thirsty.
6178,3,"Go on, guerilla leader with the sad face."
6179,3,"Lead us to something to eat.""  It is starting badly enough, Robert Jordan thought."
6180,3,But Anselmo's a man.
6181,3,"They are wonderful when they are good, he thought."
6182,3,There is no people like them when they are good and when they go bad there is no people that is worse.
6183,3,Anselmo must have known what he was doing when he brought us here.
6184,3,But I don't like it.
6185,3,I don't like any of it.
6186,3, The only good sign was that Pablo was carrying the pack and that he had given him the carbine.
6187,3,"Perhaps he is always like that, Robert Jordan thought."
6188,3,Maybe he is just one of the gloomy ones.
6189,3," No, he said to himself, don't fool yourself You do not know how he was before; but you do know that he is going bad fast and without hiding it."
6190,3,When he starts to hide it he will have made a decision.
6191,3,"Remember that, he told himself The first friendly thing he does, he will have made a decision."
6192,3,"They are awfully good horses, though, he thought, beautiful horses."
6193,3,I wonder what could make me feel the way those horses make Pablo feel.
6194,3,The old man was right.
6195,3,The horses made him rich and as soon as he was rich he wanted to enjoy life.
6196,3,"Pretty soon he'll feel bad because he can't join the Jockey Club, I guess, he thought."
6197,3,Pauvre Pablo.
6198,3,II a manque  Jockey.
6199,3, That idea made him feel better.
6200,3,"He grinned, looking at the two bent backs and the big packs ahead of him moving through the trees."
6201,3,He had not made any jokes with himself all day and now that he had made one he felt much better.
6202,3,"You're getting to be as all the rest of them, he told himself."
6203,3,"You're getting gloomy, too."
6204,3,He'd certainly been solemn and gloomy with Golz.
6205,3,The job had overwhelmed him a little.
6206,3,"Slightly overwhelmed, he thought."
6207,3,Plenty overwhelmed.
6208,3,"Golz was gay and he had wanted him to be gay too before he left, but he hadn't been."
6209,3," All the best ones, when you thought it over, were gay."
6210,3,It was much better to be gay and it was a sign of something too.
6211,3,It was like having immortality while you were still alive.
6212,3,That was a complicated one.
6213,3,There were not many of them left though.
6214,3,"No, there were not many of the gay ones left."
6215,3,There were very damned few of them left.
6216,3,"And if you keep on thinking like that, my boy, you won't be left either."
6217,3,"Turn off the thinking now, old timer, old comrade."
6218,3,You're a bridge? blower now.
6219,3,Not a thinker.
6220,3,"Man, I'm hungry, he thought."
6221,3,I hope Pablo eats well.
6222,3,CHAPTER TWOTHEY had come through the heavy timber to the cup-shaped upper end of the little valley and he saw where the camp must be under the rim-rock that rose ahead of them through the trees.
6223,3, That was the camp all right and it was a good camp.
6224,3,You did not see it at all until you were up to it and Robert Jordan knew it could not be spotted from the air.
6225,3,Nothi ng would show from above.
6226,3,It was as well hidden as a bear's den.
6227,3,But it seemed to be little better guarded.
6228,3,He looked at it carefully as they came up.
6229,3," There was a large cave in the rim-rock formation and beside the opening a man sat with his back against the rock, his legs stretched out on the ground and his carbine leaning against the rock."
6230,3,"He was cutting away on a stick with a knife and he stared at them as they came up, then went on whittling.""Hola, "" said the seated man."
6231,3,"""What is this that comes ?""   ""The old man and a dynamiter,"" Pablo told him and lowered the pack inside the entrance to the cave."
6232,3,"Anselmo lowered his pack, too, and Robert Jordan unslung the rifle and leaned it against the rock."
6233,3,"  ""Don't leave it so close to the cave,"" the whittling man, who had blue eyes in a dark, good-looking lazy gypsy face, the color of smoked leather, said."
6234,3,"""There's a fire in there.""  ""Get up and put it away thyself,"" Pablo said."
6235,3,""" Put it by that tree."" The gypsy did not move but said something unprintable, then, ""Leave it there."
6236,3,"Blow thyself up,"" he said lazily."
6237,3,"'' ' Twill cure thydiseases.""   ""What do you make ?"" Robert Jordan sat down by the gypsy."
6238,3,The gypsy showed him.
6239,3,It was a figure four trap and he was whittling the crossbar for it.
6240,3," ""For faxes ,"" he said."
6241,3,"""With a log for a dead-fall."
6242,3,"It breaks their backs."" He grinned at Jordan."
6243,3,"""Like this, see?"" He made a motion of the framework of the trap collapsing, the log falling, then shook his head, drew in his hand, and spread his arms to show the fox with a broken back."
6244,3,"""Very practical,"" he explained."
6245,3," "" He catches rabbits,"" Anselmo said."
6246,3,"""He is a gypsy."
6247,3,So if he catches rabbits he says it is faxes.
6248,3,"If he catches a fox he would say it was an elephant.""   ""And if I catch an elephant?"" the gypsy asked and showed his white teeth again and winked at Robert Jordan."" You'd say it was a tank,"" Anselmo told him."
6249,3," ''I'll get a tank,"" the gypsy told him."
6250,3,"""I will get a tank."
6251,3,"And you can say it is what you please."" ""Gypsies talk much and kill little,"" Anselmo told him.The gypsy winked at Robert Jordan and went on whittling."
6252,3, Pablo had gone in out of sight in the cave.
6253,3,Robert Jordan hoped he had gone for food.
6254,3,He sat on the ground by the gypsy and the afternoon sunlight came down through the tree tops and was warm on his outstretched legs.
6255,3,"He could smell food now in the cave, the smell of oil and of onions and of meat frying and his stomach moved with hunger inside of him."
6256,3," ""We can get a tank,"" he said to the gypsy."
6257,3,"""It is not too diffi? cult.""""With this ?"" the gypsy pointed toward the two sacks."
6258,3," "" Yes,"" Robert Jordan told him."
6259,3,"""I will teach you."
6260,3,You make a trap.
6261,3,"It is not too difficult."""" You and me ?"" ""Sure,"" said Robert Jordan."
6262,3,"""Why not?""   ""Hey,"" the gypsy said to Anselmo."
6263,3,"""Move those two sacks to where they will be safe, will you ? They're valuable.""  Anselmo grunted."
6264,3,"""I am going for wine,"" he told Robert Jor? dan."
6265,3,"Robert Jordan got up and lifted the sacks away from the cave entrance and leaned them, one on each side of a tree trunk."
6266,3,"He knew what was in them and he never liked to see them close to? gether.""Bring a cup for me,"" the gypsy told him."
6267,3," ""Is there wine ?"" Robert Jordan asked, sitting down again by the gypsy."" Wine? Why not? A whole skinful."
6268,3,"Half a skinful, anyway."" ""And what to eat?""""Everything, man,"" the gypsy said."
6269,3,"""We eat like generals."" ""And what do gypsies do in the war?"" Robert Jordan asked him."
6270,3,"""They keep on being gypsies.""""That's a good job."
6271,3,"""""The best,"" the gypsy said."
6272,3,"""How do they call thee?"" ""Roberto."
6273,3,"And thee?""""Rafael."
6274,3,"And this of the tank is serious?"" ""Surely."
6275,3,"Why not?""  Anselmo came out of the mouth of the cave with a deep stone basin full of red wine and with his fingers through the handles of three cups."
6276,3,"""Look,"" he said."
6277,3,"""They have cups and all."" Pablo came out behind them.""There is food soon,"" he said."
6278,3,"""Do you have tobacco?""  Robert Jordan went over to the packs and opening one, felt in? side an inner pocket and brought out one of the flat boxes of Russian cigarettes he had gotten at Golz's headquarters."
6279,3,"He ran his thumbnail around the edge of the box and, opening the lid, handed them to Pablo who took half a dozen."
6280,3,"Pablo, holding them in one of his huge hands, picked one up and looked at it against the light."
6281,3,They were long narrow cigarettes with paste? board cylinders for mouthpieces.
6282,3," ""Much air and little tobacco,"" he said."
6283,3,"""I know these."
6284,3,"The other with the rare name had them.""  ""Kashkin,"" Robert Jordan said and offered the cigarettes to the gypsy and Anselmo, who each took one."
6285,3," ""Take more,"" he said and they each took another."
6286,3,"He gave them each four more, they making a double nod with the hand holding the cigarettes so that the cigarette dipped its end as a man salutes with a sword, to thank him.""Yes,"" Pablo said."
6287,3,"""It was a rare name.""  ""Here is the wine."" Anselmo dipped a cup out of the bowl and handed it to Robert Jordan, then dipped for himselfand the gypsy."
6288,3," ""Is there no wine for me ?"" Pablo asked."
6289,3,They were all sitting together by the cave entrance.
6290,3, Anselmo handed him his cup and went into the cave for an? other.
6291,3,Coming out he leaned over the bowl and dipped the cup full and they all touched cup edges.
6292,3,"  The wine was good, tasting faintly resinous from the wineskin, but excellent, light and clean on his tongue."
6293,3,"Robert Jordan drank it slowly, feeling it spread warmly through his tiredness."
6294,3," ""The food comes shortly,"" Pablo said."
6295,3,"""And this foreigner with the rare name, how did he die?""""He was captured and he killed himself."" ""How did that happen ?"" ""He was wounded and he did not wish to be a prisoner."" ""What were the details ?""   ""I don't know,"" he lied."
6296,3,He knew the details very well and he knew they would not make good talking now.
6297,3," ""He made us promise to shoot him in case he were wounded at the business of the train and should be unable to get away,"" Pablo said."
6298,3,"""He spoke in a very rare manner.""  He must have been jumpy even then, Robert Jordan thought."
6299,3,Poor old Kashkin.
6300,3,"  ""He had a prejudice against killing himself,"" Pablo said."
6301,3,"""He told me that."
6302,3,"Also he had a great fear of being tortured."" ""Did he tell you that, too?"" Robert Jordan asked him."
6303,3,""" Yes,"" the gypsy said."
6304,3,"""He spoke like that to all of us."" ""Were you at the train, too?"" "" Yes."
6305,3,"All of us were at the train.""  ""He spoke in a very rare manner,"" Pablo said."
6306,3,"""But he was very brave.""  Poor old Kashkin, Robert Jordan thought."
6307,3,He must have been doing more harm than good around here.
6308,3,I wish I would have known he was that jumpy as far back as then.
6309,3,They should have pulled him out.
6310,3,You can't have people around doing this sort of work and talking like that.
6311,3,That is no way to talk.
6312,3,"Even if they accomplish their mission they are doing more harm than good, talking that sort of stuff."
6313,3," ""He was a little strange,"" Robert Jordan said."
6314,3,"""I think he was a little crazy.""  ""But very dexterous at producing explosions,"" the gypsy said."
6315,3,"""And very brave.""  ""But crazy,"" Robert Jordan said."
6316,3,"""In this you have to have very much head and be very cold in the head."
6317,3,"That was no way to talk.""  ""And you,"" Pablo said."
6318,3,"""If you are wounded in such a thing as this bridge, you would be willing to be left behind?""  ""Listen,"" Robert Jordan said and, leaning forward, he dipped himself another cup of the wine."
6319,3,"""Listen to me clearly."
6320,3,"If ever 1 should have any little favors to ask of any man, 1 will ask him at the time.""  ""Good,"" said the gypsy approvingly."
6321,3,"""In this way speak the good ones."
6322,3,"Ah ! Here it comes."""" You have eaten,"" said Pablo."
6323,3," ""And I can eat twice more,"" the gypsy told him."
6324,3,"""Look now who brings it.""  The girl stooped as she came out of the cave mouth carrying the big iron cooking platter and Robert Jordan saw her face turned at an  and at the same time saw the strange thing about her."
6325,3,"She smiled and said, aHola, Comrade,"" and Robert Jordan said, ""Sa iud, "" and was careful not to stare and not to look away."
6326,3,She set down the flat iron platter in front of him and he noticed her handsome brown hands.
6327,3,Now she looked him full in the face and smiled.
6328,3,Her teeth were white in her brown face and her skin and her eyes were the same golden tawny brown.
6329,3,"She had high cheek? bones, merry eyes and a straight mouth with full lips."
6330,3,Her hair was the golden brown of a grain field that has been burned dark in the sun but it was cut short all over her head so that it was but little longer than the fur on a beaver pelt.
6331,3,"She smiled in Robert Jordan's face and put her brown hand up and ran it over her head, flattening the hair which rose again as her hand passed."
6332,3,She has a beautiful facJ𠒯bert Jordan thought.
6333,3,She'd be beautiful if they hadn't cropped her hair.
6334,3," ""That is the way I comb it,"" she said to Robert Jordan and laughed."
6335,3,"""Go ahead and eat."
6336,3,Don't stare at me.
6337,3,They gave me this haircut in Valladolid.
6338,3,"It's almost grown out now.""  She sat down opposite him and looked at him."
6339,3,He looked back at her and she smiled and folded her hands together over her knees.
6340,3,Her legs slanted long and clean from the open cuffs of the trousers as she sat with her hands across her knees and he could see the shape of her small up-tilted breasts under the gray shirt.
6341,3,Every time Robert Jordan looked at her he could feel a thickness in his throat.
6342,3," ""There are no plates,"" Anselmo said."
6343,3,"""Use your own knife."" The girl had leaned four forks, tines down, against the sides of the iron dish."
6344,3," They were all eating out of the platter, not speaking, as is the Spanish custom."
6345,3,It was rabbit cooked with onions and green pep? pers and there were  chick  peas in the red wine  sauce.
6346,3," It waswell cooked, the rabbit meat flaked off the bones, and the sauce was delicious."
6347,3,Robert Jordan drank another cup of wine while he ate.
6348,3,The girl watched him all through the meal.
6349,3,Every one else was watching his food and eating.
6350,3,"Robert Jordan wiped up the last of the sauce in front of him with a piece of bread, piled the rabbit bones to one side, wiped the spot where they had been for sauce, then wiped his fork clean with the bread, wiped his knife and put it away and ate the bread."
6351,3,He leaned over and dipped his cup full of wine and the girl still watched him.
6352,3, Robert Jordan drank half the cup of wine but the thickness still came in his throat when he spoke to the girl.
6353,3,"  ""How art thou called ?"" he asked."
6354,3,Pablo looked at him quickly when he heard the tone of his voice.
6355,3,"Then he got up and walked away.""Maria."
6356,3,"And thee ?"" ""Roberto."
6357,3,"Have you been long in the mountains ?"" ""Three months.""   ""Three months ?"" He looked at her hai r, that was as thick and short and rippling when she passed her hand over it, now  em? barrassment, as a grain field in the wind on a hillside."
6358,3,"""It was shaved,"" she said."
6359,3,"""They shaved it regularly in the prison at Val? ladolid."
6360,3,It has taken three months to grow to this.
6361,3,I was on the train.
6362,3,They were taking me to the south.
6363,3,Many of the prisoners were caught after the train was blown up but I was not.
6364,3,"I came with these.""  ""I found her hidden in the rocks,"" the gypsy said."
6365,3,"""It was when we were leaving."
6366,3,"Man, but this one was ugly."
6367,3,"We took her along but many times I thought we would have to leave her.""   ""And the other one who was with them at the train?"" asked Maria."
6368,3,"""The other blond one."
6369,3,The foreigner.
6370,3,"Where is he ?"" ""Dead,"" Robert Jordan said."
6371,3,"""In April."" ""In April ? The train was in April."" "" Yes,"" Robert Jordan said."
6372,3,"""He died ten days after the train."" ""Poor man,"" she said."
6373,3,"""He was very brave."
6374,3,"And you do thatsame business ?"" "" Yes."""" You have done trains, too?"" "" Yes."
6375,3,"Three trains.""""Here?""   ""In Estremadura,"" he said."
6376,3,"""I was in Estremadura before I came here."
6377,3,We do very much in Estremadura.
6378,3,"There are many of us working in Estremadura.""""And why do you come to these mountains now?""   ""I take the place of the other blond one."
6379,3,"Also I know this coun? try from before the movement."""" You know it well ?""   ""No, not really well."
6380,3,But I learn fast.
6381,3,"I have a good map and I have a good guide.""""The old man,"" she nodded."
6382,3,"""The old man is very good."" ""Thank you,"" Anselmo said to her and Robert Jordan realizedsuddenly that he and the girl were not alone and he realized too that it was hard for him to look at her because it made his voice change so."
6383,3,"He was violating the second rule of the two rules for getting on well with people that speak Spanish; give the men to? bacco and leave the women alone; and he realized, very suddenly, that he did not care."
6384,3,"There were so many things that he had not to care about, why should he care about that?   "" You have a very beautiful face,"" he said to Maria."
6385,3,"""I wish I would have had the luck to see you before your hair was cut.""  ""It will grow out,"" she said."
6386,3,"""In six months it will be long enough.""   "" You should have seen her when we brought her from the train."
6387,3,"She was so ugly it would make you sick.""   ""Whose woman are you ?"" Robert Jordan asked, trying not to pull out of it."
6388,3,"""Are you Pablo's ?""   She looked at him and laughed, then slapped him on the knee.""Of Pablo? You have seen Pablo ?"" ""Well, then, of Rafael."
6389,3,"I have seen Rafael."" ""Of Rafael neither.""  ""Of no one,"" the gypsy said."
6390,3,"""This is a very strange woman."
6391,3,Is of no one.
6392,3,"But she cooks well."" ""Really of no one?"" Robert Jordan asked her."
6393,3," ""Of no one."
6394,3,No one.
6395,3,Neither in joke nor in seriousness.
6396,3,"Nor of thee either."" ""No?"" Robert Jordan said and he could feel the thickness com-ing in his throat again."
6397,3,"""Good."
6398,3,I have no time for any woman.
6399,3,"That is true.""  ""Not fifteen minutes ?"" the gypsy asked teasingly."
6400,3,"""Not a quar? ter of an hour?"" Robert Jordan did not answer."
6401,3,"He looked at the girl, Maria, and his throat felt too thick for him to trust himself to speak."
6402,3,"  Maria looked at him and laughed, then blushed suddenly but kept on looking at him."
6403,3," "" You are blushing,"" Robert Jordan said to her."
6404,3,"""Do you blush much?"" ""Never."""" You are blushing now."" ""Then I will go into the cave."" ""Stay here, Maria.""   ""No,"" she said and did not smile at him."
6405,3,"""I will go into the cave now."" She picked up the iron plate they had eaten from and the four forks."
6406,3,"She moved awkwardly as a colt moves, but with that same grace as of a young animal.""Do you want the cups ?"" she asked.Robert Jordan was still looking at her and she blushed again."
6407,3,"""Don't make me  do that,"" she said."
6408,3," ""I  do  not like to dothat.""  ""Leave them,"" they gypsy said to her."
6409,3,"""Here,"" he dipped into the stone bowl and handed the full cup to Robert Jordan who watched the girl duck her head and go into the cave carrying the heavy iron dish."
6410,3," ""Thank you,"" Robert Jordan said."
6411,3,"His voice was all right again, now that she was gone."
6412,3,"""This is the last one."
6413,3,"We've had enough of this.""   "" We will finish the bowl,"" the gypsy said."
6414,3,"""There is over half a skin."
6415,3,"We packed it in on one of the horses.""  ""That was the last raid of Pablo,"" Anselmo said."
6416,3,"""Since then he has done nothing.""""How many are you?"" Robert Jordan asked."
6417,3,"""We are seven and there are two women."" "" Two ?"" "" Yes."
6418,3,"The mujer of Pablo."" ""And she?""   ""In the cave."
6419,3,The girl can cook a little.
6420,3,I said she cooks well to please her.
6421,3,"But mostly she helps the mujer of Pablo.""""And how is she, the mujer of Pablo?""   ""Something barbarous,"" the gypsy grinned."
6422,3,"""Something very barbarous."
6423,3,If you think Pablo is ugly you should see his woman.
6424,3,But brave.
6425,3,A hundred times braver than Pablo.
6426,3,"But something barbarous.""  ""Pablo was brave in the beginning,"" Anselmo said."
6427,3,"""Pablo was something serious in the beginning.""  ""He killed more people than the cholera,"" the gypsy said."
6428,3,"""At the start of the movement, Pablo killed more people than the ty? phoid fever."
6429,3,"""""But since a long time he is muy flojo, Anselmo said."
6430,3,"""He is veryflaccid."
6431,3,"He is very much afraid to die.""   ""It is possible that it is because he has killed so many at the be? ginning,"" the gypsy said philosophically."
6432,3,"""Pablo killed more than the bubonic plague.""   ""That and the riches,"" Anselmo said."
6433,3,"""Also he drinks very much."
6434,3,Now he would like to retire like a matador de taros.
6435,3,Like a bullfighter.
6436,3,"But he cannot retire.""   ""If he crosses to the other side of the lines they will take his horses and make him go in the army,"" the gypsy said."
6437,3,"""In me  is no love for being in the army either."" ""Nor is there in any other gypsy,"" Anselmo said."
6438,3," ""Why should there be ?"" the gypsy asked."
6439,3,"""Who wants to be in an army ? Do we make the revolution to be in an army ? I am willing to fight but not to be in an army.""  ""Where are the others ?"" asked Robert Jordan."
6440,3,He felt comfort? able and sleepy now from the wine and lying back on the floor of the forest he saw through the tree tops the small afternoon clouds of the mountains moving slowly in the high Spanish sky.
6441,3," ""There are two asleep in the cave,"" the gypsy said."
6442,3,""" Two are on guard above where we have the gun."
6443,3,One is on guard below.
6444,3,"They are probably all asleep."" Robert Jordan rolled over on his side."
6445,3,"""What kind of a gun is it?""   ""A very rare name,"" the gypsy said."
6446,3,"""It has gone away from me for the moment."
6447,3,"It is a machine gun."" It must be an automatic rifle, Robert Jordan thought."
6448,3,"""How much does it weigh ?"" he asked."
6449,3," ""One man can carry it but it is heavy."
6450,3,It has three legs that fold.
6451,3,We got it in the last serious raid.
6452,3,"The one before the wine.""""How many rounds have you for it?""   ""An infinity,"" the gypsy said."
6453,3,"""One whole case of an unbeliev- able heaviness.""Sounds like about five hundred rounds, Robert Jordan thought."
6454,3,"""Does it feed from a pan or a belt ?"" ""From round i ron cans on the top of the gun."" Hell, it's a Lewis gun, Robert Jordan thought."
6455,3," ""Do you know anything about a machine gun ?"" he asked the old man."
6456,3,"""Nada, "" said Anselmo."
6457,3,"""Nothing.""""And thou ?"" to the gypsy."
6458,3," ""That they fire with much rapidity and become so hot the bar? rel burns the hand that touches it,"" the gypsy said proudly.""Every one knows that,"" Anselmo said with contempt."
6459,3,"""Perhaps,"" the gypsy said."
6460,3,"""But he asked me to tell what I knowabout a maquina and I told him."" Then he added, ""Also, unlike an ordinary rifle, they continue to fire as long as you exert pres? sure on the trigger.""  ""Unless they jam, run out of ammunition or get so hot they melt,"" Robert Jordan said in English.""What do you say?"" Anselmo asked him."
6461,3," ""Nothing,"" Robert Jordan said."
6462,3,"""I was only looking into the fu? ture in English.""  ""That is seomthing truly rare,"" the gypsy said."
6463,3,"""Looking into the future in Ingles."
6464,3,"Can you read in the palm of the hand P""   ""No,"" Robert Jordan said and he dipped another cup of wine."
6465,3,"""But if thou canst I wish thee would read in the palm of my hand and tell me what is going to pass in the next three days.""  ""The mujer of Pablo reads in the hands,"" the gypsy said."
6466,3,"""But she is so irritable and of such a barbarousness that I do not know if she will do it.""Robert Jordan sat up now and took a swallow of the wine."
6467,3," ""Let us see the mujer of Pablo now,"" he said."
6468,3,"""If it is that bad let us get it over with.""   ""I would not disturb her,"" Rafael said."
6469,3,"""She has a strong hatred for me.""""Why ?"" ""She treats me as a time waster."" ""What injustice,"" Anselmo taunted."
6470,3,"""She is against gypsies."" ""What an error,"" Anselmo said."
6471,3," ""She has gypsy blood,"" Rafael said."
6472,3,"""She knows of what she speaks."" He grinned."
6473,3,"""But she has a tongue that scalds and that bites like a bull whip."
6474,3,With this tongue she takes the hide from any one.
6475,3,In strips.
6476,3,"She is of an unbelievable barbarousness.""   ""How does she get along with the girl, Maria ?"" Robert Jordan asked."
6477,3," ""Good."
6478,3,She likes the girl.
6479,3,"But let any one come near her seri? ously-"" He shook his head and clucked with his tongue."
6480,3," ""She is very good with the girl,"" Anselmo said."
6481,3,"""She takes good care of her.""  ""When we picked the girl up at the time of the train she was very strange,"" Rafael said."
6482,3,"""She would not speak and she cried all the time and if any one touched her she would shiver like a wet dog."
6483,3,Only lately has she been better.
6484,3,Lately she has been much better.
6485,3,Today she was fine.
6486,3,"Just now, talking to you, she was very good."
6487,3,We would have left her after the train.
6488,3,Certainly it was not worth being delayed by something so sad and ugly and apparently worthless.
6489,3,"But the old woman tied a rope to her and when the girl thought she could not go further, the old woman beat her with the end of the rope to make her go."
6490,3,"Then when she could not really go further, the old woman carried her over her shoulder."
6491,3,"When the old woman could not carry her, I carried her."
6492,3,We were going up that hill breast high in the gorse and heather.
6493,3,"And when I could no longer carry her, Pablo carried her."
6494,3,"But what the old woman had to say to us to make us do it !"" He shook his head at the memory."
6495,3,"""It is true that the girl is long in the legs but is not heavy."
6496,3,The bones are light and she weighs little.
6497,3,"But she weighs enough when we had to carry her and stop to fire and then carry her again with the old woman lashing at Pablo with the rope and carrying his rifle, putting it in his hand when he would drop the girl, making him pick her up again andloading the gun for him while she cursed him; taking the shells from his pouches and shoving them down into the magazine and cursing him."
6498,3,The dusk was coming well on then and when the night came it was all right.
6499,3,"But it was lucky that they had no cavalry.""  ""It must have been very hard at the train,"" Anselmo said."
6500,3,"""I was not there,"" he explained to Robert Jordan."
6501,3,"""There was the band of Pablo, of EI Sardo, whom we will see tonight, and two other bands of these mountains."
6502,3,"I had gone to the other side of the lines.""  ""In addition to the blond one with the rare name-"" the gypsy said.""Kashkin.""   "" Yes."
6503,3,It is a name I can never dominate.
6504,3,We had two with a machine gun.
6505,3,They were sent also by the army.
6506,3,They could not get the gun away and lost it.
6507,3,"Certainly it weighed no more than that girl and if the old woman had been over them they would have gotten it away."" He shook his head remembering, then went on."
6508,3,"""Never in my life have I seen such a thing as when the explosion was produced."
6509,3,The train was coming steadily.
6510,3,We saw it far away.
6511,3,And I had an excitement so great that I cannot tell it.
6512,3,We saw steam from it and then later came the noise of the whistle.
6513,3,"Then it came chu-chu-chu-chu-chu-chu steadily larger and larger and then, at the moment of the explosion, the front wheels of the engine rose up and all of the earth seemed to rise in a great cloud of blackness and a roar and the engine rose high in the cloud of dirt and of the wooden ties rising in the air as in a dream and then it fell onto its side like a great wounded animal and there was an explosion of white steam before the clods of the other explosion had ceased to fall on us and the maquina com? menced to speak ta-tat-tat-ta !"" went the gypsy shaking his two clenched fists up and down in front of him, thumbs up, on an imaginary machine gun."
6514,3,""" Ta! Ta ! Tat! Tat! Tat! Ta !"" he exulted."
6515,3,"""Never in my li fe have I seen such a thing, with the troops run? ning from the train and the maquina speaking into them and the men falling."
6516,3,"It was then that I put my hand on the maquina in my excitement and discovered that the barrel burned and at that moment the old woman slapped me on the side of the face andsaid, 'Shoot, you fool ! Shoot or I will kick your brains in !' Then I commenced to shoot but it was very hard to hold my gun steady and the troops were running up the far hill."
6517,3,"Later, after we had been down at the train to see what there was to take, an officer forced some troops back toward us at the point of a pistol."
6518,3,He kept waving the pistol and shouting at them and we were all  at him but no one hit him.
6519,3,Then some troops lay down and commenced firing and the officer walked up and down be? hind them with his pistol and still we could not hit him and the maquina could  fire on him because of the position of the train.
6520,3,"This officer shot two men as they lay and still they would not get up  he was cursing them and finally they got up, one two and three at a time and came running toward us and the train."
6521,3,Then they lay flat again and fired.
6522,3,"Then we left, with the maquina still speaking over us as we left."
6523,3,It was then I found the girl where she had run from the train to the rocks and she ran with us.
6524,3,"It was those troops who hunted us until that night.""  ""It must have been something very hard,"" Anselmo said."
6525,3,"""Of much emotion.""   ""It was the only good thing we have done,"" said a deep voice."
6526,3,"""What are you doing now, you lazy drunken obscene unsayable son of an unnameable unmarried gypsy obscenity ? What are you doing?""   Robert Jordan saw a woman of about fifty almost as big as Pablo, almost as wide as she was tall, in black peasant skirt and waist, with heavy wool socks on heavy legs, black rope-soled shoes and a brown face like a model for a granite monument."
6527,3,She had big but nice looking hands and her thick curly black hair was twisted into a knot on her neck.
6528,3,"""Answer me,"" she said to the gypsy, ignoring the others."
6529,3,"""I was talking to these comrades."
6530,3,"This one comes as a dynamiter."" ""I know all that,"" the mujer of Pablo said."
6531,3,"""Get out of here nowand relieve Andres who is on guard at the top.""   ""Me voy, "" the gypsy said."
6532,3,"""I go."" He turned to Robert Jordan."
6533,3,"""I will see thee at the hour of eating.""  ""Not even in a joke,"" said the woman to him."
6534,3,"""Three times you have eaten today according to my count."
6535,3,"Go now and send me Andres.""Hola, "" she said to Robert Jordan and put out her hand andsmiled."
6536,3,"""How are you and how is everything in the Republic?"" ""Good,"" he said and returned her strong hand grip."
6537,3,"""Both withme and with the Republic.""   ""I am happy,"" she told him."
6538,3,She was looking into his face and smiling and he noticed she had fine gray eyes.
6539,3,"""Do you come for us to do another train ?"" ""No,"" said Robert Jordan, trusting her instantly."
6540,3,"""For a bridge.""   ""No es nada, "" she said."
6541,3,"""A bridge is nothing."
6542,3,"When do we do another train now that we have horses ?"" ""Later."
6543,3,"This bridge is of great importance.""   ""The girl told me your comrade who was with us at the	is dead."" "" Yes.""  ""What a pity."
6544,3,Never have I seen such an explosion.
6545,3,He was a man of talent.
6546,3,He pleased me very much.
6547,3,It is not possible to do another train now ? There are many men here now in  hills.
6548,3,Too many.
6549,3,It is already hard to get food.
6550,3,It would be better to get out.
6551,3,"And we have horses.""""We have to do this bridge."" ""Where is it ?"" ""Quite close.""   ""All the better,"" the mujer of Pablo said."
6552,3,"""Let us blow all the bridges there are here and get out."
6553,3,I am sick of this place.
6554,3,Here is too much concentration of people.
6555,3,No good can come of it.
6556,3,"Here is a stagnation that is repugnant.""She sighted Pablo through the trees."
6557,3," ""Borrachof"" she called to him."
6558,3,"""Drunkard."
6559,3,"Rotten drunkard !"" She turned back to Robert Jordan cheerfully."
6560,3,"""He's taken a leather wine bottle to drink alone in the woods,"" she said."
6561,3,"""He's drinking all the time."
6562,3,This li fe is  him.
6563,3,"Young man, I am very con? tent that you have come."" She clapped him on the back."
6564,3,"""Ah,"" she said."
6565,3,""" You're bigger than you look,"" and ran her hand over his shoulder, feeling the muscle under the flannel shirt."
6566,3,"""Good."
6567,3,"I am very content that you have come."" ""And I equally."
6568,3,"""  ""We will understand each other,"" she said."
6569,3,"""Have a cup of wine.""  ""We have already had some,"" Robert Jordan said."
6570,3,"""But, will you?""   ""Not until dinner,"" she said."
6571,3,"""It gives me heartburn."" Then she sighted Pablo again."
6572,3,"""Borracho!"" she shouted."
6573,3,"""Drunkard !"" She turned to Robert Jordan and shook her head."
6574,3,"""He was a very good man,"" she told him."
6575,3,"""But now he is terminated."
6576,3,And listen to me about another thing.
6577,3,Be very good and careful about the girl.
6578,3,The Maria.
6579,3,She has had a bad time.
6580,3,"Understandest thou ?"" "" Yes."
6581,3,"Why do you say this ?""   ""I saw how she was from seeing thee when she came into the cave."
6582,3,"I saw her watching thee before she came out.""""I joked with her a little.""   ""She was in a very bad state,"" the woman of Pablo said."
6583,3,"""Now she is better, she ought to get out of here."" ""Clearly, she can be sent through the lines with Anselmo."" "" You and the Anselmo can take her when this terminates.""   Robert Jordan felt the ache in his throat and his voice thicken- ing."
6584,3,"""That might be done,"" he said.The m ujer of Pablo looked at him and shook her head."
6585,3,"""Ayee.Ayec,"" she said."
6586,3,"""Are all men like that?"" ""I said nothing."
6587,3,"She is beautiful, you know that.""  ""No she is not beautiful."
6588,3,"But she begins to be beautiful, you mean,"" the woman of Pablo said."
6589,3,"""Men."
6590,3,It is a shame to us women that we make them.
6591,3,No.
6592,3,In seriousness.
6593,3,"Are there not homes to care for such as her under the Republic?""   "" Yes,"" said Robert Jordan."
6594,3,"""Good places."
6595,3,On the coast near Va? lencia.
6596,3,In other places too.
6597,3,There they will treat her well and she can work with children.
6598,3,There are the children from evacuated villages.
6599,3,"They will teach her the work.""   ""That is what I want,"" the mujer of Pablo said."
6600,3,"""Pablo has a sickness for her already."
6601,3,It is another thing which destroys him.
6602,3,It lies on him like a sickness when he sees her.
6603,3,"It is best that she goes now.""""We can take her after this is over.""   ""And you will be careful of her now if I trust you ? I speak to you as though I knew you for a long time.""  ""It is like that,"" Robert Jordan said, ""when people understand  another.""   ""Sit down,"" the woman of Pablo said."
6604,3,"""I do not ask any promise because what will happen, will happen."
6605,3,"Only if you will not take her out, then I ask a promise.""""Why if I would not take her?""   ""Because I do not want her crazy here after you will go."
6606,3,"I have had her crazy before and I have enough without that.""  ""We will take her after the bridge,"" Robert Jordan said."
6607,3,"""If we are alive after the bridge, we will take her.""   ""I do not like to hear you speak in that manner."
6608,3,"That  of speaking never brings luck.""   ""I spoke in that manner only to make a promise,"" Robert Jor? dan said."
6609,3,"""I am not of those who speak gloomily.""  ""Let me see thy hand,"" the woman said."
6610,3,"Robert Jordan put his hand out and the woman opened it, held it in her own big hand, rubbed her thumb over it and looked at it, carefully, then dropped it."
6611,3,She stood up.
6612,3,He got up too and she looked at him without smiling.
6613,3," ""What did you see in it? "" Robert Jordan asked her."
6614,3,"""I don't be- lieve in it."
6615,3,"You won't scare me.""""Nothing,"" she told him."
6616,3,"""I saw nothing in it."" ""Yes you did."
6617,3,I am only curious.
6618,3,"I do not believe in such things."" ""In what do you believe ?"" ""In many things but not in that."" ""In what?"" ""In my work."" "" Yes, I saw that."""" Tell me what else you saw.""  ""I saw nothing else,"" she said bitterly."
6619,3,"""The bridge is very di ffi- cult you said ?"" ""No."
6620,3,"I said it is very important."" ""But it can be difficult?""   "" Yes."
6621,3,And now I go down to look at it.
6622,3,"How many men have you here ?""   ""Five that are any good."
6623,3,The gypsy is worthless although his in? tentions are good.
6624,3,He has a good heart.
6625,3,"Pablo I no longer trust.""""How many men has El Sordo that are good ?""   ""Perhaps eight."
6626,3,We will see tonight.
6627,3,He is coming here.
6628,3,He is a very practical man.
6629,3,He also has some dynamite.
6630,3,"Not very much, though."
6631,3,"You will speak with him."" ""Have you sent for him ?""   ""He comes every night."
6632,3,He is a neighbor.
6633,3,"Also a friend as well as a comrade.""34	E r n e s t  H e m i n g w a y""What do you think of him ?""   ""He is a very good man."
6634,3,Also very practical.
6635,3,"In the business of the train he was enormous."" ""And in the other bands ?""   ""Advising them in time, it should be possible to unite fifty rifles of a certain dependability.""""How dependable ?"" ""Dependable within the gravity of the situation."" ""And how many cartridges per rifle ?""   ""Perhaps twenty."
6636,3,Depending how many they would bring for this busmess.
6637,3,If they would come for this business.
6638,3,"Remember thee that in this of a bridge there is no money and no loot and in thy reservations of talking, much danger, and that afterwards there must be a moving from these mountains."
6639,3,"Many will oppose this of the bridge."" ""Clearly.""""In this way it is better not to speak of it unnecessarily."" ""I am in accord.""   ""Then after thou hast studied thy bridge we will talk tonight with El Sordo."" ""I go down now with Anselmo."" ""Wake him then,"" she said."
6640,3,"""Do you want a carbine ?""   ""Thank you,"" he told her."
6641,3,"""It is good to have but I will not use it."
6642,3,"I go to look, not to make disturbances."
6643,3,Thank you for what you have told me.
6644,3,"I like very much your way of speaking.""""I try to speak frankly.""""Then tell me what you saw in the hand.""  ""No,"" she said and shook her head."
6645,3,"""I saw nothing."
6646,3,Go now to thy bridge.
6647,3,"I will look after thy equipment.""  ""Cover it and that no one should touch it."
6648,3,"It is better there than in the cave.""   ""It shall be covered and no one shall touch it,"" the woman of Pablo said."
6649,3,"""Go now to thy bridge.""   ""Anselmo,"" Robert Jordan said, putting his hand on the shoul? der of the old man who lay sleeping, his head on his arms.The old man looked up."
6650,3,"""Yes,"" he said."
6651,3,"""Of course."
6652,3,"Let us go."" CHAPTER THREETHEY came down the last two hundred yards, moving carefully from tree to tree in the shadows and now, through the last pines of the steep hillside, the bridge was only fifty yards away."
6653,3,The late afternoon sun that still came over the brown shoulder of the mountain showed the bridge dark against the steep emptiness of the gorge.
6654,3,It was a steel bridge of a single span and there was a sentry box at each end.
6655,3,"It was wide enough for two motor cars to pass and it spanned, in solid- flung metal grace, a deep gorge at the bottom of which, far below, a brook leaped in white water through rocks and boulders down to the main stream of the pass."
6656,3, The sun was in Robert Jordan's eyes and the bridge showed only in outline.
6657,3,"Then the sun lessened and was gone and looking up through the trees at the brown, rounded height that it had gone behind, he saw, now, that he no longer looked into the glare, that the mountain slope was a delicate new green and that there were patches of old snow under the crest."
6658,3," Then he was watching the bridge again in the sudden short trueness of the little light that would be left, and studying its con? struction."
6659,3,The problem of its demolition was not di fficult.
6660,3,As he watched he took out a notebook from his breast pocket and made several quick line sketches.
6661,3,As he made the drawings he did not figure the charges.
6662,3,He would do that later.
6663,3,Now he was noting the points where the explosive should be placed in order to cut the support of the span and drop a section of it into the gorge.
6664,3,"It could be done unhurriedly, scientifically and correctly with a half dozen charges laid and braced to explode simultaneously; or it could be done roughly with two big ones."
6665,3,"They would need to be very big ones, on opposite sides and should go at the same time."
6666,3,He sketched quickly and happily; glad at last to have the problem under his hand; glad at last actually to be engaged upon it.
6667,3,"Thenhe shut his notebook, pushed the pencil into its leather holder in the edge of the flap, put the notebook in his pocket and buttoned the pocket."
6668,3," While he had sketched, Anselmo had been watching the road, the bridge and the sentry boxes."
6669,3,"He thought they had come too close to the bridge for safety and when the sketching was finished, he was relieved."
6670,3," As Robert Jordan buttoned the flap of his pocket and then lay flat behind the pine trunk, looking out from behind it, Anselmo put his hand on his elbow and pointed with one finger."
6671,3," In the sentry box that faced toward them up the road, the sentry was sitting holding his rifle, the bayonet fixed, between his knees."
6672,3,He was smoking a cigarette and he wore a knitted cap and blanket style cape.
6673,3,"At fifty yards, you could not see anything about his face."
6674,3,"Robert  put up his field glasses, shading the lenses carefully with his cupped hands even though there was now no sun to make a glint, and there was the rail of the bridge as clear as though you could reach out and touch it and there was the face of the sentry so clear he could see the sunken cheeks, the ash on the cigarette and the greasy shine of the bayonet."
6675,3,"It was a peasant's face, the cheeks hollow under the high cheekbones, the beard stubbled, the eyes shaded by the heavy brows, big hands holding the rifle, heavy boots showing beneath the folds of the blanket cape."
6676,3,"There was a worn, blackened leather wine bottle on the wall of the sentry box, there were some newspapers and there was no telephone."
6677,3,"There could, of course, be a telephone on the side he could not see; but there were no wires running from the box that were visible."
6678,3,A telephone line ran along the road and its wires were carried over the bridge.
6679,3,"There was a charcoal brazier outside the  box, made from an old petrol tin with the top cut off and holes punched in it, which rested on two stones; but he held no fire."
6680,3,There were some fire-blackened empty tins in the ashes under it.
6681,3, Robert Jordan handed the glasses to Anselmo who lay flat be? side him.
6682,3,The old man grinned and shook his head.
6683,3,"He tapped his skull beside his eye with one finger.""Ya io veo, "" he said in Spanish."
6684,3,"""I have seen him,"" speaking from the front of his mouth with almost no movement of his lips in the way that is quieter than any whisper."
6685,3,"He looked at the sentry as Robert Jordan smiled at him and, pointing with one finger, drew the other across his throat."
6686,3,Robert Jordan nodded but he did not smile.
6687,3, The sentry box at the far end of the bridge faced away from them and down the road and they could not see into it.
6688,3,"The road, which was broad and oiled and well constructed, made a turn to the left at the far end of the bridge and then swung out of sight around a curve to the right."
6689,3,"At this point it was enlarged from the old road to its present width by cutting into the solid bastion of the rock on the far side of the gorge; and its left or western edge, looking down from the pass and the bridge, was marked and protected by a line of upright cut blocks of stone where its edge fell sheer away to the gorge."
6690,3,"The gorge was almost a canyon here, where the brook, that the bridge was flung over, merged with the main stream of the pass.""And the other post ?"" Robert Jordan asked Anselmo."
6691,3," ""Five hundred meters below that turn."
6692,3,"In the roadmender's hut that is built into the side of the rock."" ""How many men?"" Robert Jordan asked."
6693,3, He was watching the sentry again with his glasses.
6694,3,"The sentry rubbed his cigarette out on the plank wall of the box, then took a leather tobacco pouch from his  pocket, opened the paper of the dead cigarette and emptied the remnant of used tobacco into the pouch."
6695,3,"The sentry stood up, leaned his rifle against the wall of the box and stretched,  picked up his rifle, slung it over his shoulder and walked out onto the bridge."
6696,3,Anselmo flattened on the ground and Robert Jordan slipped his glasses into his shirt pocket and put his head well behind the pine tree.
6697,3," ""There are seven men and a corporal,"" Anselmo said close to his ear."
6698,3,"""I informed myself from the gypsy.""  ""We will go now as soon as he is quiet,"" Robert Jordan said."
6699,3,"""We are too close."" ""Hast thou seen what thou needest?"" "" Yes."
6700,3,"All that I need.""   It was getting cold quickly now with the sun down and the light was failing as the afterglow from the last sunlight on the mountains behind them faded.""How does it look to thee ?"" Anselmo said softly as they watchedthe sentry walk across the bridge toward the other box, his bayonet bright in the last of the a fterglow, his figure unshapely in the blan? ket coat."" Very good,"" Robert Jordan said."
6701,3,""" Very, very good.""   ""I am glad,"" Anselmo said."
6702,3,"""Should we go? Now there is no chance that he sees us.""  The sentry was standing, his back toward them, at the far end of the bridge."
6703,3,From the gorge came the noise of the stream in the boulders.
6704,3,"Then through this noise came another noise, a steady, racketing drone and they saw the sentry looking up, his knitted cap slanted back, and turning their heads and looking up they saw, high in the evening sky, three monoplanes in V formation, showing minute and silvery at that height where there still was sun, passing unbelievably quickly across the sky, their motors now throbbing steadily.""Ours ?"" Anselmo asked."
6705,3," ""They seem so,"" Robert Jordan said but knew that at that height you never could be sure."
6706,3,They could be an evening patrol of either side.
6707,3,But you always said pursuit planes were ours be? cause it made people feel better.
6708,3,Bombers were another matter.
6709,3, Anselmo evidently felt the same.
6710,3,"""They are ours,"" he said."
6711,3,"""I recognize them."
6712,3,They are Moscas.
6713,3,"""""Good,"" said Robert Jordan."
6714,3,"""They seem to me to be Moscas,too."" ""They are Moscas, "" Anselmo said."
6715,3, Robert could have put the glasses on them and been sure instantly but he preferred not to.
6716,3,"It made no difference to him who they were tonight and if it pleased the old man to have them be ours, he did not want to take them away."
6717,3,"Now, as they moved out of sight toward Segovia, they did not look to be the green, red wing-tipped, low wing Russian conversion ."
6718,3,He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish.
6719,3,In the first forty days a boy had been with him.
6720,3,"But after forty days without a fish the boyճ parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in anotherboat which caught three good fish the first week."
6721,3,It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast.
6722,3,"The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck."
6723,3,The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks.
6724,3,The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords.
6725,3,But none of these scars were fresh.
6726,3,"They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.ғantiago,Ӡthe boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was hauled up."
6727,3,҉ could go with you again.
6728,3,"Weնe made some money.ӍThe old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.Ҏo,Ӡthe old man said."
6729,3,ҙouղe with a lucky boat.
6730,3,Stay with them.
6731,3,"Ӎ҂ut remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big ones every day for three weeks.Ӎ҉ remember,Ӡthe old man said."
6732,3,҉ know you did not leave me because you doubted.Ӎ҉t was papa made me leave.
6733,3,"I am a boy and I must obey him.Ӡ҉ know,Ӡthe old man said."
6734,3,"҉t is quite normal.Ӎ҈e hasnմ much faith.ӍҎo,Ӡthe old man said."
6735,3,҂ut we have.
6736,3,"Havenմ we?Ӎҙes,Ӡthe boy said."
6737,3,҃an I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then weլl take the stuff home.Ӎҗhy not?Ӡthe old man said.
6738,3,҂etween fishermen.ӍThey sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was not angry.
6739,3,"Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad."
6740,3,But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen.
6741,3,"The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana."
6742,3,"Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark factory; but today there was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.ғantiago,Ӡthe boy said.ҙes,Ӡthe old man said."
6743,3,He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.҃an I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?ӍҎo.
6744,3,Go and play baseball.
6745,3,I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net.Ӎ҉ would like to go.
6746,3,If I cannot fish with you.
6747,3,"I would like to serve in some way.Ӎҙou bought me a beer,Ӡthe old man said."
6748,3,ҙou are already a man.Ӎ҈ow old was I when you first took me in a boat?Ӎ҆ive and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly tore the boat to pieces.
6749,3,Can you remember?Ӎ҉ can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the noise of the clubbing.
6750,3,"I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me.Ӎ҃an you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?Ӡ҉ remember everything from when we first went together.ӍThe old man looked at him with his sun-burned, confident loving eyes.҉f you were my boy Iդ take you out and gamble,Ӡhe said."
6751,3,҂ut you are your fatherճ and your motherճ and you are in a lucky boat.Ӎҍay I get the sardines? I know where I can get four baits too.Ӡ҉ have mine left from today.
6752,3,"I put them in salt in the box.ӍҌet me get four fresh ones.Ӎҏne,Ӡthe old man said."
6753,3,His hope and his confidence had never gone.
6754,3,"But now they were freshening as when the breeze rises.Ҕwo,Ӡthe boy said.Ҕwo,Ӡthe old man agreed."
6755,3,"ҙou didnմ steal them?Ӡ҉ would,Ӡthe boy said."
6756,3,"҂ut I bought these.ӍҔhank you,Ӡthe old man said."
6757,3,He was too simple to wonder when he had attained humility.
6758,3,"But he knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it carried no loss of true pride.Ҕomorrow is going to be a good day with this current,Ӡhe said."
6759,3,җhere are you going?Ӡthe boy asked.҆ar out to come in when the wind shifts.
6760,3,"I want to be out before it is light.Ӎ҉լl try to get him to work far out,Ӡthe boy said."
6761,3,"Ҕhen if you hook something truly big we can come to your aid.Ӎ҈e does not like to work too far out.ӍҎo,Ӡthe boy said."
6762,3,"҂ut I will see something that he cannot see such as a bird working and get him to come out after dolphin.Ӎҁre his eyes that bad?Ӡ҈e is almost blind.Ӎ҉t is strange,Ӡthe old man said."
6763,3,҈e never went turtle-ing.
6764,3,That is what kills the eyes.Ӎ҂ut you went turtle-ing for years off the Mosquito Coast and your eyes are good.Ӎ҉ am a strange old manӍ҂ut are you strong enough now for a truly big fish?Ӡ҉ think so.
6765,3,"And there are many tricks.ӍҌet us take the stuff home,Ӡthe boy said."
6766,3,ғo I can get the cast net and go after the sardines.ӍThey picked up the gear from the boat.
6767,3,"The old man carried the mast on his shoulder and the boy carried the wooden boat with the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff and the harpoon with its shaft."
6768,3,The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish when they were brought alongside.
6769,3,"No one would steal from theold man but it was better to take the sail and the heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, though he was quite sure no local people would steal from him, the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were needless temptations to leave in a boat.They walked up the road together to the old manճ shack and went in through its open door."
6770,3,The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the boy put the box and the other gear beside it.
6771,3,The mast was nearly as long as the one room of the shack.
6772,3,"The shack was made of the tough budshields of the royal palm which are called guano and in it there was a bed, a table, one chair, and a place on the dirt floor to cook with charcoal."
6773,3,"On the brown walls of the flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy fibered guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another of the Virgin of Cobre."
6774,3,These were relics of his wife.
6775,3,Once there had been a tinted photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too lonely to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt.җhat do you have to eat?Ӡthe boy asked.ҁ pot of yellow rice with fish.
6776,3,Do you want some?ӍҎo.
6777,3,I will eat at home.
6778,3,Do you want me to make the fire?ӠҎo.
6779,3,I will make it later on.
6780,3,Or I may eat the rice cold.Ӡҍay I take the cast net?Ӎҏf course.ӍThere was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it.
6781,3,But they went through this fiction every day.
6782,3,"There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this too.҅ighty-five is a lucky number,Ӡthe old man said."
6783,3,҈ow would you like to see me bring one in that dressed out over a thousand pounds?Ӎ҉լl get the cast net and go for sardines.
6784,3,Will you sit in the sun in the doorway?Ӎҙes.
6785,3,I have yesterdayճ paper and I will read the baseball.ӍThe boy did not know whether yesterdayճ paper was a fiction too.
6786,3,"But the old man brought it out from under the bed.Ґerico gave it to me at the bodega,Ӡhe explained.҉լl be back when I have the sardines."
6787,3,Iլl keep yours and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning.
6788,3,When I come back you can tell me about the baseball.ӍҔhe Yankees cannot lose.Ӎ҂ut I fear the Indians of Cleveland.Ӎ҈ave faith in the Yankees my son.
6789,3,Think of the great DiMaggio.
6790,3,"Ӎ҉ fear both the Tigers of Detroit and the Indians of Cleveland.Ӎ҂e careful or you will fear even the Reds of Cincinnati and the White Sox of Chicago.Ӎҙou study it and tell me when I come back.Ӎ҄o you think we should buy a terminal of the lottery with an eighty-five? Tomorrow is the eighty-fifth day.Ӎҗe can do that,Ӡthe boy said."
6791,3,҂ut what about the eighty-seven of your great record?Ӎ҉t could not happen twice.
6792,3,Do you think you can find an eighty- five?Ӎ҉ can order one.ҏne sheet.
6793,3,Thatճ two dollars and a half.
6794,3,Who can we borrow that from?ӍҔhatճ easy.
6795,3,I can always borrow two dollars and a half.Ӎ҉ think perhaps I can too.
6796,3,But I try not to borrow.
6797,3,First you borrow.
6798,3,"Then you beg.Ӎҋeep warm old man,Ӡthe boy said."
6799,3,"Ғemember we are in September.ӍҔhe month when the great fish come,Ӡthe old man said."
6800,3,"ҁnyone can be a fisherman in May.Ӎ҉ go now for the sardines,Ӡthe boy said.When the boy came back the old man was asleep in the chair and the sun was down."
6801,3,The boy took the old army blanket off the bed and spread it over the back of the chair and over the old manճ shoulders.
6802,3,"They were strange shoulders, still powerfulalthough very old, and the neck was still strong too and the creases did not show so much when the old man was asleep and his head fallen forward."
6803,3,His shirt had been patched so many times that it was like the sail and the patches were faded to many different shades by the sun.
6804,3,The old manճ head was very old though and with his eyes closed there was no life in his face.
6805,3,The newspaper lay across his knees and the weight of his arm held it there in the evening breeze.
6806,3,"He was barefooted.The boy left him there and when he came back the old man was still asleep.җake up old man,Ӡthe boy said and put his hand on one of the old manճ knees.The old man opened his eyes and for a moment he was coming back from a long way away."
6807,3,"Then he smiled.җhat have you got?Ӡhe asked.ғupper,Ӡsaid the boy."
6808,3,җeղe going to have supper.Ӡ҉խ not very hungry.Ӎ҃ome on and eat.
6809,3,"You canմ fish and not eat.Ӎ҉ have,Ӡthe old man said getting up and taking the newspaper and folding it."
6810,3,"Then he started to fold the blanket.ҋeep the blanket around you,Ӡthe boy said."
6811,3,"ҙouլl not fish without eating while Iխ alive.ӍҔhen live a long time and take care of yourself,Ӡthe old mansaid."
6812,3,"җhat are we eating?Ӎ҂lack beans and rice, fried bananas, and some stew.ӍThe boy had brought them in a two-decker metal container from the Terrace."
6813,3,The two sets of knives and forks and spoons were in his pocket with a paper napkin wrapped around each set.җho gave this to you?Ӡҍartin.
6814,3,"The owner.Ӡ҉ must thank him.Ӎ҉ thanked him already,Ӡthe boy said."
6815,3,"ҙou donմ need to thank him.Ӎ҉լl give him the belly meat of a big fish,Ӡthe old man said."
6816,3,҈as he done this for us more than once?Ӎ҉ think so.Ӎ҉ must give him something more than the belly meat then.
6817,3,He is very thoughtful for us.Ӎ҈e sent two beers.Ӎ҉ like the beer in cans best.Ӎ҉ know.
6818,3,"But this is in bottles, Hatuey beer, and I take back the bottles.ӍҔhatճ very kind of you,Ӡthe old man said."
6819,3,"ғhould we eat?Ӎ҉նe been asking you to,Ӡthe boy told him gently."
6820,3,"҉ have not wished to open the container until you were ready.Ӎ҉խ ready now,Ӡthe old man said."
6821,3,҉ only needed time to wash.ӍWhere did you wash? the boy thought.
6822,3,The village water supply was two streets down the road.
6823,3,"I must have water here for him, the boy thought, and soap and a good towel."
6824,3,"Why am I so thoughtless? I must get him another shirt and a jacket for the winter and some sort of shoes and another blanket.ҙour stew is excellent,Ӡthe old man said.Ҕell me about the baseball,Ӡthe boy asked him.҉n the American League it is the Yankees as I said,Ӡthe old man said happily.ӍҔhey lost today,Ӡthe boy told him.Ҕhat means nothing."
6825,3,The great DiMaggio is himself again.ӠҔhey have other men on the team.ӍҎaturally.
6826,3,But he makes the difference.
6827,3,"In the other league, between Brooklyn and Philadelphia I must take Brooklyn."
6828,3,But then I think of Dick Sisler and those great drives in the old park.ӍҔhere was nothing ever like them.
6829,3,He hits the longest ball I have ever seen.Ӎ҄o you remember when he used to come to the Terrace? I wanted to take him fishing but I was too timid to ask him.
6830,3,Then Iasked you to ask him and you were too timid.Ӎ҉ know.
6831,3,It was a great mistake.
6832,3,He might have gone with us.
6833,3,"Then we would have that for all of our lives.Ӎ҉ would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing,Ӡthe old man said."
6834,3,Ҕhey say his father was a fisherman.
6835,3,"Maybe he was as poor as we are and would understand.ӍҔhe great Sislerճ father was never poor and he, the father, was playing in the Big Leagues when he was my age.Ӎҗhen I was your age I was before the mast on a square rigged ship that ran to Africa and I have seen lions on the beaches in the evening.Ӎ҉ know."
6836,3,"You told me.Ӎғhould we talk about Africa or about baseball?Ӎ҂aseball I think,Ӡthe boy said."
6837,3,Ҕell me about the great John J.
6838,3,McGraw.ӠHe said Jota for J.҈e used to come to the Terrace sometimes too in the older days.
6839,3,But he was rough and harsh-spoken and difficult when he was drinking.
6840,3,His mind was on horses as well as baseball.
6841,3,"At least he carried lists of horses at all times in his pocket and frequently spoke the names of horses on the telephone.Ӎ҈e was a great manager,Ӡthe boy said."
6842,3,"ҍy father thinks he was the greatest.Ӎ҂ecause he came here the most times,Ӡthe old man said."
6843,3,"҉fDurocher had continued to come here each year your father would think him the greatest manager.Ӎҗho is the greatest manager, really, Luque or Mike Gonzalez?Ӡ҉ think they are equal.Ӎҁnd the best fisherman is you.ӠҎo."
6844,3,"I know others better.Ӎґu va,Ӡthe boy said."
6845,3,Ҕhere are many good fishermen and some great ones.
6846,3,But there is only you.ӍҔhank you.
6847,3,You make me happy.
6848,3,"I hope no fish will come along so great that he will prove us wrong.ӍҔhere is no such fish if you are still strong as you say.Ӎ҉ may not be as strong as I think,Ӡthe old man said."
6849,3,҂ut I know many tricks and I have resolution.Ӎҙou ought to go to bed now so that you will be fresh in the morning.
6850,3,I will take the things back to the Terrace.Ӎ҇ood night then.
6851,3,"I will wake you in the morning.Ӡҙouղe my alarm clock,Ӡthe boy said.ҁge is my alarm clock,Ӡthe old man said."
6852,3,"җhy do old men wake so early? Is it to have one longer day?Ӎ҉ donմ know,Ӡthe boy said."
6853,3,"ҁll I know is that young boys sleeplate and hard.Ӎ҉ can remember it,Ӡthe old man said."
6854,3,҉լl waken you in time.Ӡ҉ do not like for him to waken me.
6855,3,It is as though I were inferior.Ӡ҉ know.Ӎғleep well old man.ӍThe boy went out.
6856,3,They had eaten with no light on the table and the old man took off his trousers and went to bed in the dark.
6857,3,"He rolled his trousers up to make a pillow, putting the newspaper inside them."
6858,3,"He rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers that covered the springs of the bed.He was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of Africa when he was a boy and the long golden beaches and the white beaches, so white they hurt your eyes, and the high capes and the great brown mountains."
6859,3,He lived along that coast now every night and in his dreams he heard the surf roar and saw the native boats come riding through it.
6860,3,He smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he slept and he smelled the smell of Africa that the land breeze brought at morning.Usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and wake the boy.
6861,3,"But tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early and he knew it was too early in his dream and went on dreaming to see the white peaks of the Islands rising from the sea and then he dreamed of the different harbours and roadsteads of the Canary Islands.He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of greatoccurrences, nor of great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife."
6862,3,He only dreamed of places now and of the lions on the beach.
6863,3,They played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them as he loved the boy.
6864,3,He never dreamed about the boy.
6865,3,"He simply woke, looked out the open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers and put them on."
6866,3,He urinated outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the boy.
6867,3,He was shivering with the morning cold.
6868,3,But he knew he would shiver himself warm and that soon he would be rowing.The door of the house where the boy lived was unlocked and he opened it and walked in quietly with his bare feet.
6869,3,The boy was asleep on a cot in the first room and the old man could see him clearly with the light that came in from the dying moon.
6870,3,He took hold of one foot gently and held it until the boy woke and turned and looked at him.
6871,3,"The old man nodded and the boy took his trousers from the chair by the bed and, sitting on the bed, pulled them on.The old man went out the door and the boy came after him."
6872,3,"He was sleepy and the old man put his arm across his shoulders and said, ҉ am sorry.Ӎґu va,Ӡthe boy said."
6873,3,"҉t is what a man must do.ӍThey walked down the road to the old manճ shack and all along the road, in the dark, barefoot men were moving, carrying the masts of their boats.When they reached the old manճ shack the boy took the rolls of line in the basket and the harpoon and gaff and the old man carried the mast with the furled sail on his shoulder.҄o you want coffee?Ӡthe boy asked.җeլl put the gear in the boat and then get some.ӍThey had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served fishermen.҈ow did you sleep old man?Ӡthe boy asked."
6874,3,"He was waking up now although it was still hard for him to leave his sleep.Җery well, Manolin,Ӡthe old man said."
6875,3,"҉ feel confident today.Ӎғo do I,Ӡthe boy said."
6876,3,Ҏow I must get your sardines and mine and your fresh baits.
6877,3,He brings our gear himself.
6878,3,"He never wants anyone to carry anything.Ӎҗeղe different,Ӡthe old man said."
6879,3,"҉ let you carry things when you were five years old.Ӎ҉ know it,Ӡthe boy said."
6880,3,҉լl be right back.
6881,3,Have another coffee.
6882,3,"We have credit here.ӍHe walked off, bare-footed on the coral rocks, to the ice house where the baits were stored.The old man drank his coffee slowly."
6883,3,It was all he would have all day and he knew that he should take it.
6884,3,For a long time now eating had bored him and he never carried a lunch.
6885,3,"He had a bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the day.The boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper and they went down the trail to theskiff, feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and lifted the skiff and slid her into the water.҇ood luck old man.Ӎ҇ood luck,Ӡthe old man said."
6886,3,"He fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole pins and, leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water, he began to row out of the harbour in the dark."
6887,3,There were other boats from the other beaches going out to sea and the old man heard the dip and push of their oars even though he could not see them now the moon was below the hills.Sometimes someone would speak in a boat.
6888,3,But most of the boats were silent except for the dip of the oars.
6889,3,They spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbour and each one headed for the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish.
6890,3,The old man knew he was going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the clean early morning smell of the ocean.
6891,3,He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf weed in the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep walls of the floor of the ocean.
6892,3,Here there were concentrations of shrimp and bait fish and sometimes schools of squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the wandering fish fed on them.In the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made as they soaredaway in the darkness.
6893,3,He was very fond of flying fish as they were his principal friends on the ocean.
6894,3,"He was sorry for the birds, especially the small delicate dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost never finding, and he thought, the birds have a harder life than we do except for the robber birds and the heavy strong ones."
6895,3,Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean can be so cruel? She is kind and very beautiful.
6896,3,"But she can be so cruel and it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are made too delicately for the sea.He always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in Spanish when they love her."
6897,3,Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always said as though she were a woman.
6898,3,"Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had motorboats, bought when the shark livers had brought much money, spoke of her as el mar which is masculine."
6899,3,They spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy.
6900,3,"But the old man always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favours, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them."
6901,3,"The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought.He was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his speed and the surface of the ocean was flat except for the occasional swirls of the current."
6902,3,"He was letting the current do a third of the work and as it started to be light he saw he was already further out than he had hoped to be at this hour.I worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing, he thought."
6903,3,Today Iլl work out where the schools of bonito and albacore are and maybe there will be a big one with them.Before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current.
6904,3,One bait was down forty fathoms.
6905,3,The second was at seventy-five and the third and fourth were down in the blue water at one hundred and one hundred and twenty-five fathoms.
6906,3,"Each bait hung head down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish, tied and sewed solid and all the projecting part of the hook, the curve and the point, was covered with fresh sardines."
6907,3,Each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they made a half-garland on the projecting steel.
6908,3,"There was no part of the hook that a great fish could feel which was not sweet smelling and good tasting.The boy had given him two fresh small tunas, or albacores, which hung on the two deepest lines like plummets and, on the others, he had a big blue runner and a yellow jack that had been used before; but they were in good condition still and had the excellent sardines to give them scent and attractiveness."
6909,3,"Each line, as thick around as a big pencil, was looped onto a green- sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils which could be made fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out over three hundred fathoms of line.Now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed gently to keep the lines straight up and down and at their proper depths."
6910,3,"It was quite light and any moment now the sun would rise.The sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats, low on the water and well in toward the shore, spread out across the current."
6911,3,"Then the sun was brighter and the glare came on the water and then, as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back at his eyes so that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it."
6912,3,He looked down into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into the dark of the water.
6913,3,"He kept them straighter than anyone did, so that at each level in the darkness of the stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that swam there.Others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred.But, he thought, I keep them with precision."
6914,3,Only I have no luck any more.
6915,3,But who knows? Maybe today.
6916,3,Every day is a new day.
6917,3,It is better to be lucky.
6918,3,But I would rather be exact.
6919,3,Then when luck comes you are ready.The sun was two hours higher now and it did not hurt his eyes so much to look into the east.
6920,3,"There were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far inshore.All my life the early sun has hurt my eyes, he thought."
6921,3,Yet they are still good.
6922,3,In the evening I can look straight into it without getting the blackness.
6923,3,It has more force in the evening too.
6924,3,But in the morning it is painful.Just then he saw a man-of-war bird with his long black wings circling in the sky ahead of him.
6925,3,"He made a quick drop, slanting down on his back-swept wings, and then circled again.҈eճ got something,Ӡthe old man said aloud."
6926,3,҈eճ not just looking.ӍHe rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling.
6927,3,He did not hurry and he kept his lines straight up and down.
6928,3,"But he crowded the current a little so that he was still fishing correctly though faster than he would have fished if he was not trying to use the bird.The bird went higher in the air and circled again, his wings motionless."
6929,3,"Then he dove suddenly and the old man saw flying fish spurt out of the water and sail desperately over the surface.҄olphin,Ӡthe old man said aloud."
6930,3,҂ig dolphin.ӍHe shipped his oars and brought a small line from under the bow.
6931,3,It had a wire leader and a medium-sized hook and he baited it with one of the sardines.
6932,3,He let it go over the side and then made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern.
6933,3,Then he baited another line and left it coiled in the shade of the bow.
6934,3,"He went back to rowing and to watching the long-winged black bird who was working, now, low over the water.As he watched the bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive and then swinging them wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying fish."
6935,3,The old man could see the slight bulge in the water that the big dolphin raised as they followed the escaping fish.
6936,3,"The dolphin were cutting through the water below the flight of the fish and would be in the water, driving at speed, when the fish dropped."
6937,3,"It is a big school of dolphin, he thought."
6938,3,They are widespread and the flying fish have little chance.
6939,3,The bird has no chance.
6940,3,The flying fish are too big for him and theygo too fast.He watched the flying fish burst out again and again and the ineffectual movements of the bird.
6941,3,"That school has gotten away from me, he thought."
6942,3,They are moving out too fast and too far.
6943,3,But perhaps I will pick up a stray and perhaps my big fish is around them.
6944,3,My big fish must be somewhere.The clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the coast was only a long green line with the gray blue hills behind it.
6945,3,"The water was a dark blue now, so dark that it was almost purple."
6946,3,As he looked down into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in the dark water and the strange light the sun made now.
6947,3,He watched his lines to see them go straight down out of sight into the water and he was happy to see so much plankton because it meant fish.
6948,3,"The strange light the sun made in the water, now that the sun was higher, meant good weather and so did the shape of the clouds over the land."
6949,3,"But the bird was almost out of sight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but some patches of yellow, sun-bleached Sargasso weed and the purple, formalized, iridescent, gelatinous bladder of a Portuguese man-of-war floating close beside the boat."
6950,3,It turned on its side and then righted itself.
6951,3,"It floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple filaments trailing a yard behind it in the water.ҁgua mala,Ӡthe man said."
6952,3,ҙou whore.ӍFrom where he swung lightly against his oars he looked down into the water and saw the tiny fish that were coloured like the trailing filaments and swam between them and under the small shade the bubble made as it drifted.
6953,3,They were immune to itspoison.
6954,3,"But men were not and when some of the filaments would catch on a line and rest there slimy and purple while the old man was working a fish, he would have welts and sores on his arms and hands of the sort that poison ivy or poison oak can give."
6955,3,But these poisonings from the agua mala came quickly and struck like a whiplash.The iridescent bubbles were beautiful.
6956,3,But they were the falsest thing in the sea and the old man loved to see the big sea turtles eating them.
6957,3,"The turtles saw them, approached them from the front, then shut their eyes so they were completely carapaced and ate them filaments and all."
6958,3,"The old man loved to see the turtles eat them and he loved to walk on them on the beach after a storm and hear them pop when he stepped on them with the horny soles of his feet.He loved green turtles and hawk-bills with their elegance and speed and their great value and he had a friendly contempt for the huge, stupid loggerheads, yellow in their armour-plating, strange in their love-making, and happily eating the Portuguese men-of-war with their eyes shut.He had no mysticism about turtles although he had gone in turtle boats for many years."
6959,3,"He was sorry for them all, even the great trunk backs that were as long as the skiff and weighed a ton.Most people are heartless about turtles because a turtleճ heart will beat for hours after he has been cut up and butchered."
6960,3,"But the old man thought, I have such a heart too and my feet and hands are like theirs."
6961,3,He ate the white eggs to give himself strength.
6962,3,He ate them all through May to be strong in September and October for the truly big fish.He also drank a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in the shack where many of the fishermen kept their gear.
6963,3,It was there for all fishermen who wanted it.
6964,3,Most fishermen hated the taste.
6965,3,"But it was no worse than getting up at the hours that they rose and it was very good against all colds and grippes and it was good for the eyes.Now the old man looked up and saw that the bird was circling again.҈eճ found fish,Ӡhe said aloud."
6966,3,No flying fish broke the surface and there was no scattering of bait fish.
6967,3,"But as the old man watched, a small tuna rose in the air, turned and dropped head first into the water."
6968,3,"The tuna shone silver in the sun and after he had dropped back into the water another and another rose and they were jumping in all directions, churning the water and leaping in long jumps after the bait."
6969,3,"They were circling it and driving it.If they donմ travel too fast I will get into them, the old man thought, and he watched the school working the water white and the bird now dropping and dipping into the bait fish that were forced to the surface in their panic.Ҕhe bird is a great help,Ӡthe old man said."
6970,3,"Just then the stern line came taut under his foot, where he had kept a loop of the line, and he dropped his oars and felt the weight of the small tunaճ shivering pull as he held the line firm and commenced to haul it in."
6971,3,The shivering increased as he pulled in and he could see the blue back of the fish in the water and the gold of his sides before he swung him over the side and into the boat.
6972,3,"He lay in the stern in the sun, compact and bullet shaped, his big,unintelligent eyes staring as he thumped his life out against the planking of the boat with the quick shivering strokes of his neat, fast-moving tail."
6973,3,"The old man hit him on the head for kindness and kicked him, his body still shuddering, under the shade of the stern.ҁlbacore,Ӡhe said aloud."
6974,3,҈eլl make a beautiful bait.
6975,3,Heլl weigh ten pounds.ӍHe did not remember when he had first started to talk aloud when he was by himself.
6976,3,He had sung when he was by himself in the old days and he had sung at night sometimes when he was alone steering on his watch in the smacks or in the turtle boats.
6977,3,"He had probably started to talk aloud, when alone, when the boy had left."
6978,3,But he did not remember.
6979,3,When he and the boy fished together they usually spoke only when it was necessary.
6980,3,They talked at night or when they were storm-bound by bad weather.
6981,3,It was considered a virtue not to talk unnecessarily at sea and the old man had always considered it so and respected it.
6982,3,"But now he said his thoughts aloud many times since there was no one that they could annoy.҉f the others heard me talking out loud they would think that I am crazy,Ӡhe said aloud."
6983,3,"҂ut since I am not crazy, I do not care.And the rich have radios to talk to them in their boats and to bring them the baseball.ӍNow is no time to think of baseball, he thought."
6984,3,Now is the time to think of only one thing.
6985,3,That which I was born for.
6986,3,"There might be a big one around that school, he thought."
6987,3,I picked up only a straggler from the albacore that were feeding.
6988,3,But they are working far out and fast.
6989,3,Everything that shows on the surfacetoday travels very fast and to the north-east.
6990,3,Can that be the time of day? Or is it some sign of weather that I do not know?He could not see the green of the shore now but only the tops of the blue hills that showed white as though they were snow- capped and the clouds that looked like high snow mountains above them.
6991,3,The sea was very dark and the light made prisms in the water.
6992,3,"The myriad flecks of the plankton were annulled now by the high sun and it was only the great deep prisms in the blue water that the old man saw now with his lines going straight down into the water that was a mile deep.The tuna, the fishermen called all the fish of that species tuna and only distinguished among them by their proper names when they came to sell them or to trade them for baits, were down again."
6993,3,"The sun was hot now and the old man felt it on the back of his neck and felt the sweat trickle down his back as he rowed.I could just drift, he thought, and sleep and put a bight of line around my toe to wake me."
6994,3,"But today is eighty-five days and I should fish the day well.Just then, watching his lines, he saw one of the projecting green sticks dip sharply.ҙes,Ӡhe said."
6995,3,"ҙes,Ӡand shipped his oars without bumping the boat."
6996,3,He reached out for the line and held it softly between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand.
6997,3,He felt no strain nor weight and he held the line lightly.
6998,3,Then it came again.
6999,3,"This time it was a tentative pull, not solid nor heavy, and he knew exactly what it was."
7000,3,"One hundred fathoms down a marlin was eating thesardines that covered the point and the shank of the hook where the hand-forged hook projected from the head of the small tuna.The old man held the line delicately, and softly, with his left hand, unleashed it from the stick."
7001,3,"Now he could let it run through his fingers without the fish feeling any tension.This far out, he must be huge in this month, he thought."
7002,3,"Eat them, fish."
7003,3,Eat them.
7004,3,Please eat them.
7005,3,How fresh they are and you down there six hundred feet in that cold water in the dark.
7006,3,Make another turn in the dark and come back and eat them.He felt the light delicate pulling and then a harder pull when a sardineճ head must have been more difficult to break from the hook.
7007,3,"Then there was nothing.҃ome on,Ӡthe old man said aloud."
7008,3,ҍake another turn.
7009,3,Just smell them.
7010,3,Arenմ they lovely? Eat them good now and then there is the tuna.
7011,3,Hard and cold and lovely.
7012,3,"Donմ be shy, fish."
7013,3,"Eat them.ӍHe waited with the line between his thumb and his finger, watching it and the other lines at the same time for the fish might have swum up or down."
7014,3,"Then came the same delicate pulling touch again.҈eլl take it,Ӡthe old man said aloud."
7015,3,҇od help him to take it.ӍHe did not take it though.
7016,3,"He was gone and the old man felt nothing.҈e canմ have gone,Ӡhe said."
7017,3,҃hrist knows he canմ havegone.
7018,3,Heճ making a turn.
7019,3,Maybe he has been hooked before and he remembers something of it.Then he felt the gentle touch on the line and he was happy.
7020,3,"҉t was only his turn,Ӡhe said."
7021,3,҈eլl take it.ӍHe was happy feeling the gentle pulling and then he felt something hard and unbelievably heavy.
7022,3,"It was the weight of the fish and he let the line slip down, down, down, unrolling off the first of the two reserve coils."
7023,3,"As it went down, slipping lightly through the old manճ fingers, he still could feel the great weight, though the pressure of his thumb and finger were almost imperceptible.җhat a fish,Ӡhe said."
7024,3,"҈e has it sideways in his mouth now and he is moving off with it.ӍThen he will turn and swallow it, he thought."
7025,3,He did not say that because he knew that if you said a good thing it might not happen.
7026,3,He knew what a huge fish this was and he thought of him moving away in the darkness with the tuna held crosswise in his mouth.
7027,3,At that moment he felt him stop moving but the weight was still there.
7028,3,Then the weight increased and he gave more line.
7029,3,"He tightened the pressure of his thumb and finger for a moment and the weight increased and was going straight down.҈eճ taken it,Ӡhe said."
7030,3,Ҏow Iլl let him eat it well.ӍHe let the line slip through his fingers while he reached down with his left hand and made fast the free end of the two reserve coils to the loop of the two reserve coils of the next line.
7031,3,Now hewas ready.
7032,3,"He had three forty-fathom coils of line in reserve now, as well as the coil he was using.҅at it a little more,Ӡhe said."
7033,3,"҅at it well.ӍEat it so that the point of the hook goes into your heart and kills you, he thought."
7034,3,Come up easy and let me put the harpoon into you.
7035,3,All right.
7036,3,"Are you ready? Have you been long enough at table?Ҏow!Ӡhe said aloud and struck hard with both hands, gained a yard of line and then struck again and again, swinging with each arm alternately on the cord with all the strength of his arms and the pivoted weight of his body.Nothing happened."
7037,3,The fish just moved away slowly and the old man could not raise him an inch.
7038,3,His line was strong and made for heavy fish and he held it against his hack until it was so taut that beads of water were jumping from it.
7039,3,"Then it began to make a slow hissing sound in the water and he still held it, bracing himself against the thwart and leaning back against the pull."
7040,3,The boat began to move slowly off toward the north-west.The fish moved steadily and they travelled slowly on the calm water.
7041,3,The other baits were still in the water but there was nothing to be done.҉ wish I had the boyӠthe old man said aloud.
7042,3,҉խ being towed by a fish and Iխ the towing bitt.
7043,3,I could make the line fast.
7044,3,But then he could break it.
7045,3,I must hold him all I can and give him line when he must have it.
7046,3,"Thank God he is travelling and not going down.ӍWhat I will do if he decides to go down, I donմ know."
7047,3,What Iլl do if he sounds and dies I donմ know.
7048,3,But Iլl do something.
7049,3,"There are plenty of things I can do.He held the line against his back and watched its slant in the water and the skiff moving steadily to the north-west.This will kill him, the old man thought."
7050,3,He canմ do this forever.
7051,3,"But four hours later the fish was still swimming steadily out to sea, towing the skiff, and the old man was still braced solidly with the line across his back.҉t was noon when I hooked him,Ӡhe said."
7052,3,ҁnd I have never seen him.ӍHe had pushed his straw hat hard down on his head before he hooked the fish and it was cutting his forehead.
7053,3,"He was thirsty too and he got down on his knees and, being careful not to jerk on the line, moved as far into the bow as he could get and reached the water bottle with one hand."
7054,3,He opened it and drank a little.
7055,3,Then he rested against the bow.
7056,3,He rested sitting on the un-stepped mast and sail and tried not to think but only to endure.Then he looked behind him and saw that no land was visible.
7057,3,"That makes no difference, he thought."
7058,3,I can always come in on the glow from Havana.
7059,3,There are two more hours before the sun sets and maybe he will come up before that.
7060,3,If he doesnմ maybe he will come up with the moon.
7061,3,If he does not do that maybe he will come up with the sunrise.
7062,3,I have no cramps and I feel strong.
7063,3,It is he that has the hook in his mouth.
7064,3,But what a fish to pull like that.
7065,3,He must have his mouth shut tight on thewire.
7066,3,I wish I could see him.
7067,3,I wish I could see him only once to know what I have against me.The fish never changed his course nor his direction all that night as far as the man could tell from watching the stars.
7068,3,It was cold after the sun went down and the old manճ sweat dried cold on his back and his arms and his old legs.
7069,3,During the day he had taken the sack that covered the bait box and spread it in the sun to dry.
7070,3,After the sun went down he tied it around his neck so that it hung down over his back and he cautiously worked it down under the line that was across his shoulders now.
7071,3,The sack cushioned the line and he had found a way of leaning forward against the bow so that he was almost comfortable.
7072,3,"The position actually was only somewhat less intolerable; but he thought of it as almost comfortable.I can do nothing with him and he can do nothing with me, he thought."
7073,3,Not as long as he keeps this up.Once he stood up and urinated over the side of the skiff and looked at the stars and checked his course.
7074,3,The line showed like a phosphorescent streak in the water straight out from his shoulders.
7075,3,"They were moving more slowly now and the glow of Havana was not so strong, so that he knew the current must be carrying them to the eastward."
7076,3,"If I lose the glare of Havana we must be going more to the eastward, he thought."
7077,3,For if the fishճ course held true I must see it for many more hours.
7078,3,"I wonder how the baseball came out in the grand leagues today, he thought."
7079,3,It would be wonderful to do this with a radio.
7080,3,"Then he thought, think of it always."
7081,3,Think of what you are doing.
7082,3,"You must do nothing stupid.Then he said aloud, ҉ wish I had the boy."
7083,3,"To help me and to see this.ӍNo one should be alone in their old age, he thought."
7084,3,But it is unavoidable.
7085,3,I must remember to eat the tuna before he spoils in order to keep strong.
7086,3,"Remember, no matter how little you want to, that you must eat him in the morning."
7087,3,"Remember, he said to himself.During the night two porpoises came around the boat and he could hear them rolling and blowing."
7088,3,"He could tell the difference between the blowing noise the male made and the sighing blow of the female.Ҕhey are good,Ӡhe said."
7089,3,Ҕhey play and make jokes and love one another.
7090,3,They are our brothers like the flying fish.ӍThen he began to pity the great fish that he had hooked.
7091,3,"He is wonderful and strange and who knows how old he is, he thought."
7092,3,Never have I had such a strong fish nor one who acted so strangely.
7093,3,Perhaps he is too wise to jump.
7094,3,He could ruin me by jumping or by a wild rush.
7095,3,But perhaps he has been hooked many times before and he knows that this is how he should make his fight.
7096,3,"He cannot know that it is only one man against him, nor that it is an old man."
7097,3,But what a great fish he is and what will he bring in the market if the flesh is good.
7098,3,He took the bait like a male and he pulls like a male and his fight has no panic in it.
7099,3,I wonder if he has any plans or if he is just as desperate as I am?He remembered the time he had hooked one of a pair of marlin.
7100,3,"The male fish always let the female fish feed first and thehooked fish, the female, made a wild, panic-stricken, despairing fight that soon exhausted her, and all the time the male had stayed with her, crossing the line and circling with her on the surface."
7101,3,He had stayed so close that the old man was afraid he would cut the line with his tail which was sharp as a scythe and almost of that size and shape.
7102,3,"When the old man had gaffed her and clubbed her, holding the rapier bill with its sandpaper edge and clubbing her across the top of her head until her colour turned to a colour almost like the backing of mirrors, and then, with the boyճ aid, hoisted her aboard, the male fish had stayed by the side of the boat."
7103,3,"Then, while the old man was clearing the lines and preparing the harpoon, the male fish jumped high into the air beside the boat to see where the female was and then went down deep, his lavender wings, that were his pectoral fins, spread wide and all his wide lavender stripes showing."
7104,3,"He was beautiful, the old man remembered, and he had stayed.That was the saddest thing I ever saw with them, the old man thought."
7105,3,"The boy was sad too and we begged her pardon and butchered her promptly.҉ wish the boy was here,Ӡhe said aloud and settled himself against the rounded planks of the bow and felt the strength of the great fish through the line he held across his shoulders moving steadily toward whatever he had chosen.When once, through my treachery, it had been necessary to him to make a choice, the old man thought.His choice had been to stay in the deep dark water far out beyond all snares and traps and treacheries."
7106,3,My choice was togo there to find him beyond all people.
7107,3,Beyond all people in the world.
7108,3,Now we are joined together and have been since noon.
7109,3,"And no one to help either one of us.Perhaps I should not have been a fisherman, he thought."
7110,3,But that was the thing that I was born for.
7111,3,I must surely remember to eat the tuna after it gets light.Some time before daylight something took one of the baits that were behind him.
7112,3,He heard the stick break and the line begin to rush out over the gunwale of the skiff.
7113,3,In the darkness he loosened his sheath knife and taking all the strain of the fish on his left shoulder he leaned back and cut the line against the wood of the gunwale.
7114,3,Then he cut the other line closest to him and in the dark made the loose ends of the reserve coils fast.
7115,3,He worked skillfully with the one hand and put his foot on the coils to hold them as he drew his knots tight.
7116,3,Now he had six reserve coils of line.
7117,3,"There were two from each bait he had severed and the two from the bait the fish had taken and they were all connected.After it is light, he thought, I will work back to the forty-fathom bait and cut it away too and link up the reserve coils."
7118,3,I will have lost two hundred fathoms of good Catalan cardel and the hooks and leaders.
7119,3,That can be replaced.
7120,3,But who replaces this fish if I hook some fish and it cuts him off? I donմ know what that fish was that took the bait just now.
7121,3,It could have been a marlin or a broadbill or a shark.
7122,3,I never felt him.
7123,3,"I had to get rid of him too fast.Aloud he said, ҉ wish I had the boy.ӍBut you havenմ got the boy, he thought."
7124,3,"You have only yourself and you had better work back to the last line now, in the dark or not in the dark, and cut it away and hook up the two reserve coils.So he did it."
7125,3,It was difficult in the dark and once the fish made a surge that pulled him down on his face and made a cut below his eye.
7126,3,The blood ran down his cheek a little way.
7127,3,But it coagulated and dried before it reached his chin and he worked his way back to the bow and rested against the wood.
7128,3,"He adjusted the sack and carefully worked the line so that it came across a new part of his shoulders and, holding it anchored with his shoulders, he carefully felt the pull of the fish and then felt with his hand the progress of the skiff through the water.I wonder what he made that lurch for, he thought."
7129,3,The wire must have slipped on the great hill of his back.
7130,3,Certainly his back cannot feel as badly as mine does.
7131,3,"But he cannot pull this skiff forever, no matter how great he is."
7132,3,"Now everything is cleared away that might make trouble and I have a big reserve of line; all that a man can ask.҆ish,Ӡhe said softly, aloud, ҉լl stay with you until I am dead.ӍHeլl stay with me too, I suppose, the old man thought and he waited for it to be light."
7133,3,It was cold now in the time before daylight and he pushed against the wood to be warm.
7134,3,"I can do it as long as he can, he thought."
7135,3,And in the first light the line extended out and down into the water.
7136,3,"The boat moved steadily and when the first edge of the sun rose it was on the old manճ right shoulder.҈eճ headed north,Ӡthe old man said."
7137,3,"The current will have set us far to the eastward, he thought."
7138,3,I wish he would turn with the current.
7139,3,That would show that he was tiring.When the sun had risen further the old man realized that the fish was not tiring.
7140,3,There was only one favorable sign.
7141,3,The slant of the line showed he was swimming at a lesser depth.
7142,3,That did not necessarily mean that he would jump.
7143,3,"But he might.҇od let him jump,Ӡthe old man said."
7144,3,"҉ have enough line to handle him.ӍMaybe if I can increase the tension just a little it will hurt him and he will jump, he thought."
7145,3,"Now that it is daylight let him jump so that heլl fill the sacks along his backbone with air and then he cannot go deep to die.He tried to increase the tension, but the line had been taut up to the very edge of the breaking point since he had hooked the fish and he felt the harshness as he leaned back to pull and knew he could put no more strain on it."
7146,3,"I must not jerk it ever, he thought."
7147,3,Each jerk widens the cut the hook makes and then when he does jump he might throw it.
7148,3,Anyway I feel better with the sun and for once I do not have to look into it.There was yellow weed on the line but the old man knew that only made an added drag and he was pleased.
7149,3,"It was the yellow Gulf weed that had made so much phosphorescence in the night.҆ish,Ӡhe said, ҉ love you and respect you very much."
7150,3,"But I will kill you dead before this day ends.ӍLet us hope so, he thought.A small bird came toward the skiff from the north."
7151,3,He was a warbler and flying very low over the water.
7152,3,The old man could see that he was very tired.The bird made the stern of the boat and rested there.
7153,3,Then he flew around the old manճ head and rested on the line where he was more comfortable.҈ow old are you?Ӡthe old man asked the bird.
7154,3,҉s this your first trip?ӍThe bird looked at him when he spoke.
7155,3,"He was too tired even to examine the line and he teetered on it as his delicate feet gripped it fast.҉tճ steady,Ӡthe old man told him."
7156,3,҉tճ too steady.
7157,3,You shouldnմ be that tired after a windless night.
7158,3,"What are birds coming to?ӍThe hawks, he thought, that come out to sea to meet them."
7159,3,"But he said nothing of this to the bird who could not understand him anyway and who would learn about the hawks soon enough.Ҕake a good rest, small bird,Ӡhe said."
7160,3,"Ҕhen go in and take your chance like any man or bird or fish.ӍIt encouraged him to talk because his back had stiffened in the night and it hurt truly now.ғtay at my house if you like, bird,Ӡhe said."
7161,3,҉ am sorry I cannot hoist the sail and take you in with the small breeze that is rising.
7162,3,But I am with a friend.ӍJust then the fish gave a sudden lurch that pulled the old man down onto the bow and would have pulled him overboard if he had not braced himself and given some line.The bird had flown up when the line jerked and the old man had not even seen him go.
7163,3,"He felt the line carefully with his right hand and noticed his hand was bleeding.ғomething hurt him then,Ӡhe said aloud and pulled back on the line to see if he could turn the fish."
7164,3,"But when he was touching the breaking point he held steady and settled back against the strain of the line.ҙouղe feeling it now, fish,Ӡhe said."
7165,3,"ҁnd so, God knows, am I.ӍHe looked around for the bird now because he would have liked him for company."
7166,3,"The bird was gone.You did not stay long, the man thought."
7167,3,But it is rougher where you are going until you make the shore.
7168,3,How did I let the fish cut me with that one quick pull he made? I must be getting very stupid.
7169,3,Or perhaps I was looking at the small bird and thinking of him.
7170,3,"Now I will pay attention to my work and then I must eat the tuna so that I will not have a failure of strength.҉ wish the boy were here and that I had some salt,Ӡhe said aloud.Shifting the weight of the line to his left shoulder and kneeling carefully he washed his hand in the ocean and held it there, submerged, for more than a minute watching the blood trail away and the steady movement of the water against his handas the boat moved.҈e has slowed much,Ӡhe said.The old man would have liked to keep his hand in the salt water longer but he was afraid of another sudden lurch by the fish and he stood up and braced himself and held his hand up against the sun."
7171,3,It was only a line burn that had cut his flesh.
7172,3,But it was in the working part of his hand.
7173,3,"He knew he would need his hands before this was over and he did not like to be cut before it started.Ҏow,Ӡhe said, when his hand had dried, ҉ must eat the small tuna."
7174,3,I can reach him with the gaff and eat him here in comfort.ӍHe knelt down and found the tuna under the rn with the gaff and drew it toward him keeping it clear of the coiled lines.
7175,3,"Holding the line with his left shoulder again, and bracing on his left hand and arm, he took the tuna off the gaff hook and put the gaff back in place."
7176,3,He put one knee on the fish and cut strips of dark red meat longitudinally from the back of the head to the tail.
7177,3,They were wedge-shaped strips and he cut them from next to the back bone down to the edge of the belly.
7178,3,"When he had cut six strips he spread them out on the wood of the bow, wiped his knife on his trousers, and lifted the carcass of the bonito by the tail and dropped it overboard.҉ donմ think I can eat an entire one,Ӡhe said and drew his knife across one of the strips."
7179,3,He could feel the steady hard pull of the line and his left hand was cramped.
7180,3,"It drew up tight on the heavy cord and he looked at it in disgust.җhat kind of a hand is that,Ӡhe said."
7181,3,҃ramp then if you want.
7182,3,Make yourself into a claw.
7183,3,"It will do you no good.ӍCome on, he thought and looked down into the dark water at the slant of the line."
7184,3,Eat it now and it will strengthen the hand.
7185,3,It is not the handճ fault and you have been many hours with the fish.
7186,3,But you can stay with him forever.
7187,3,Eat the bonito now.He picked up a piece and put it in his mouth and chewed it slowly.
7188,3,"It was not unpleasant.Chew it well, he thought, and get all the juices."
7189,3,"It would not be bad to eat with a little lime or with lemon or with salt.҈ow do you feel, hand?Ӡhe asked the cramped hand that was almost as stiff as rigor mortis."
7190,3,҉լl eat some more for you.ӍHe ate the other part of the piece that he had cut in two.
7191,3,"He chewed it carefully and then spat out the skin.҈ow does it go, hand? Or is it too early to know?ӠHe took another full piece and chewed it.҉t is a strong full-blooded fish,Ӡhe thought."
7192,3,҉ was lucky to get him instead of dolphin.
7193,3,Dolphin is too sweet.
7194,3,"This is hardly sweet at all and all the strength is still in it.ӍThere is no sense in being anything but practical though, he thought."
7195,3,I wish I had some salt.
7196,3,"And I do not know whether the sun will rot or dry what is left, so I had better eat it all although I am not hungry."
7197,3,The fish is calm and steady.
7198,3,"I will eat it all and then I will be ready.҂e patient, hand,Ӡhe said."
7199,3,"҉ do this for you.ӍI wish I could feed the fish, he thought."
7200,3,He is my brother.
7201,3,But I must kill him and keep strong to do it.
7202,3,"Slowly and conscientiously he ate all of the wedge-shaped strips of fish.He straightened up, wiping his hand on his trousers.Ҏow,Ӡhe said."
7203,3,"ҙou can let the cord go, hand, and I will handle him with the right arm alone until you stop that nonsense.ӠHe put his left foot on the heavy line that the left hand had held and lay back against the pull against his back.҇od help me to have the cramp go,Ӡhe said."
7204,3,"҂ecause I do not know what the fish is going to do.ӍBut he seems calm, he thought, and following his plan."
7205,3,"But what is his plan, he thought."
7206,3,And what is mine? Mine I must improvise to his because of his great size.
7207,3,If he will jump I can kill him.
7208,3,But he stays down forever.
7209,3,Then I will stay down with him forever.He rubbed the cramped hand against his trousers and tried to gentle the fingers.
7210,3,But it would not open.
7211,3,"Maybe it will open with the sun, he thought."
7212,3,Maybe it will open when the strong raw tuna is digested.
7213,3,"If I have to have it, I will open it, cost whatever it costs."
7214,3,But I do not want to open it now by force.
7215,3,Let it open by itself and come back of its own accord.
7216,3,After all I abused it much in the night when it was necessary to free and untie the various lines.He looked across the sea and knew how alone he was now.
7217,3,But he could see the prisms in the deep dark water and the linestretching ahead and the strange undulation of the calm.
7218,3,"The clouds were building up now for the trade wind and he looked ahead and saw a flight of wild ducks etching themselves against the sky over the water, then blurring, then etching again and he knew no man was ever alone on the sea.He thought of how some men feared being out of sight of land in a small boat and knew they were right in the months of sudden bad weather."
7219,3,"But now they were in hurricane months and, when there are no hurricanes, the weather of hurricane months is the best of all the year.If there is a hurricane you always see the signs of it in the sky for days ahead, if you are at sea."
7220,3,"They do not see it ashore because they do not know what to look for, he thought."
7221,3,"The land must make a difference too, in the shape of the clouds."
7222,3,"But we have no hurricane coming now.He looked at the sky and saw the white cumulus built like friendly piles of ice cream and high above were the thin feathers of the cirrus against the high September sky.Ҍight brisa,Ӡhe said."
7223,3,"҂etter weather for me than for you, fish.ӠHis left hand was still cramped, but he was unknotting it slowly.I hate a cramp, he thought."
7224,3,It is a treachery of oneճ own body.
7225,3,It is humiliating before others to have a diarrhoea from ptomaine poisoning or to vomit from it.
7226,3,"But a cramp, he thought of it as a calambre, humiliates oneself especially when one is alone.If the boy were here he could rub it for me and loosen it downfrom the forearm, he thought."
7227,3,"But it will loosen up.Then, with his right hand he felt the difference in the pull of the line before he saw the slant change in the water."
7228,3,"Then, as he leaned against the line and slapped his left hand hard and fast against his thigh he saw the line slanting slowly upward.҈eճ coming up,Ӡhe said."
7229,3,҃ome on hand.
7230,3,Please come on.ӍThe line rose slowly and steadily and then the surface of the ocean bulged ahead of the boat and the fish came out.
7231,3,He came out unendingly and water poured from his sides.
7232,3,He was bright in the sun and his head and back were dark purple and in the sun the stripes on his sides showed wide and a light lavender.
7233,3,"His sword was as long as a baseball bat and tapered like a rapier and he rose his full length from the water and then re-entered it, smoothly, like a diver and the old man saw the great scythe-blade of his tail go under and the line commenced to race out.҈e is two feet longer than the skiff,Ӡthe old man said."
7234,3,The line was going out fast but steadily and the fish was not panicked.
7235,3,The old man was trying with both hands to keep the line just inside of breaking strength.
7236,3,"He knew that if he could not slow the fish with a steady pressure the fish could take out all the line and break it.He is a great fish and I must convince him, he thought."
7237,3,I must never let him learn his strength nor what he could do if he made his run.
7238,3,If I were him I would put in everything now and go until something broke.
7239,3,"But, thank God, they are not as intelligent as we who kill them; although they are more noble and more able.The old man had seen many great fish."
7240,3,"He had seen many that weighed more than a thousand pounds and he had caught two of that size in his life, but never alone."
7241,3,"Now alone, and out of sight of land, he was fast to the biggest fish that he had ever seen and bigger than he had ever heard of, and his left hand was still as tight as the gripped claws of an eagle.It will uncramp though, he thought."
7242,3,Surely it will uncramp to help my right hand.
7243,3,There are three things that are brothers: the fish and my two hands.
7244,3,It must uncramp.
7245,3,It is unworthy of it to be cramped.
7246,3,"The fish had slowed again and was going at his usual pace.I wonder why he jumped, the old man thought."
7247,3,He jumped almost as though to show me how big he was.
7248,3,"I know now, anyway, he thought."
7249,3,I wish I could show him what sort of man I am.
7250,3,But then he would see the cramped hand.
7251,3,Let him think I am more man than I am and I will be so.
7252,3,"I wish I was the fish, he thought, with everything he has against only my will and my intelligence.He settled comfortably against the wood and took his suffering as it came and the fish swam steadily and the boat moved slowly through the dark water."
7253,3,"There was a small sea rising with the wind coming up from the east and at noon the old manճ left hand was uncramped.҂ad news for you, fish,Ӡhe said and shifted the line over the sacks that covered his shoulders.He was comfortable but suffering, although he did not admit the suffering at all.҉ am not religious,Ӡhe said."
7254,3,"҂ut I will say ten Our Fathers and ten Hail Marys that I should catch this fish, and I promise to make a pilgrimage to the Virgin of Cobre if I catch him."
7255,3,That is a promise.ӍHe commenced to say his prayers mechanically.
7256,3,Sometimes he would be so tired that he could not remember the prayer and then he would say them fast so that they would come automatically.
7257,3,"Hail Marys are easier to say than Our Fathers, he thought.҈ail Mary full of Grace the Lord is with thee."
7258,3,"Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus."
7259,3,"Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death."
7260,3,"Amen.ӠThen he added, ҂lessed Virgin, pray for the death of this fish."
7261,3,"Wonderful though he is.ӍWith his prayers said, and feeling much better, but suffering exactly as much, and perhaps a little more, he leaned against the wood of the bow and began, mechanically, to work the fingers of his left hand.The sun was hot now although the breeze was rising gently.҉ had better re-bait that little line out over the stern,Ӡhe said."
7262,3,҉f the fish decides to stay another night I will need to eat again and the water is low in the bottle.
7263,3,I donմ think I can get anything but a dolphin here.
7264,3,But if I eat him fresh enough he wonմ be bad.
7265,3,I wish a flying fish would come on board tonight.
7266,3,But I have no light to attract them.
7267,3,A flying fish is excellent to eat raw and I would not have to cut him up.
7268,3,I must save all my strength now.
7269,3,"Christ, I did not know he was so big.Ӎ҉լl kill him though,Ӡhe said."
7270,3,"҉n all his greatness and his glory.ӍAlthough it is unjust, he thought."
7271,3,"But I will show him what a man can do and what a man endures.҉ told the boy I was a strange old man,Ӡhe said."
7272,3,Ҏow is when I must prove it.ӍThe thousand times that he had proved it meant nothing.
7273,3,Now he was proving it again.
7274,3,"Each time was a new time and he never thought about the past when he was doing it.I wish heդ sleep and I could sleep and dream about the lions, he thought."
7275,3,"Why are the lions the main thing that is left? Donմ think, old man, he said to himself, Rest gently now against the wood and think of nothing."
7276,3,He is working.
7277,3,Work as little as you can.It was getting into the afternoon and the boat still moved slowly and steadily.
7278,3,But there was an added drag now from the easterly breeze and the old man rode gently with the small sea and the hurt of the cord across his back came to him easily and smoothly.Once in the afternoon the line started to rise again.
7279,3,But the fish only continued to swim at a slightly higher level.
7280,3,The sun was on the old manճ left arm and shoulder and on his back.
7281,3,"So he knew the fish had turned east of north.Now that he had seen him once, he could picture the fish swimming in the water with his purple pectoral fins set wide as wings and the great erect tail slicing through the dark."
7282,3,"I wonderhow much he sees at that depth, the old man thought."
7283,3,"His eye is huge and a horse, with much less eye, can see in the dark.Once I could see quite well in the dark."
7284,3,Not in the absolute dark.
7285,3,"But almost as a cat sees.The sun and his steady movement of his fingers had uncramped his left hand now completely and he began to shift more of the strain to it and he shrugged the muscles of his back to shift the hurt of the cord a little.҉f youղe not tired, fish,Ӡhe said aloud, ҹou must be very strange.ӍHe felt very tired now and he knew the night would come soon and he tried to think of other things."
7286,3,"He thought of the Big Leagues, to him they were the Gran Ligas, and he knew that the Yankees of New York were playing the Tigres of Detroit.This is the second day now that I do not know the result of the juegos, he thought."
7287,3,But I must have confidence and I must be worthy of the great DiMaggio who does all things perfectly even with the pain of the bone spur in his heel.
7288,3,What is a bone spur? he asked himself.
7289,3,Un espuela de hueso.
7290,3,We do not have them.
7291,3,Can it be as painful as the spur of a fighting cock in oneճ heel? I do not think I could endure that or the loss of the eye and of both eyes and continue to fight as the fighting cocks do.
7292,3,Man is not much beside the great birds and beasts.
7293,3,"Still I would rather be that beast down there in the darkness of the sea.ҕnless sharks come,Ӡhe said aloud."
7294,3,"҉f sharks come, God pity him and me.ӍDo you believe the great DiMaggio would stay with a fish as long as I will stay with this one? he thought."
7295,3,I am sure he would and more since he is young and strong.
7296,3,Also his father was a fisherman.
7297,3,"But would the bone spur hurt him too much?҉ do not know,Ӡhe said aloud."
7298,3,"҉ never had a bone spur.ӍAs the sun set he remembered, to give himself more confidence, the time in the tavern at Casablanca when he had played the hand game with the great negro from Cienfuegos who was the strongest man on the docks."
7299,3,They had gone one day and one night with their elbows on a chalk line on the table and their forearms straight up and their hands gripped tight.
7300,3,Each one was trying to force the otherճ hand down onto the table.
7301,3,There was much betting and people went in and out of the room under the kerosene lights and he had looked at the arm and hand of the negro and at the negroճ face.
7302,3,They changed the referees every four hours after the first eight so that the referees could sleep.
7303,3,Blood came out from under the fingernails of both his and the negroճ hands and they looked each other in the eye and at their hands and forearms and the bettors went in and out of the room and sat on high chairs against the wall and watched.
7304,3,The walls were painted bright blue and were of wood and the lamps threw their shadows against them.
7305,3,The negroճ shadow was huge and it moved on the wall as the breeze moved the lamps.The odds would change back and forth all night and they fed the negro rum and lighted cigarettes for him.
7306,3,"Then the negro, after the rum, would try for a tremendous effort and once he had the old man, who was not an old man then but was Santiago El Campen, nearly three inches off balance."
7307,3,But the old man hadraised his hand up to dead even again.
7308,3,"He was sure then that he had the negro, who was a fine man and a great athlete, beaten."
7309,3,"And at daylight when the bettors were asking that it be called a draw and the referee was shaking his head, he had unleashed his effort and forced the hand of the negro down and down until it rested on the wood."
7310,3,The match had started on a Sunday morning and ended on a Monday morning.
7311,3,Many of the bettors had asked for a draw because they had to go to work on the docks loading sacks of sugar or at the Havana Coal Company.
7312,3,Otherwise everyone would have wanted it to go to a finish.
7313,3,But he had finished it anyway and before anyone had to go to work.For a long time after that everyone had called him The Champion and there had been a return match in the spring.
7314,3,But not much money was bet and he had won it quite easily since he had broken the confidence of the negro from Cienfuegos in the first match.
7315,3,After that he had a few matches and then no more.
7316,3,He decided that he could beat anyone if he wanted to badly enough and he decided that it was bad for his right hand for fishing.
7317,3,He had tried a few practice matches with his left hand.
7318,3,"But his left hand had always been a traitor and would not do what he called on it to do and he did not trust it.The sun will bake it out well now, he thought."
7319,3,It should not cramp on me again unless it gets too cold in the night.
7320,3,"I wonder what this night will bring.An airplane passed overhead on its course to Miami and he watched its shadow scaring up the schools of flying fish.җith so much flying fish there should be dolphin,Ӡhe said, andleaned back on the line to see if it was possible to gain any on his fish."
7321,3,But he could not and it stayed at the hardness and water-drop shivering that preceded breaking.
7322,3,"The boat moved ahead slowly and he watched the airplane until he could no longer see it.It must be very strange in an airplane, he thought."
7323,3,I wonder what the sea looks like from that height? They should be able to see the fish well if they do not fly too high.
7324,3,I would like to fly very slowly at two hundred fathoms high and see the fish from above.
7325,3,In the turtle boats I was in the cross-trees of the mast-head and even at that height I saw much.
7326,3,The dolphin look greener from there and you can see their stripes and their purple spots and you can see all of the school as they swim.
7327,3,Why is it that all the fast-moving fish of the dark current have purple backs and usually purple stripes or spots? The dolphin looks green of course because he is really golden.
7328,3,"But when he comes to feed, truly hungry, purple stripes show on his sides as on a marlin."
7329,3,"Can it be anger, or the greater speed he makes that brings them out?Just before it was dark, as they passed a great island of Sargasso weed that heaved and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a yellow blanket, his small line was taken by a dolphin."
7330,3,"He saw it first when it jumped in the air, true gold in the last of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air."
7331,3,"It jumped again and again in the acrobatics of its fear and he worked his way back to the stern and crouching and holding the big line with his right hand and arm, he pulled the dolphin in with his left hand, stepping on the gained line each time with his bare left foot."
7332,3,"When the fish was at the stern, plunging and cutting from side to side indesperation, the old man leaned over the stern and lifted the burnished gold fish with its purple spots over the stern."
7333,3,"Its jaws were working convulsively in quick bites against the hook and it pounded the bottom of the skiff with its long flat body, its tail and its head until he clubbed it across the shining golden head until it shivered and was still.The old man unhooked the fish, re-baited the line with another sardine and tossed it over."
7334,3,Then he worked his way slowly back to the bow.
7335,3,He washed his left hand and wiped it on his trousers.
7336,3,"Then he shifted the heavy line from his right hand to his left and washed his right hand in the sea while he watched the sun go into the ocean and the slant of the big cord.҈e hasnմ changed at all,Ӡhe said."
7337,3,"But watching the movement of the water against his hand he noted that it was perceptibly slower.҉լl lash the two oars together across the stern and that will slow him in the night,Ӡhe said."
7338,3,"҈eճ good for the night and so am I.ӍIt would be better to gut the dolphin a little later to save the blood in the meat, he thought."
7339,3,I can do that a little later and lash the oars to make a drag at the same time.
7340,3,I had better keep the fish quiet now and not disturb him too much at sunset.
7341,3,"The setting of the sun is a difficult time for all fish.He let his hand dry in the air then grasped the line with it and eased himself as much as he could and allowed himself to be pulled forward against the wood so that the boat took the strain as much, or more, than he did.Iխ learning how to do it, he thought."
7342,3,This part of it anyway.
7343,3,"Then too, remember he hasnմ eaten since he took the bait and he is huge and needs much food."
7344,3,I have eaten the whole bonito.Tomorrow I will eat the dolphin.
7345,3,He called it dorado.
7346,3,Perhaps I should eat some of it when I clean it.
7347,3,It will be harder to eat than the bonito.
7348,3,"But, then, nothing is easy.҈ow do you feel, fish?Ӡhe asked aloud."
7349,3,҉ feel good and my left hand is better and I have food for a night and a day.
7350,3,"Pull the boat, fish.ӍHe did not truly feel good because the pain from the cord across his back had almost passed pain and gone into a dullness that he mistrusted."
7351,3,"But I have had worse things than that, he thought."
7352,3,My hand is only cut a little and the cramp is gone from the other.
7353,3,My legs are all right.
7354,3,Also now I have gained on him in the question of sustenance.It was dark now as it becomes dark quickly after the sun sets in September.
7355,3,He lay against the worn wood of the bow and rested all that he could.
7356,3,The first stars were out.
7357,3,"He did not know the name of Rigel but he saw it and knew soon they would all be out and he would have all his distant friends.Ҕhe fish is my friend too,Ӡhe said aloud."
7358,3,҉ have never seen or heard of such a fish.
7359,3,But I must kill him.
7360,3,"I am glad we do not have to try to kill the stars.ӍImagine if each day a man must try to kill the moon, he thought."
7361,3,The moon runs away.
7362,3,"But imagine if a man each day should have to try to kill the sun? We were born lucky, he thought.Then he was sorry for the great fish that had nothing to eat and his determination to kill him never relaxed in his sorrow for him."
7363,3,"How many people will he feed, he thought."
7364,3,"But are they worthy to eat him? No, of course not."
7365,3,"There is no one worthy of eating him from the manner of his behaviour and his great dignity.I do not understand these things, he thought."
7366,3,But it is good that we do not have to try to kill the sun or the moon or the stars.
7367,3,"It is enough to live on the sea and kill our true brothers.Now, he thought, I must think about the drag."
7368,3,It has its perils and its merits.
7369,3,"I may lose so much line that I will lose him, if he makes his effort and the drag made by the oars is in place and the boat loses all her lightness."
7370,3,Her lightness prolongs both our suffering but it is my safety since he has great speed that he has never yet employed.
7371,3,No matter what passes I must gut the dolphin so he does not spoil and eat some of him to be strong.Now I will rest an hour more and feel that he is solid and steady before I move back to the stern to do the work and make the decision.
7372,3,In the meantime I can see how he acts and if he shows any changes.
7373,3,The oars are a good trick; but it has reached the time to play for safety.
7374,3,He is much fish still and I saw that the hook was in the corner of his mouth and he has kept his mouth tight shut.
7375,3,The punishment of the hook is nothing.
7376,3,"The punishment of hunger, and that he is against something that he does not comprehend, is everything."
7377,3,"Rest now, old man, and let him work until your next duty comes.He rested for what he believed to be two hours."
7378,4,"Sitting beside the road, watching the wagon mount the hill toward her, Lena thinks, ‘I have come from Alabama: a fur piece."
7379,4,All the way from Alabama a-walking.
7380,4,"A fur piece.’ Thinking although I have not been quite a month on the road I am already in Mississippi, further from home than I have ever been before."
7381,4,"I am now further from Doane’s Mill than I have been since I was twelve years old.She had never even been to Doane’s Mill until after her father and mother died, though six or eight times a year she went to town on Saturday, in the wagon, in a mail-order dress and her bare feet flat in the wagon bed and her shoes wrapped in a piece of paper beside her on the seat."
7382,4,She would put on the shoes just before the wagon reached town.
7383,4,After she got to be a big girl she would ask her father to stop the wagon at the edge of town and she would get down and walk.
7384,4,She would not tell her father why she wanted to walk in instead of riding.
7385,4,"He thought that it was because of the smooth streets, the sidewalks."
7386,4,"But it was be cause she believed that the people who saw her and whom she passed on foot would believe that she lived in the town too.When she was twelve years old her father and mother died in the same summer, in a log house of three rooms and a hall, without screens, in a room lighted by a bugswirled kerosene lamp, the naked floor worn smooth as old silver by naked feet."
7387,4,She was the youngest living child.
7388,4,Her mother died first.
7389,4,"She said, “Take care of paw.” Lena did so."
7390,4,"Then one day her father said, “You go to Doane’s Mill with McKinley."
7391,4,"You get ready to go, be ready when he comes.” Then he died."
7392,4,"McKinley, the brother, arrived in a wagon."
7393,4,"They buried the father in a grove behind a country church one afternoon, with a pine headstone."
7394,4,"The next morning she departed forever, though it is possible that she did not know this at the time, in the wagon with McKinley, for Doane’s Mill."
7395,4,The wagon was borrowed and the brother had promised to return it by nightfall.The brother worked in the mill.
7396,4,All the men in the village.
7397,4,worked in the mill or for it.
7398,4,It was cutting pine.
7399,4,It had been there seven years and in seven years more it would destroy all the timber within its reach.
7400,4,Then some of the machinery and most of the men who ran it and existed because of and for it would be loaded onto freight cars and moved away.
7401,4,"But some of the machinery would be left, since new pieces could always be bought on the installment plan—gaunt, staring, motionless wheels rising from mounds of brick rubble and ragged weeds with a quality profoundly astonishing, and gutted boilers lifting their rusting and unsmoking stacks with an air stubborn, baffled and bemused upon a stumppocked scene of profound and peaceful desolation, unplowed, untilled, gutting slowly into red and choked ravines beneath the long quiet rains of autumn and the galloping fury of vernal equinoxes."
7402,4,Then the hamlet which at its best day had borne no name listed on Postoffice Department annals would not now even be remembered by the hookwormridden heirs-at-large who pulled the buildings down and buried them in cookstoves and winter grates.There were perhaps five families there when Lena arrived.
7403,4,"There was a track and a station, and once a day a mixed train fled shrieking through it."
7404,4,"The train could be stopped with a red flag, but by ordinary it appeared out of the devastated hills with apparitionlike suddenness and wailing like a banshee, athwart and past that little less-than-village like a forgotten bead from a broken string."
7405,4,The brother was twenty years her senior.
7406,4,She hardly remembered him at all when she came to live with him.
7407,4,He lived in a four room and unpainted house with his labor- and child-ridden wife.
7408,4,For almost half of every year the sister-in-law was either lying in or recovering.
7409,4,During this time Lena did all the housework and took care of the other children.
7410,4,"Later she, told herself, ‘I reckon that’s why I got one so quick myself.’She slept in a lean-to room at the back of the house."
7411,4,"It had a window which she learned to open and close again in the dark without making a sound, even though there also slept in the lean-to room at first her oldest nephew and then the two oldest and then the three."
7412,4,She had lived there eight years before she opened the window for the first time.
7413,4,She had not opened it a dozen times hardly before she discovered that she should not have opened it at all.
7414,4,"She said to herself, ‘That’s just my luck.’The sister-in-law told the brother."
7415,4,"Then he remarked her changing shape, which he should have noticed some time before."
7416,4,He was a hard man.
7417,4,Softness and gentleness and youth (he was just forty) and almost everything else except a kind of stubborn and despairing fortitude and the bleak heritage of his bloodpride had been sweated out of him.
7418,4,He called her whore.
7419,4,"He accused the right man (young bachelors, or sawdust Casanovas anyway, were even fewer in number than families) but she would not admit it, though the man had departed six months ago."
7420,4,"She just repeated stubbornly, “He’s going to send for me."
7421,4,"He said he would send for me”; unshakable, sheeplike, having drawn upon that reserve of patient and steadfast fidelity upon which the Lucas Burches depend and trust, even though they do not intend to be present when the need for it arises."
7422,4,Two weeks later she climbed again through the window.
7423,4,"It was a little difficult, this time."
7424,4,"‘If it had been this hard to do before, I reckon I would not be doing it now,’ she thought."
7425,4,"She could have departed by the door, by daylight."
7426,4,Nobody would have stopped her.
7427,4,Perhaps she knew that.
7428,4,"But she chose to go by night, and through the window."
7429,4,She carried a palm leaf fan and a small bundle tied neatly in a bandanna handkerchief.
7430,4,It contained among other things thirty-five cents in nickels and dimes.
7431,4,Her shoes were a pair of his own which her brother had given to her.
7432,4,"They were but slightly worn, since in the summer neither of them wore shoes at all."
7433,4,When she felt the dust of the road beneath her feet she removed the shoes and carried them in her hand.She had been doing that now for almost four weeks.
7434,4,"Behind her the four weeks, the evocation of far, is a peaceful corridor paved with unflagging and tranquil faith and peopled with kind and nameless faces and voices: Lucas Burch? I don’t know."
7435,4,I don’t know of anybody by that name around here.
7436,4,This road? It goes to Pocahontas.
7437,4,He might be there.
7438,4,It’s possible.
7439,4,Here’s a wagon that’s going a piece of the way.
7440,4,"It will take you that far; backrolling now behind her a long monotonous succession of peaceful and undeviating changes from day to dark and dark to day again, through which she advanced in identical and anonymous and deliberate wagons as though through a succession of creakwheeled and limpeared avatars, like something moving forever and without progress across an urn.The wagon mounts the hill toward her."
7441,4,She passed it about a mile back down the road.
7442,4,"It was standing beside the road, the mules asleep in the traces and their heads pointed in the direction in which she walked."
7443,4,She saw it and she saw the two men squatting beside a barn beyond the fence.
7444,4,"She looked at the wagon and the men once: a single glance all-embracing, swift, innocent and profound."
7445,4,She did not stop; very likely the men beyond the fence had not seen her even look at the wagon or at them.
7446,4,Neither did she look back.
7447,4,"She went on out of sight, walking slowly, the shoes unlaced about her ankles, until she reached the top of the hill a mile beyond."
7448,4,"Then she sat down on the ditchbank, with her feet in the shallow ditch, and removed the shoes."
7449,4,After a while she began to hear the wagon.
7450,4,She heard it for some time.
7451,4,"Then it came into sight, mounting the hill.The sharp and brittle crack and clatter of its weathered and ungreased wood and metal is slow and terrific: a series of dry sluggish reports carrying for a half mile across the hot still pinewiney silence of the August afternoon."
7452,4,"Though the mules plod in a steady and unflagging hypnosis, the vehicle does not seem to progress."
7453,4,"It seems to hang suspended in the middle distance forever and forever, so infinitesimal is its progress, like a shabby bead upon the mild red string of road."
7454,4,"So much is this so that in the watching of it the eye loses it as sight and sense drowsily merge and blend, like the road itself, with all the peaceful and monotonous changes between darkness and day, like already measured thread being rewound onto a spool."
7455,4,"So that at last, as though out of some trivial and unimportant region beyond even distance, the sound of it seems to come slow and terrific and without meaning, as though it were a ghost travelling a half mile ahead of its own shape."
7456,4,"‘That far within my hearing before my seeing,’ Lena thinks."
7457,4,"She thinks of herself as already moving, riding again, thinking then it will be as if I were riding for a half mile before I even got into the wagon, before the wagon even got to where I was waiting, and that when the wagon is empty of me again it will go on for a half mile with me still in it."
7458,4,"She waits, not even watching the wagon now, while thinking goes idle and swift and smooth, filled with nameless kind faces and voices: Lucas Burch? You say you tried in Pocahontas? This road? It goes to Springvale."
7459,4,You wait here.
7460,4,There will be a wagon passing soon that will take you as far as it goes.
7461,4,"Thinking, ‘And if he is going all the way to Jefferson, I will be riding."
7462,4,within the hearing of Lucas Burch before his seeing.
7463,4,"He will hear the wagon, but he won’t know."
7464,4,So there will be one within his hearing before his seeing.
7465,4,And then he will see me and he will be excited.
7466,4,"And so there will be two within his seeing before his remembering.’While Armstid and Winterbottom were squatting against the shady wall of Winterbottom’s stable, they saw her pass in the road."
7467,4,"They saw at once that she was young, pregnant, and a stranger."
7468,4,"“I wonder where she got that belly,” Winterbottom said.“I wonder how far she has brought it afoot,” Armstid said.“Visiting somebody back down the road, I reckon,” Winterbottom said.“I reckon not."
7469,4,Or I would have heard.
7470,4,"And it ain’t nobody up my way, neither."
7471,4,"I would have heard that, too.”“I reckon she knows where she is going,” Winterbottom said."
7472,4,"“She walks like it.”“She’ll have company, before she goes much further,” Armstid said."
7473,4,"The woman had now gone on, slowly, with her swelling and unmistakable burden."
7474,4,"Neither of them had seen her so much as glance at them when she passed in a shapeless garment of faded blue, carrying a palm leaf fan and a small cloth bundle."
7475,4,"“She ain’t come from nowhere close,” Armstid said."
7476,4,"“She’s hitting that lick like she’s been at it for a right smart while and had a right smart piece to go yet.”“She must be visiting around here somewhere,” Winterbottom said.“I reckon I would have heard about it,” Armstid said."
7477,4,The woman went on.
7478,4,She had not looked back.
7479,4,"She went out of sight up the road: swollen, slow, deliberate, unhurried and tireless as augmenting afternoon itself."
7480,4,She walked out of their talking too; perhaps out of their minds too.
7481,4,Because after a while Armstid said what he had come to say.
7482,4,"He had already made two previous trips, coming in his wagon five miles and squatting and spitting for three hours beneath the shady wall of Winterbottom’s barn with the timeless unhaste and indirection of his kind, in order to say it."
7483,4,It was to make Winterbottom an offer for a cultivator which Winterbottom wanted to sell.
7484,4,At last Armstid looked at the sun and offered the price which he had decided to offer while lying in bed three nights ago.
7485,4,"“I know of one in Jefferson I can buy at that figure,” he said.“I reckon you better buy it,” Winterbottom said."
7486,4,"“It sounds like a bargain.”“Sho,” Armstid said."
7487,4,He spat.
7488,4,"He looked again at the sun, and rose."
7489,4,"“Well, I reckon I better get on toward home.”He got into his wagon and waked the mules."
7490,4,"That is, he put them into motion, since only a negro can tell when a mule is asleep or awake."
7491,4,"Winterbottom followed him to the fence, leaning his arms on the top rail."
7492,4,"“Yes, sir,” he said."
7493,4,“I’d sho buy that cultivator at that figure.
7494,4,"If you don’t take it, I be dog if I ain’t a good mind to buy it, myself, at that price."
7495,4,"I reckon the fellow that owns it ain’t got a span of mules to sell for about five dollars, has he?”“Sho,” Armstid said."
7496,4,"He drove on, the wagon beginning to fall into its slow and mile-consuming clatter."
7497,4,Neither does he look back.
7498,4,"Apparently he is not looking ahead either, because he does not see the woman sitting in the ditch beside the road until the wagon has almost reached the top of the hill."
7499,4,In the instant in which he recognises the blue dress he cannot tell if she has ever seen the wagon at all.
7500,4,"And no one could have known that he had ever looked at her either as, without any semblance of progress in either of them, they draw slowly together as the wagon crawls terrifically toward her in its slow palpable aura of somnolence and red dust in which the steady feet of the mules move dreamlike and punctuate by the sparse jingle of harness and the limber bobbing of jackrabbit ears, the mules still neither asleep nor awake as he halts them.From beneath a sunbonnet of faded blue, weathered now by other than formal soap and water, she looks up at him quietly and pleasantly: young, pleasantfaced, candid, friendly, and alert."
7501,4,She does not move yet.
7502,4,Beneath the faded garment of that same weathered blue her body is shapeless and immobile.
7503,4,The fan and the bundle lie on her lap.
7504,4,She wears no stockings.
7505,4,Her bare feet rest side by side in the shallow ditch.
7506,4,"The pair of dusty, heavy, manlooking shoes beside them are not more inert."
7507,4,"In the halted wagon Armstid sits, humped, bleacheyed."
7508,4,"He sees that the rim of the fan is bound neatly in the same faded blue as the sunbonnet and the dress.“How far you going?” he says.“I was trying to get up the road a pieceways before dark,” she says."
7509,4,She rises and takes up the shoes.
7510,4,"She climbs slowly and deliberately into the road, approaching the wagon."
7511,4,Armstid does not descend to help her.
7512,4,He merely holds the team still while she climbs heavily over the wheel and sets the shoes beneath the seat.
7513,4,Then the wagon moves on.
7514,4,"“I thank you,” she says."
7515,4,“It was right tiring afoot.”Apparently Armstid has never once looked full at her.
7516,4,Yet he has already seen that she wears no wedding ring.
7517,4,He does not look at her now.
7518,4,Again the wagon settles into its slow clatter.
7519,4,“How far you come from?” he says.She expels her breath.
7520,4,"It is not a sigh so much as a peaceful expiration, as though of peaceful astonishment."
7521,4,"“A right good piece, it seems now."
7522,4,"I come from Alabama.”“Alabama? In your shape? Where’s your folks?”She does not look at him, either."
7523,4,“I’m looking to meet him up this way.
7524,4,You might know him.
7525,4,His name is Lucas Burch.
7526,4,"They told me back yonder a ways that he is in Jefferson, working for the planing mill.”“Lucas Burch.” Armstid’s tone is almost identical with hers."
7527,4,They sit side by side on the sagging and brokenspringed seat.
7528,4,He can see her hands upon her lap and her profile beneath the sunbonnet; from the corner of his eye he sees it.
7529,4,She seems to be watching the road as it unrolls between the limber ears of the mules.
7530,4,"“And you come all the way here, afoot, by yourself, hunting for him?”She does not answer for a moment."
7531,4,Then she says: “Folks have been kind.
7532,4,"They have been right kind.”“Womenfolks too?” From the corner of his eye he watches her profile, thinking I don’t know what Martha’s going to say thinking, ‘I reckon I do know what Martha’s going to say."
7533,4,I reckon womenfolks are likely to be good without being very kind.
7534,4,"Men, now, might."
7535,4,But it’s only a bad woman herself that is likely to be very kind to another woman that needs the kindness’ thinking Yes I do.
7536,4,"I know exactly what Martha is going to say.She sits a little forward, quite still, her profile quite still, her cheek."
7537,4,"“It’s a strange thing,” she says.“How folks can look at a strange young gal walking the road in your shape and know that her husband has left her?” She does not move."
7538,4,"The wagon now has a kind of rhythm, its ungreased and outraged wood one with the slow afternoon, the road, the heat."
7539,4,"“And you aim to find him up here.”She does not move, apparently watching the slow road between the ears of the mules, the distance perhaps roadcarved and definite."
7540,4,“I reckon I’ll find him.
7541,4,It won’t be hard.
7542,4,"He’ll be where the most folks are gathered together, and the laughing and joking is."
7543,4,"He always was a hand for that.”Armstid grunts, a sound savage, brusque."
7544,4,"“Get up, mules,” he says; he says to himself, between thinking and saying aloud: ‘I reckon she will."
7545,4,"I reckon that fellow is fixing to find that he made a bad mistake when he stopped this side of Arkansas, or even Texas.’The sun is slanting, an hour above the horizon now, above the swift coming of the summer night."
7546,4,"The lane turns from the road, quieter even than the road."
7547,4,"“Here we are,” Armstid says.The woman moves at once."
7548,4,She reaches down and finds the shoes; apparently she is not even going to delay the wagon long enough to put them on.
7549,4,"“I thank you kindly,” she says."
7550,4,“It was a help.”The wagon is halted again.
7551,4,The woman is preparing to descend.
7552,4,"“Even if you get to Varner’s store before sundown, you’ll still be twelve miles from Jefferson,” Armstid says.She holds the shoes, the bundle, the fan awkwardly in one hand, the other free to help her down."
7553,4,"“I reckon I better get on,” she says.Armstid does not touch her."
7554,4,"“You come on and stay the night at my house,” he says; “where womenfolks—where a woman can ..."
7555,4,"if you—You come on, now."
7556,4,"I’ll take you on to Varner’s first thing in the morning, and you can get a ride into town."
7557,4,"There will be somebody going, on a Saturday."
7558,4,He ain’t going to get away on you overnight.
7559,4,"If he is in Jefferson at all, he will still be there tomorrow.”She sits quite still, her possessions gathered into her hand for dismounting."
7560,4,"She is looking ahead, to where the road curves on and away, crossslanted with shadows."
7561,4,“I reckon I got a few days left.”“Sho.
7562,4,You got plenty of time yet.
7563,4,Only you are liable to have some company at any time now that can’t walk.
7564,4,You come on home with me.” He puts the mules into motion without waiting for a reply.
7565,4,"The wagon enters the lane, the dim road."
7566,4,"The woman sits back, though she still holds the fan, the bundle, the shoes.“I wouldn’t be beholden,” she says."
7567,4,"“I wouldn’t trouble.”“Sho,” Armstid says."
7568,4,“You come on with me.” For the first time the mules move swiftly of their own accord.
7569,4,"“Smelling corn,” Armstid says, thinking, ‘But that’s the woman of it."
7570,4,"Her own self one of the first ones to cut the ground from under a sister woman, she’ll walk the public country herself without shame because she knows that folks, menfolks, will take care of her."
7571,4,She don’t care nothing about womenfolks.
7572,4,It wasn’t any woman that got her into what she don’t even call trouble.
7573,4,"Yes, sir."
7574,4,"You just let one of them get married or get into trouble without being married, and right then and there is where she secedes from the woman race and species and spends the balance of her life trying to get joined up with the man race."
7575,4,"That’s why they dip snuff and smoke and want to vote.’When the wagon passes the house and goes on toward the barnlot, his wife is watching it from the front door."
7576,4,"He does not look in that direction; he does not need to look to know that she will be there, is there."
7577,4,"‘Yes,’ he thinks with sardonic ruefulness, turning the mules into the open gate, ‘I know exactly what she is going to say."
7578,4,"I reckon I know exactly.’ He halts the wagon, he does not need to look to know that his wife is now in the kitchen, not watching now; just waiting."
7579,4,He halts the wagon.
7580,4,"“You go on to the house,” he says; he has already descended and the woman is now climbing slowly down, with that inward listening deliberation."
7581,4,"“When you meet somebody, it will be Martha."
7582,4,I’ll be in when I feed the stock.” He does not watch her cross the lot and go on toward the kitchen.
7583,4,He does not need to.
7584,4,Step by step with her he enters the kitchen door also and comes upon the woman who now watches the kitchen door exactly as she had watched the wagon pass from the front one.
7585,4,"‘I reckon I know exactly what she will say,’ he thinks.He takes the team out and waters and stalls and feeds them, and lets the cows in from the pasture."
7586,4,Then he goes to the kitchen.
7587,4,"She is still there, the gray woman with a cold, harsh, irascible face, who bore five children in six years and raised them to man—and womanhood."
7588,4,She is not idle.
7589,4,He does not look at her.
7590,4,He goes to the sink and fills a pan from the pail and turns his sleeves back.
7591,4,"“Her name is Burch,” he says."
7592,4,“At least that’s what she says the fellow’s name is that she is hunting for.
7593,4,Lucas Burch.
7594,4,"Somebody told her back down the road a ways that he is in Jefferson now.” He begins to wash, his back to her."
7595,4,"“She come all the way from Alabama, alone and afoot, she says.”Mrs."
7596,4,Armstid does not look around.
7597,4,She is busy at the table.
7598,4,"“She’s going to quit being alone a good while before she sees Alabama again,” she says.“Or that fellow Burch either, I reckon.” He is quite busy at the sink, with the soap and water."
7599,4,"And he can feel her looking at him, at the back of his head, his shoulders in the shirt of sweatfaded blue."
7600,4,“She says that somebody down at Samson’s told her there is a fellow named Burch or something working at the planing mill in Jefferson.”“And she expects to find him there.
7601,4,Waiting.
7602,4,With the house all furnished and all.”He cannot tell from her voice if she is watching him or not now.
7603,4,He towels himself with a split floursack.
7604,4,“Maybe she will.
7605,4,"If it’s running away from her he’s after, I reckon he’s going to find out he made a bad mistake when he stopped before he put the Mississippi River between them.” And now he knows that she is watching him: the gray woman not plump and not thin, manhard, workhard, in a serviceable gray garment worn savage and brusque, her hands on her hips, her face like those of generals who have been defeated in battle.“You men,” she says.“What do you want to do about it? Turn her out? Let her sleep in the barn maybe?”“You men,” she says."
7606,4,"“You durn men.”They enter the kitchen together, though Mrs."
7607,4,Armstid is in front.
7608,4,She goes straight to the stove.
7609,4,Lena stands just within the door.
7610,4,"Her head is uncovered now, her hair combed smooth."
7611,4,Even the blue garment looks freshened and rested.
7612,4,She looks on while Mrs.
7613,4,Armstid at the stove clashes the metal lids and handles the sticks of wood with the abrupt savageness of a man.
7614,4,"“I would like to help,” Lena says.Mrs."
7615,4,Armstid does not look around.
7616,4,She clashes the stove savagely.
7617,4,“You stay where you are.
7618,4,"You keep off your feet now, and you’ll keep off your back a while longer maybe.”“It would be a beholden kindness to let me help.”“You stay where you are."
7619,4,I been doing this three times a day for thirty years now.
7620,4,"The time when I needed help with it is done passed.” She is busy at the stove, not backlooking."
7621,4,"“Armstid says your name is Burch.”“Yes,” the other says."
7622,4,"Her voice is quite grave now, quite quiet."
7623,4,"She sits quite still, her hands motionless upon her lap."
7624,4,And Mrs.
7625,4,Armstid does not look around either.
7626,4,She is still busy at the stove.
7627,4,It appears to require an amount of attention out of all proportion to the savage finality with which she built the fire.
7628,4,It appears to engage as much of her attention as if it were an expensive watch.“Is your name Burch yet?” Mrs.
7629,4,Armstid says.The young woman does not answer at once.
7630,4,Mrs.
7631,4,"Armstid does not rattle the stove now, though her back is still toward the younger woman."
7632,4,Then she turns.
7633,4,"They look at one another, suddenly naked, watching one another: the young woman in the chair, with her neat hair and her inert hands upon her lap, and the older one beside the stove, turning, motionless too, with a savage screw of gray hair at the base of her skull and a face that might have been carved in sandstone."
7634,4,Then the younger one speaks.“I told you false.
7635,4,My name is not Burch yet.
7636,4,It’s Lena Grove.”They look at one another.
7637,4,Mrs.
7638,4,Armstid’s voice is neither cold nor warm.
7639,4,It is not anything at all.
7640,4,“And so you want to catch up with him so your name will be Burch in time.
7641,4,"Is that it?”Lena is looking down now, as though watching her hands upon her lap."
7642,4,"Her voice is quiet, dogged."
7643,4,Yet it is serene.
7644,4,“I don’t reckon I need any promise from Lucas.
7645,4,"It just happened unfortunate so, that he had to go away."
7646,4,His plans just never worked out right for him to come back for me like he aimed to.
7647,4,I reckon me and him didn’t need to make word promises.
7648,4,"When he found out that night that he would have to go, he—”“Found out what night? The night you told him about that chap?”The other does not answer for a moment."
7649,4,"Her face is calm as stone, but not hard."
7650,4,"Its doggedness has a soft quality, an inwardlighted quality of tranquil and calm unreason and detachment."
7651,4,Mrs.
7652,4,Armstid watches her.
7653,4,Lena is not looking at the other woman while she speaks.
7654,4,“He had done got the word about how he might have to leave a long time before that.
7655,4,He just never told me sooner because he didn’t want to worry me with it.
7656,4,"When he first heard about how he might have to leave, he knowed then it would be best to go, that he could get along faster somewhere where the foreman wouldn’t be down on him."
7657,4,But he kept on putting it off.
7658,4,"But when this here happened, we couldn’t put it off no longer then."
7659,4,The foreman was down on Lucas because he didn’t like him because Lucas was young and full of life all the time and the foreman wanted Lucas’ job to give it to a cousin of his.
7660,4,But he hadn’t aimed to tell me because it would just worry me.
7661,4,"But when this here happened, we couldn’t wait any longer."
7662,4,I was the one that said for him to go.
7663,4,"He said he would stay if I said so, whether the foreman treated him right or not."
7664,4,But I said for him to go.
7665,4,"He never wanted to go, even then."
7666,4,But I said for him to.
7667,4,To just send me word when he was ready for me to come.
7668,4,"And then his plans just never worked out for him to send for me in time, like he aimed."
7669,4,"Going away among strangers like that, a young fellow needs time to get settled down."
7670,4,"He never knowed that when he left, that he would need more time to get settled down in than he figured on."
7671,4,"Especially a young fellow full of life like Lucas, that likes folks and jollifying, and liked by folks in turn."
7672,4,"He didn’t know it would take longer than he planned, being young, and folks always after him because he is a hand for laughing and joking, interfering with his work unbeknownst to him because he never wanted to hurt folks’ feelings."
7673,4,"And I wanted him to have his last enjoyment, because marriage is different with a young fellow, a lively young fellow, and a woman."
7674,4,It lasts so long with a lively young fellow.
7675,4,Don’t you think so?”Mrs.
7676,4,Armstid does not answer.
7677,4,She looks at the other sitting in the chair with her smooth hair and her still hands lying upon her lap and her soft and musing face.
7678,4,"“Like as not, he already sent me the word and it got lost on the way."
7679,4,"It’s a right far piece from here to Alabama even, and I ain’t to Jefferson yet."
7680,4,"I told him I would not expect him to write, being as he ain’t any hand for letters."
7681,4,"‘You just send me your mouthword when you are ready for me,’ I told him."
7682,4,"‘I’ll be waiting.’ It worried me a little at first, after he left, because my name wasn’t Burch yet and my brother and his folks not knowing Lucas as well as I knew him."
7683,4,"How could they?” Into her face there comes slowly an expression of soft and bright surprise, as if she had just thought of something which she had not even been aware that she did not know."
7684,4,"“How could they be expected to, you see."
7685,4,"But he had to get settled down first; it was him would have all the trouble of being among strangers, and me with nothing to bother about except to just wait while he had all the bother and trouble."
7686,4,But after a while I reckon I just got too busy getting this chap up to his time to worry about what my name was or what folks thought.
7687,4,But me and Lucas don’t need no word promises between us.
7688,4,"It was something unexpected come up, or he even sent the word and it got lost."
7689,4,So one day I just decided to up and not wait any longer.”“How did you know which way to go when you started?”Lena is watching her hands.
7690,4,"They are moving now, plaiting with rapt bemusement a fold of her skirt."
7691,4,"It is not diffidence, shyness."
7692,4,It is apparently some musing reflex of the hand alone.
7693,4,“I just kept asking.
7694,4,"With Lucas a lively young fellow that got to know folks easy and quick, I knew that wherever he had been, folks would remember him."
7695,4,So I kept asking.
7696,4,And folks was right kind.
7697,4,"And sure enough, I heard two days back on the road that he is in Jefferson, working for the planing mill.”Mrs."
7698,4,Armstid watches the lowered face.
7699,4,Her hands are on her hips and she watches the younger woman with an expression of cold and impersonal contempt.
7700,4,“And you believe that he will be there when you get there.
7701,4,Granted that he ever was there at all.
7702,4,"That he will hear you are in the same town with him, and still be there when the sun sets.Lena’s lowered face is grave, quiet."
7703,4,Her hand has ceased now.
7704,4,"It lies quite still on her lap, as if it had died there."
7705,4,"Her voice is quiet, tranquil, stubborn."
7706,4,“I reckon a family ought to all be together when a chap comes.
7707,4,Specially the first one.
7708,4,"I reckon the Lord will see to that.”“And I reckon He will have to,” Mrs."
7709,4,"Armstid says, savagely, harshly."
7710,4,"Armstid is in bed, his head propped up a little, watching her across the footboard as, still dressed, she stoops into the light of the lamp upon the dresser, hunting violently in a drawer."
7711,4,She produces a metal box and unlocks it with a key suspended about her neck and takes out a cloth sack which she opens and produces a small china effigy of a rooster with a slot in its back.
7712,4,"It jingles with coins as she moves it and upends it and shakes it violently above the top of the dresser, shaking from the slot coins in a meagre dribbling."
7713,4,"Armstid in the bed watches her.“What are you fixing to do with your eggmoney this time of night?” he says.“I reckon it’s mine to do with what I like.” She stoops into the lamp, her face harsh, bitter."
7714,4,“God knows it was me sweated over them and nursed them.
7715,4,"You never lifted no hand.”“Sho,” he says."
7716,4,"“I reckon it ain’t any human in this country is going to dispute them hens with you, lessen it’s the possums and the snakes."
7717,4,"That rooster bank, neither,” he says."
7718,4,"Because, stooping suddenly, she jerks off one shoe and strikes the china bank a single shattering blow."
7719,4,"From the bed, reclining, Armstid watches her gather the remaining coins from among the china fragments and drop them with the others into the sack and knot it and reknot it three or four times with savage finality.“You give that to her,” she says."
7720,4,“And come sunup you hitch up the team and take her away from here.
7721,4,"Take her all the way to Jefferson, if you want.”“I reckon she can get a ride in from Varner’s store,” he says.Mrs."
7722,4,Armstid rose before day and cooked breakfast.
7723,4,It was on the table when Armstid came in from milking.
7724,4,"“Go tell her to come and eat,” Mrs."
7725,4,Armstid said.
7726,4,"When he and Lena returned to the kitchen, Mrs."
7727,4,Armstid was not there.
7728,4,"Lena looked about the room once, pausing at the door with less than a pause, her face already fixed in an expression immanent with smiling, with speech, prepared speech, Armstid knew."
7729,4,"But she said nothing; the pause was less than a pause.“Let’s eat and get on,” Armstid said."
7730,4,"“You still got a right good piece to go.” He watched her eat, again with the tranquil and hearty decorum of last night’s supper, though there was now corrupting it a quality of polite and almost finicking restraint."
7731,4,Then he gave her the knotted cloth sack.
7732,4,"She took it, her face pleased, warm, though not very much surprised.“Why, it’s right kind of her,” she said."
7733,4,“But I won’t need it.
7734,4,I’m so nigh there now.”“I reckon you better keep it.
7735,4,"I reckon you done noticed how Martha ain’t much on being crossed in what she aims to do.”“It’s right kind,” Lena said."
7736,4,She tied the money up in the bandanna bundle and put on the sunbonnet.
7737,4,The wagon was waiting.
7738,4,"When they drove down the lane, past the house, she looked back at it."
7739,4,"“It was right kind of you all,” she said.“She done it,” Armstid said."
7740,4,"“I reckon I can’t claim no credit.”“It was right kind, anyway."
7741,4,You’ll have to say goodbye to her for me.
7742,4,"I had hopened to see her myself, but …”“Sho,” Armstid said."
7743,4,“I reckon she was busy or something.
7744,4,"I’ll tell her.”They drove up to the store in the early sunlight, with the squatting men already spitting across the heelgnawed porch, watching her descend slowly and carefully from the wagon seat, carrying the bundle and the fan."
7745,4,Again Armstid did not move to assist her.
7746,4,He said from the seat: “This here is Miz Burch.
7747,4,She wants to go to Jefferson.
7748,4,"If anybody is going in today, she will take it kind to ride with them.”She reached the earth, in the heavy, dusty shoes."
7749,4,"She looked up at him, serene, peaceful."
7750,4,"“It’s been right kind,” she said.“Sho,” Armstid said."
7751,4,“I reckon you can get to town now.” He looked down at her.
7752,4,"Then it seemed an interminable while that he watched his tongue seek words, thinking quiet and swift, thought fleeing A man."
7753,4,All men.
7754,4,He will pass up a hundred chances to do good for one chance to meddle where meddling is not wanted.
7755,4,"He will overlook and fail to see chances, opportunities, for riches and fame and well-doing, and even sometimes for evil."
7756,4,But he won’t fail to see a chance to meddle.
7757,4,"Then his tongue found words, he listening, perhaps with the same astonishment that she did: “Only I wouldn’t set too much store by ..."
7758,4,store in ...” thinking She is not listening.
7759,4,"If she could hear words like that she would not be getting down from this wagon, with that belly and that fan and that little bundle, alone, bound for a place she never saw before and hunting for a man she ain’t going to ever see again and that she has already seen one time too many as it is."
7760,4,"“—any time you are passing back this way, tomorrow or even tonight …”“I reckon I’ll be all right now,” she said."
7761,4,"“They told me he is there.”He turned the wagon and drove back home, sitting hunched, bleacheyed, on the sagging seat, thinking, ‘It wouldn’t have done any good."
7762,4,She would not have believed the telling and hearing it any more than she will believe the thinking that’s been going on all around her for ...
7763,4,"It’s four weeks now, she said."
7764,4,No more than she will feel it and believe it now.
7765,4,"Setting there on that top step, with her hands in her lap and them fellows squatting there and spitting past her into the road."
7766,4,And not even waiting for them to ask her about it before she begins to tell.
7767,4,"Telling them of her own accord about that durn fellow like she never had nothing particular to either hide or tell, even when Jody Varner or some of them will tell her that that fellow in Jefferson at the planing mill is named Bunch and not Burch; and that not worrying her either."
7768,4,"I reckon she knows more than even Martha does, like when she told Martha last night about how the Lord will see that what is right will get done.’It required only one or two questions."
7769,4,"Then, sitting on the top step, the fan and the bundle upon her lap, Lena tells her story again, with that patient and transparent recapitulation of a lying child, the squatting overalled men listening quietly.“That fellow’s name is Bunch,” Varner says."
7770,4,“He’s been working there at the mill about seven years.
7771,4,"How do you know that Burch is there too?”She is looking away up the road, in the direction of Jefferson."
7772,4,"Her face is calm, waiting, a little detached without being bemused."
7773,4,“I reckon he’ll be there.
7774,4,At that planing mill and all.
7775,4,Lucas always did like excitement.
7776,4,He never did like to live quiet.
7777,4,That’s why it never suited him back at Doane’s Mill.
7778,4,"Why he—we decided to make a change: for money and excitement.”“For money and excitement,” Varner says."
7779,4,"“Lucas ain’t the first young buck that’s throwed over what he was bred to do and them that depended on him doing it, for money and excitement.”But she is not listening apparently."
7780,4,"She sits quietly on the top step, watching the road where it curves away, empty and mounting, toward Jefferson."
7781,4,"The squatting men along the wall look at her still and placid face and they think as Armstid thought and as Varner thinks: that she is thinking of a scoundrel who deserted her in trouble and who they believe that she will never see again, save his coattails perhaps already boardflat with running."
7782,4,"‘Or maybe it’s about that Sloane’s or Bone’s Mill she is thinking,’ Varner thinks."
7783,4,‘I reckon that even a fool gal don’t have to come as far as Mississippi to find out that whatever place she run from ain’t going to be a whole lot different or worse than the place she is at.
7784,4,"Even if it has got a brother in it that objects to his sister’s nightprowling,’ thinking I would have done the same as the brother; the father would have done the same."
7785,4,"She has no mother because fatherblood hates with love and pride, but motherblood with hate loves and cohabits.She is not thinking about this at all."
7786,4,She is thinking about the coins knotted in the bundle beneath her hands.
7787,4,"She is remembering breakfast, thinking how she can enter the store this moment and buy cheese and crackers and even sardines if she likes."
7788,4,"At Armstid’s she had had but a cup of coffee and a piece of cornbread: nothing more, though Armstid pressed her."
7789,4,"‘I et polite,’ she thinks, her hands lying upon the bundle, knowing the hidden coins, remembering the single cup of coffee, the decorous morsel of strange bread; thinking with a sort of serene pride: ‘Like a lady I et."
7790,4,Like a lady travelling.
7791,4,"But now I can buy sardines too if I should so wish.’So she seems to muse upon the mounting road while the slowspitting and squatting men watch her covertly, believing that she is thinking about the man and the approaching crisis, when in reality she is waging a mild battle with that providential caution of the old earth of and with and by which she lives."
7792,4,This time she conquers.
7793,4,"She rises and walking a little awkwardly, a little carefully, she traverses the ranked battery of maneyes and enters the store, the clerk following."
7794,4,"‘I’m a-going to do it,’ she thinks, even while ordering the cheese and crackers; ‘I’m a-going to do it,’ saying aloud: “And a box of sardines.” She calls them sour-deens."
7795,4,"“A nickel box.”“We ain’t got no nickel sardines,” the clerk says."
7796,4,“Sardines is fifteen cents.” He also calls them sour-deens.She muses.
7797,4,“What have you got in a can for a nickel?”“Ain’t got nothing except shoeblacking.
7798,4,I don’t reckon you want that.
7799,4,"Not to eat, noway.”“I reckon I’ll take the fifteen cent ones, then.” She unties the bundle and the knotted sack."
7800,4,It requires some time to solve the knots.
7801,4,"But she unties them patiently, one by one, and pays and knots the sack and the bundle again and takes up her purchase."
7802,4,When she emerges onto the porch there is a wagon standing at the steps.
7803,4,"A man is on the seat.“Here’s a wagon going to town,” they tell her."
7804,4,"“He will take you in.”Her face wakes, serene, slow, warm."
7805,4,"“Why, you’re right kind,” she says.The wagon moves slowly, steadily, as if here within the sunny loneliness of the enormous land it were outside of, beyond all time and all haste."
7806,4,From Varner’s store to Jefferson it is twelve miles.
7807,4,“Will we get there before dinner time?” she says.The driver spits.
7808,4,"“We mought,” he says.Apparently he has never looked at her, not even when she got into the wagon."
7809,4,"Apparently she has never looked at him, either."
7810,4,She does not do so now.
7811,4,"“I reckon you go to Jefferson a right smart.”He says, “Some.” The wagon creaks on."
7812,4,"Fields and woods seem to hang in some inescapable middle distance, at once static and fluid, quick, like mirages."
7813,4,Yet the wagon passes them.“I reckon you don’t know anybody in Jefferson named Lucas Burch.”“Burch?”“I’m looking to meet him there.
7814,4,"He works at the planing mill.”“No,” the driver says."
7815,4,“I don’t know that I know him.
7816,4,But likely there is a right smart of folks in Jefferson I don’t know.
7817,4,"Likely he is there.”“I’ll declare, I hope so."
7818,4,Travelling is getting right bothersome.”The driver does not look at her.
7819,4,"“How far have you come, looking for him?”“From Alabama."
7820,4,It’s a right far piece.”He does not look at her.
7821,4,His voice is quite casual.
7822,4,"“How did your folks come to let you start out, in your shape?”“My folks are dead."
7823,4,I live with my brother.
7824,4,I just decided to come on.”“I see.
7825,4,He sent you word to come to Jefferson.”She does not answer.
7826,4,He can see beneath the sunbonnet her calm profile.
7827,4,"The wagon goes on, slow, timeless."
7828,4,"The red and unhurried miles unroll beneath the steady feet of the mules, beneath the creaking and clanking wheels."
7829,4,The sun stands now high overhead; the shadow of the sunbonnet now falls across her lap.
7830,4,She looks up at the sun.
7831,4,"“I reckon it’s time to eat,” she says."
7832,4,"He watches from the corner of his eye as she opens the cheese and crackers and the sardines and offers them.“I wouldn’t care for none,” he says.“I’d take it kind for you to share.”“I wouldn’t care to."
7833,4,You go ahead and eat.”She begins to eat.
7834,4,"She eats slowly, steadily, sucking the rich sardine oil from her fingers with slow and complete relish."
7835,4,"Then she stops, not abruptly, yet with utter completeness, her jaw stilled in midchewing, a bitten cracker in her hand and her face lowered a little and her eyes, blank, as if she were listening to something very far away or so near as to be inside her."
7836,4,"Her face has drained of color, of its full, hearty blood, and she sits quite still, hearing and feeling the implacable and immemorial earth, but without fear or alarm."
7837,4,"‘It’s twins at least,’ she says to herself, without lip movement, without sound."
7838,4,Then the spasm passes.
7839,4,She eats again.
7840,4,The wagon has not stopped; time has not stopped.
7841,4,"The wagon crests the final hill and they see smoke.“Jefferson,” the driver says.“Well, I’ll declare,” she says."
7842,4,"“We are almost there, ain’t we?”It is the man now who does not hear."
7843,4,"He is looking ahead, across the valley toward the town on the opposite ridge."
7844,4,"Following his pointing whip, she sees two columns of smoke: the one the heavy density of burning coal above a tall stack, the other a tall yellow column standing apparently from among a clump of trees some distance beyond the town."
7845,4,"“That’s a house burning,” the driver says."
7846,4,"“See?”But she in turn again does not seem to be listening, to hear."
7847,4,"“My, my,” she says; “here I ain’t been on the road but four weeks, and now I am in Jefferson already."
7848,4,"My, my."
7849,4,A body does get around.”Chapter 2BYRON BUNCH knows this: It was one Friday morning three years ago.
7850,4,"And the group of men at work in the planer shed looked up, and saw the stranger standing there, watching them."
7851,4,They did not know how long he had been there.
7852,4,"He looked like a tramp, yet not like a tramp either."
7853,4,His shoes were dusty and his trousers were soiled too.
7854,4,"But they were of decent serge, sharply creased, and his shirt was soiled but it was a white shirt, and he wore a tie and a stiffbrim straw hat that was quite new, cocked at an angle arrogant and baleful above his still face."
7855,4,"He did not look like a professional hobo in his professional rags, but there was something definitely rootless about him, as though no town nor city was his, no street, no walls, no square of earth his home."
7856,4,"And that he carried his knowledge with him always as though it were a banner, with a quality ruthless, lonely, and almost proud."
7857,4,"“As if,” as the men said later, “he was just down on his luck for a time, and that he didn’t intend to stay down on it and didn’t give a damn much how he rose up.” He was young."
7858,4,"And Byron watched him standing there and looking at the men in sweatstained overalls, with a cigarette in one side of his mouth and his face darkly and contemptuously still, drawn down a little on one side because of the smoke."
7859,4,After a while he spat the cigarette without touching his hand to it and turned and went on to the mill office while the men in faded and worksoiled overalls looked at his back with a sort of baffled outrage.
7860,4,"“We ought to run him through the planer,” the foreman said."
7861,4,“Maybe that will take that look off his face.”They did not know who he was.
7862,4,None of them had ever seen him before.
7863,4,"“Except that’s a pretty risky look for a man to wear on his face in public,” one said: “He might forget and use it somewhere where somebody won’t like it.” Then they dismissed him, from the talk, anyway."
7864,4,They went back to their work among the whirring and grating belts and shafts.
7865,4,"But it was not ten minutes before the mill superintendent entered, with the stranger behind him.“Put this man on,” the superintendent said to the foreman."
7866,4,"“He says he can handle a scoop, anyhow."
7867,4,"You can put him on the sawdust pile.”The others had not stopped work, yet there was not a man in the shed who was not again watching the stranger in his soiled city clothes, with his dark, insufferable face and his whole air of cold and quiet contempt."
7868,4,"The foreman looked at him, briefly, his gaze as cold as the other’s."
7869,4,"“Is he going to do it in them clothes?”“That’s his business,” the superintendent said."
7870,4,"“I’m not hiring his clothes.”“Well, whatever he wears suits me if it suits you and him,” the foreman said."
7871,4,"“All right, mister,” he said."
7872,4,“Go down yonder and get a scoop and help them fellows move that sawdust.”The newcomer turned without a word.
7873,4,The others watched him go down to the sawdust pile and vanish and reappear with a shovel and go to work.
7874,4,The foreman and the superintendent were talking at the door.
7875,4,They parted and the foreman returned.
7876,4,"“His name is Christmas,” he said.“His name is what?” one said.“Christmas.”“Is he a foreigner?”“Did you ever hear of a white man named Christmas?” the foreman said.“I never heard of nobody a-tall named it,” the other said."
7877,4,"And that was the first time Byron remembered that he had ever thought how a man’s name, which is supposed to be just the sound for who he is, can be somehow an augur of what he will do, if other men can only read the meaning in time."
7878,4,It seemed to him that none of them had looked especially at the stranger until they heard his name.
7879,4,"But as soon as they heard it, it was as though there was something in the sound of it that was trying to tell them what to expect; that he carried with him his own inescapable warning, like a flower its scent or a rattlesnake its rattle."
7880,4,Only none of them had sense enough to recognise it.
7881,4,"They just thought that he was a foreigner, and as they watched him for the rest of that Friday, working in that tie and the straw hat and the creased trousers, they said among themselves that that was the way men in his country worked; though there were others who said, “He’ll change clothes tonight."
7882,4,He won’t have on them Sunday clothes when he comes to work in the morning.”Saturday morning came.
7883,4,"As the late arrivals came up just before the whistle blew, they were already saying, “Did he—Where—” The others pointed."
7884,4,The new man was standing alone down at the sawdust pile.
7885,4,"His shovel was beside him, and he stood in the same garments of yesterday, with the arrogant hat, smoking a cigarette."
7886,4,"“He was there when we come,” the first ones said."
7887,4,"“Just standing there, like that."
7888,4,"Like he hadn’t never been to bed, even.”He did not talk to any of them at all."
7889,4,And none of them tried to talk to him.
7890,4,"But they were all conscious of him, of the steady back (he worked well enough, with a kind of baleful and restrained steadiness) and arms."
7891,4,Noon came.
7892,4,"With the exception of Byron, they had brought no lunch with them today, and they began to gather up their belongings preparatory to quitting until Monday."
7893,4,"Byron went alone with his lunch pail to the pump house where they usually ate, and sat down."
7894,4,Then something caused him to look up.
7895,4,"A short distance away the stranger was leaning against a post, smoking."
7896,4,"Byron knew that he had been there when he entered, and would not even bother to go away."
7897,4,"Or worse: that he had come there deliberately, ignoring Byron as if he were another post."
7898,4,“Ain’t you going to knock off?” Byron said.The other expelled smoke.
7899,4,Then he looked at Byron.
7900,4,"His face was gaunt, the flesh a level dead parchment color."
7901,4,"Not the skin: the flesh itself, as though the skull had been molded in a still and deadly regularity and then baked in a fierce oven."
7902,4,“How much do they pay for overtime?” he said.
7903,4,And then Byron knew.
7904,4,"He knew then why the other worked in the Sunday clothes, and why he had had no lunch with him either yesterday or today, and why he had not quit with the others at noon."
7905,4,He knew as well as if the man had told him that he did not have a nickel in his pockets and that in all likelihood he had lived on cigarettes for two or three days now.
7906,4,"Almost with the thought Byron was offering his own pail, the action as reflex as the thought."
7907,4,"Because before the act was completed the man, without changing his indolent and contemptuous attitude, turned his face and looked once at the proffered pail through the drooping smoke of the cigarette."
7908,4,“I ain’t hungry.
7909,4,Keep your muck.”Monday morning came and Byron proved himself right.
7910,4,"The man came to work in new overalls, and with a paper bag of food."
7911,4,"But he did not squat with them in the pump house to eat at noon, and the look was still on his face."
7912,4,"“Let it stay there,” the foreman said."
7913,4,"“Simms ain’t hiring his face anymore than his clothes.”Simms hadn’t hired the stranger’s tongue, either, Byron thought."
7914,4,"At least, Christmas didn’t seem to think so, to act so."
7915,4,"He still had nothing to say to anyone, even after six months."
7916,4,No one knew what he did between mill hours.
7917,4,"Now and then one of his fellow workers would pass him on the square down town after supper, and it would be as though Christmas had never seen the other before."
7918,4,He would be wearing then the new hat and the ironed trousers and the cigarette in one side of his mouth and the smoke sneering across his face.
7919,4,"No one knew where he lived, slept at night, save that now and then someone would see him following a path that came up through the woods on the edge of town, as if he might live out that way somewhere.This is not what Byron knows now."
7920,4,"This is just what he knew then, what he heard and watched as it came to his knowledge."
7921,4,"None of them knew then where Christmas lived and what he was actually doing behind the veil, the screen, of his negro’s job at the mill."
7922,4,"Possibly no one would ever have known if it had not been for the other stranger, Brown."
7923,4,"But as soon as Brown told, there were a dozen men who admitted having bought whiskey from Christmas for over two years, meeting him at night and alone in the woods behind an old colonial plantation house two miles from town, in which a middle-aged spinster named Burden lived alone."
7924,4,"But even the ones who bought the whiskey did not know that Christmas was actually living in a tumble down negro cabin on Miss Burden’s place, and that he had been living in it for more than two years.Then one day about six months ago another stranger appeared at the mill as Christmas had done, seeking work."
7925,4,"He was young too, tall, already in overalls which looked as though he had been in them constantly for some time, and he looked as though he had been travelling light also."
7926,4,"He had an alert, weakly handsome face with a small white scar beside the mouth that looked as if it had been contemplated a great deal in the mirror, and a way of jerking his head quickly and glancing over his shoulder like a mule does in front of an automobile in the road, Byron thought."
7927,4,"But it was not alone backwatching, alarm; it seemed also to Byron to possess a quality of assurance, brass, as though the man were reiterating and insisting all the while that he was afraid of nothing that might or could approach him from behind."
7928,4,"And when Mooney, the foreman, saw the new hand, Byron believed that he and Mooney had the same thought."
7929,4,"Mooney said: “Well, Simms is safe from hiring anything at all when he put that fellow on."
7930,4,"He never even hired a whole pair of pants.”“That’s so,” Byron said."
7931,4,“He puts me in mind of one of these cars running along the street with a radio in it.
7932,4,"You can’t make out what it is saying and the car ain’t going anywhere in particular and when you look at it close you see that there ain’t even anybody in it.”“Yes,” Mooney said."
7933,4,“He puts me in mind of a horse.
7934,4,Not a mean horse.
7935,4,Just a worthless horse.
7936,4,"Looks fine in the pasture, but it’s always do always got a sore hoof when hitchingup time comes.”“But I reckon maybe the mares like him,” Byron said.“Sho,” Mooney said."
7937,4,“I don’t reckon he’d do even a mare any permanent harm.”The new hand went to work down in the sawdust pile with Christmas.
7938,4,"With a lot of motion to it, telling everybody who he was and where he had been, in a tone and manner that was the essence of the man himself, that carried within itself its own confounding and mendacity."
7939,4,"So that a man put no more belief in what he said that he had done than in what he said his name was, Byron thought."
7940,4,There was no reason why his name should not have been Brown.
7941,4,"It was that, looking at him, a man would know that at some time in his life he would reach some crisis in his own foolishness when he would change his name, and that he would think of Brown to change it to with a kind of gleeful exultation, as though the name had never been invented."
7942,4,"The thing was, there was no reason why he should have had or have needed any name at all."
7943,4,"Nobody cared, just as Byron believed that no one (wearing pants, anyway) cared where he came from nor where he went nor how long he stayed."
7944,4,"Because wherever he came from and wherever he had been, a man knew that he was just living on the country, like a locust."
7945,4,"It was as though he had been doing it for so long now that all of him had become scattered and diffused and now there was nothing left but the transparent and weightless shell blown oblivious and without destination upon whatever wind.He worked some, though, after a fashion."
7946,4,"Byron believed that there was not even enough left of him to do a good, shrewd job of shirking."
7947,4,"To desire to shirk, even, since a man must be better than common to do a good job of malingering, the same as a good job at anything else: of stealing and murdering even."
7948,4,"He must be aiming at some specific and definite goal, working toward it."
7949,4,And he believed that Brown was not.
7950,4,They heard how he went and lost his entire first week’s pay in a crap game on the first Saturday night.
7951,4,Byron said to Mooney: “I am surprised at that.
7952,4,I would have thought that maybe shooting dice would be the one thing he could do.”“Him?” Mooney said.
7953,4,"“What makes you think that he could be good at any kind of devilment when he ain’t any good at anything as easy as shovelling sawdust? that he could fool anybody with anything as hard to handle as a pair of dice, when he can’t with anything as easy to handle as a scoop?” Then he said, “Well, I reckon there ain’t any man so sorry he can’t beat somebody doing something."
7954,4,"Because he can at least beat that Christmas doing nothing at all.”“Sho,” Byron said, “I reckon that being good is about the easiest thing in the world for a lazy man.”“I reckon he’d be bad fast enough,” Mooney said, “if he just had somebody to show him how.”“Well, he’ll find that fellow somewhere, sooner or later,” Byron said."
7955,4,"They both turned and looked down at the sawdust pile, where Brown and Christmas labored, the one with that brooding and savage steadiness, the other with a higharmed and erratic motion which could not have been fooling even itself.“I reckon so,” Mooney said."
7956,4,"“But if I aimed to be bad, I’d sho hate to have him for my partner.”Like Christmas, Brown came to work in the same clothes which he wore on the street."
7957,4,"But unlike Christmas, he made no change in his costume for some time."
7958,4,"“He’ll win just enough in that crap game some Saturday night to buy a new suit and still have fifty cents in nickels to rattle in his pocket,” Mooney said."
7959,4,"“And on the next Monday morning we ain’t going to see him again.” Meanwhile Brown continued to come to work in the same overalls and shirt in which he had arrived in Jefferson, losing his week’s pay in the Saturday night dice game or perhaps winning a little, greeting either the one or the other with the same shouts of imbecile laughter, joking and chaffing with the very men who in all likelihood were periodically robbing him."
7960,4,Then one day they heard that he had won sixty dollars.
7961,4,"“Well, that’s the last we’ll see of him,” one said.“I don’t know,” Mooney said."
7962,4,“Sixty dollars is the wrong figure.
7963,4,"If it had been either ten dollars or five hundred, I reckon you’d be right."
7964,4,But not just sixty.
7965,4,"He’ll just feel now that he is settled down good here, drawing at last somewhere about what he is worth a week.” And on Monday he did return to work, in the overalls; they saw them, Brown and Christmas, down at the sawdust pile."
7966,4,"They had been watching the two of them down there from the day when Brown went to work: Christmas jabbing his shovel into the sawdust slowly and steadily and hard, as though he were chopping up a buried snake (“or a man,” Mooney said) and Brown leaning on his shovel while he apparently told Christmas a story, an anecdote."
7967,4,"Because presently he would laugh, shout with laughter, his head backflung, while beside him the other man worked with silent and unflagging savageness."
7968,4,"Then Brown would fall to again, working for a time once again as fast as Christmas, but picking up less and less in the scoop until at last the shovel would not even touch the sawdust in its flagging arc."
7969,4,"Then he would lean upon it again and apparently finish whatever it was that he was telling Christmas, telling to the man who did not even seem to hear his voice."
7970,4,"As if the other were a mile away, or spoke a different language from the one he knew, Byron thought."
7971,4,"And they would be seen together down town on Saturday evening sometimes: Christmas in his neat, soberly austere serge-and-white and the straw hat, and Brown in his new suit (it was tan, with a red criss-cross, and he had a colored shirt and a hat like Christmas’ but with a colored band) talking and laughing, his voice heard clear across the square and back again in echo, somewhat as a meaningless sound in a church seems to come from everywhere at once."
7972,4,"Like he aimed for everybody to see how he and Christmas were buddies, Byron thought."
7973,4,"And then Christmas would turn and with that still, sullen face of his walk out of whatever small gathering the sheer empty sound of Brown’s voice had surrounded them with, with Brown following, still laughing and talking."
7974,4,"And each time the other workmen would say, “Well, he won’t be back on the job Monday morning.” But each Monday he was back."
7975,4,"It was Christmas who quit first.He quit one Saturday night, without warning, after almost three years."
7976,4,It was Brown who informed them that Christmas had quit.
7977,4,"Some of the other workers were family men and some were bachelors and they were of different ages and they led a catholic variety of lives, yet on Monday morning they all came to work with a kind of gravity, almost decorum."
7978,4,"Some of them were young, and they drank and gambled on Saturday night, and even went to Memphis now and then."
7979,4,"Yet on Monday morning they came quietly and soberly to work, in clean overalls and clean shirts, waiting quietly until the whistle blew and then going quietly to work, as though there were still something of Sabbath in the overlingering air which established a tenet that, no matter what a man had done with his Sabbath, to come quiet and clean to work on Monday morning was no more than seemly and right to do.That is what they had always remarked about Brown."
7980,4,"On Monday morning as likely as not he would appear in the same soiled clothes of last week, and with a black stubble that had known no razor."
7981,4,"And he would be more noisy than ever, shouting and playing the pranks of a child of ten."
7982,4,To the sober others it did not look right.
7983,4,"To them it was as though he had arrived naked, or drunk."
7984,4,Hence it was Brown who on this Monday morning notified them that Christmas had quit.
7985,4,"He arrived late, but that was not it."
7986,4,"He hadn’t shaved, either; but that was not it."
7987,4,He was quiet.
7988,4,"For a time they did not know that he was even present, who by that time should have had half the men there cursing him, and some in good earnest."
7989,4,"He appeared just as the whistle blew and went straight to the sawdust pile and went to work without a word to anyone, even when one man spoke to him."
7990,4,"And then they saw that he was down there alone, that Christmas, his partner, was not there."
7991,4,"When the foreman came in, one said: “Well, I see you have lost one of your apprentice firemen.”Mooney looked down to where Brown was spading into the sawdust pile as though it were eggs."
7992,4,He spat briefly.
7993,4,“Yes.
7994,4,He got rich too fast.
7995,4,"This little old job couldn’t hold him.”“Got rich?” another said.“One of them did,” Mooney said, still watching Brown."
7996,4,“I saw them yesterday riding in a new car.
7997,4,He”—he jerked his head toward Brown—”was driving it.
7998,4,I wasn’t surprised at that.
7999,4,"I am just surprised that even one of them come to work today.”“Well, I don’t reckon Simms will have any trouble finding a man to fill his shoes in these times,” the other said."
8000,4,"“He wouldn’t have any trouble doing that at any time,” Mooney said.“It looked to me like he was doing pretty well.”“Oh,” Mooney said."
8001,4,“I see.
8002,4,"You are talking about Christmas.”“Who were you talking about? Has Brown said he is quitting too?”“You reckon he’s going to stay down there, working, with the other one riding around town all day in that new car?”“Oh.” The other looked at Brown too."
8003,4,"“I wonder where they got that car.”“I don’t,” Mooney said."
8004,4,"“What I wonder is, if Brown is going to quit at noon or work on until six o’clock.”“Well,” Byron said, “if I could get rich enough out here to buy a new automobile, I’d quit too.”One or two of the others looked at Byron."
8005,4,They smiled a little.
8006,4,"“They never got that rich out here,” one said."
8007,4,Byron looked at him.
8008,4,"“I reckon Byron stays out of meanness too much himself to keep up with other folks’,” the other said."
8009,4,They looked at Byron.
8010,4,“Brown is what you might call a public servant.
8011,4,"Christmas used to make them come way out to them woods back of Miss Burden’s place, at night; now Brown brings it right into town for them."
8012,4,"I hear tell how if you just know the pass word, you can buy a pint of whiskey out of his shirt front in any alley on a Saturday night.”“What’s the pass word?” another said."
8013,4,“Six bits?”Byron looked from face to face.
8014,4,“Is that a fact? Is that what they are doing?”“That’s what Brown is doing.
8015,4,I don’t know about Christmas.
8016,4,I wouldn’t swear to it.
8017,4,But Brown ain’t going to be far away from where Christmas is at.
8018,4,"Like to like, as the old folks say.”“That’s a fact,” another said."
8019,4,"“Whether Christmas is in it or not, I reckon we ain’t going to know."
8020,4,"He ain’t going to walk around in public with his pants down, like Brown does.”“He ain’t going to need to,” Mooney said, looking at Brown.And Mooney was right."
8021,4,"They watched Brown until noon, down there at the sawdust pile by himself."
8022,4,Then the whistle blew and they got their lunch pails and squatted in the pump shed and began to eat.
8023,4,"Brown came in, glum, his face at once sullen and injured looking, like a child’s, and squatted among them, his hands dangling between his knees."
8024,4,He had no lunch with him today.“Ain’t you going to eat any dinner?” one said.“Cold muck out of a dirty lard bucket?” Brown said.
8025,4,"“Starting in at daylight and slaving all day like a durn nigger, with a hour off at noon to eat cold muck out of a tin bucket.”“Well, maybe some folks work like the niggers work where they come from,” Mooney said."
8026,4,"“But a nigger wouldn’t last till the noon whistle, working on this job like some white folks work on it.”But Brown did not seem to hear, to be listening, squatting with his sullen face and his dangling hands."
8027,4,"It was as though he were not listening to any save himself, listening to himself: “A fool."
8028,4,"A man is a fool that will do it.”“You are not chained to that scoop,” Mooney said.“You durn right I ain’t,” Brown said.Then the whistle blew."
8029,4,They went back to work.
8030,4,They watched Brown down at the sawdust pile.
8031,4,"He would dig for a while, then he would begin to slow, moving slower and slower until at last he would be clutching the shovel as though it were a riding whip, and they could see that he was talking to himself."
8032,4,"“Because there ain’t nobody else down there for him to tell it to,” one said.‘It’s not that,” Mooney said."
8033,4,“He hasn’t quite convinced himself yet.
8034,4,"He ain’t quite sold yet.”“Sold on what?”“On the idea that he’s a bigger fool than even I think he is,” Mooney said.The next morning he did not appear."
8035,4,"“His address from now on will be the barbershop,” one said.“Or that alley just behind it,” another said.“I reckon we’ll see him once more,” Mooney said."
8036,4,“He’ll be out here once more to draw his time for yesterday.”Which he did.
8037,4,About eleven o’clock he came up.
8038,4,"He wore now the new suit and the straw hat, and he stopped at the shed and stood there looking at the working men as Christmas had done on that day three years ago, as if somehow the very attitudes of the master’s dead life motivated, unawares to him, the willing muscles of the disciple who had learned too quick and too well."
8039,4,But Brown merely contrived to look scattered and emptily swaggering where the master had looked sullen and quiet and fatal as a snake.
8040,4,"“Lay into it, you slaving bastards!” Brown said, in a merry, loud voice cropped with teeth.Mooney looked at Brown."
8041,4,Then Brown’s teeth didn’t show.
8042,4,"“You ain’t calling me that,” Mooney said, “are you?”Brown’s mobile face performed one of those instantaneous changes which they knew."
8043,4,"Like it was so scattered and so lightly built that it wasn’t any trouble for even him to change it, Byron thought."
8044,4,"“I wasn’t talking to you,” Brown said.“Oh, I see.” Mooney’s tone was quite pleasant, easy."
8045,4,"“It was these other fellows you were calling a bastard.”Immediately a second one said: “Were you calling that at me?”“I was just talking to myself,” Brown said.“Well, you have told God’s truth for once in your life,” Mooney said."
8046,4,"“The half of it, that is."
8047,4,"Do you want me to come up there and whisper the other half in your ear?”And that was the last they saw of him at the mill, though Byron knows and remembers now the new car (with presently a crumpled fender or two) about the town, idle, destinationless, and constant, with Brown lolling behind the wheel and not making a very good job of being dissolute and enviable and idle."
8048,4,"Now and then Christmas would be with him, but not often."
8049,4,And it is now no secret what they were doing.
8050,4,"It is a byword among young men and even boys that whiskey can be bought from Brown almost on sight, and the town is just waiting for him to get caught, to produce from his raincoat and offer to sell it to an undercover man."
8051,4,"They still do not know for certain if Christmas is connected with it, save that no one believes that Brown alone has sense enough to make a profit even from bootlegging, and some of them know that Christmas and Brown both live in a cabin on the Burden place."
8052,4,"But even these do not know if Miss Burden knows it or not, and if they did, they would not tell her."
8053,4,"She lives in the big house alone, a woman of middleage."
8054,4,"She has lived in the house since she was born, yet she is still a stranger, a foreigner whose people moved in from the North during Reconstruction."
8055,4,"A Yankee, a lover of negroes, about whom in the town there is still talk of queer relations with negroes in the town and out of it, despite the fact that it is now sixty years since her grandfather and her brother were killed on the square by an exslaveowner over a question of negro votes in a state election."
8056,4,"But it still lingers about her and about the place: something dark and outlandish and threatful, even though she is but a woman and but the descendant of them whom the ancestors of the town had reason (or thought that they had) to hate and dread."
8057,4,"But it is there: the descendants of both in their relationship to one another ghosts, with between them the phantom of the old spilled blood and the old horror and anger and fear.If there had been love once, man or woman would have said that Byron Bunch had forgotten her."
8058,4,"Or she (meaning love) him, more like—that small man who will not see thirty again, who his spent six days of every week for seven years at the planing mill, feeding boards into the machinery."
8059,4,"Saturday afternoons too he spends there, alone now, with the other workmen all down town in their Sunday clothes and neckties, in that terrific and aimless and restive idleness of men who labor.On these Saturday afternoons he loads the finished boards into freight cars, since he cannot operate the planer alone, keeping his own time to the final second of an imaginary whistle."
8060,4,"The other workmen, the town itself or that part of it which remembers or thinks about him, believe that he does it for the overtime which he receives."
8061,4,Perhaps this is the reason.
8062,4,Man knows so little about his fellows.
8063,4,In his eyes all men or women act upon what he believes would motivate him if he were mad enough to do what that other man or woman is doing.
8064,4,"In fact, there is but one man in the town who could speak with any certainty about Bunch, and with this man the town does not know that Bunch has any intercourse, since they meet and talk only at night."
8065,4,This man’s name is Hightower.
8066,4,"Twenty-five years ago he was minister of one of the principal churches, perhaps the principal church."
8067,4,This man alone knows where Bunch goes each Saturday evening when the imaginary whistle blows (or when Bunch’s huge silver watch says that it has blown).
8068,4,Mrs.
8069,4,"Beard, at whose boarding house Bunch lives, knows only that shortly after six o’clock each Saturday Bunch enters, bathes and changes to a suit of cheap serge which is not new, eats his supper and saddles the mule which he stables in a shed behind the house which Bunch himself patched up and roofed, and departs on the mule."
8070,4,She does not know where he goes.
8071,4,It is the minister Hightower alone who knows that Bunch rides thirty miles into the country and spends Sunday leading the choir in a country church—a service which lasts all day long.
8072,4,"Then some time around midnight he saddles the mule again and rides back to Jefferson at a steady, allnight jog."
8073,4,"And on Monday morning, in his clean overalls and shirt he will be on hand at the mill when the whistle blows."
8074,4,Mrs.
8075,4,Beard knows only that from Saturday’s supper to Monday’s breakfast each week his room and the mule’s homemade stable will be vacant.
8076,4,"Hightower alone knows where he goes and what he does there, because two or three nights a week Bunch visits Hightower in the small house where the ex-minister lives alone, in what the town calls his disgrace—the house unpainted, small, obscure, poorly lighted, mansmelling, manstale."
8077,4,"Here the two of them sit in the minister’s study, talking quietly: the slight, nondescript man who is utterly unaware that he is a man of mystery among his fellow workers, and the fifty-year-old outcast who has been denied by his church.Then Byron fell in love."
8078,4,He fell in love contrary to all the tradition of his austere and jealous country raising which demands in the object physical inviolability.
8079,4,It happens on a Saturday afternoon while he is alone at the mill.
8080,4,"Two miles away the house is still burning, the yellow smoke standing straight as a monument on the horizon."
8081,4,"They saw it before noon, when the smoke first rose above the trees, before the whistle blew and the others departed."
8082,4,"“I reckon Byron’ll quit too, today,” they said."
8083,4,"“With a free fire to watch.”“It’s a big fire,” another said."
8084,4,"“What can it be? I don’t remember anything out that way big enough to make all that smoke except that Burden house.”“Maybe that’s what it is,” another said."
8085,4,"“My pappy says he can remember how fifty years ago folks said it ought to be burned, and with a little human fat meat to start it good.”“Maybe your pappy slipped out there and set it afire,” a third said."
8086,4,They laughed.
8087,4,"Then they went back to work, waiting for the whistle, pausing now and then to look at the smoke."
8088,4,After a while a truck loaded with logs drove in.
8089,4,"They asked the truck driver, who had come through town.“Burden,” the driver said."
8090,4,“Yes.
8091,4,That’s the name.
8092,4,"Somebody in town said that the sheriff had gone out there too.”“Well, I reckon Watt Kennedy likes to watch a fire, even if he does have to take that badge with him,” one said.“From the way the square looks,” the driver said, “he won’t have much trouble finding anybody he wants out there to arrest.”The noon whistle blew."
8093,4,The others departed.
8094,4,"Byron ate lunch, the silver watch open beside him."
8095,4,"When it said one o’clock, he went back to work."
8096,4,"He was alone in the loading shed, making his steady and interminable journeys between the shed and the car, with a piece of folded tow sack upon his shoulder for a pad and bearing upon the pad stacked burdens of staves which another would have said he cold not raise nor carry, when Lena Grove walked into the door behind him, her face already shaped with serene anticipatory smiling, her mouth already shaped upon a name."
8097,4,"He hears her and turns and sees her face fade like the dying agitation of a dropped pebble in a spring.“You ain’t him,” she says behind her fading smile, with the grave astonishment of a child.“No, ma’am,” Byron says."
8098,4,"He pauses, half turning with the balanced staves."
8099,4,“I don’t reckon I am.
8100,4,Who is it I ain’t?”“Lucas Burch.
8101,4,"They told me—”“Lucas Burch?”“They told me I would find him out here.” She speaks with a kind of serene suspicion, watching him without blinking, as if she believes that he is trying to trick her."
8102,4,“When I got close to town they kept a-calling it Bunch instead of Burch.
8103,4,But I just thought they was saying it wrong.
8104,4,"Or maybe I just heard it wrong.”“Yes, ma’am,” he says."
8105,4,“That’s what it is: Bunch.
8106,4,"Byron Bunch.” With the staves still balanced on his shoulder he looks at her, at her swollen body, her heavy loins, at the red dust upon the man’s heavy shoes upon her feet."
8107,4,“Are you Miz Burch?”She does not answer at once.
8108,4,"She stands there just inside the door, watching him intently but without alarm, with that untroubled, faintly baffled, faintly suspicious gaze."
8109,4,Her eyes are quite blue.
8110,4,But in them is that shadow of the belief that he is trying to deceive her.
8111,4,“They told me away back on the road that Lucas is working at the planing mill in Jefferson.
8112,4,Lots of them told me.
8113,4,"And I got to Jefferson and they told me where the planing mill was, and I asked in town about Lucas Burch and they said, ‘Maybe you mean Bunch’; and so I thought they had just got the name wrong and so it wouldn’t make any difference."
8114,4,Even when they told me the man they meant wasn’t dark complected.
8115,4,You ain’t telling me you don’t know Lucas Burch out here.
8116,4,"FROM a little after two o'clock until almost sundown of the long still hot weary dead September afternoon they sat in what Miss Coldfield still called the office because her father had called it that—a dim hot airless room with the blinds all closed and fastened for forty-three summers because when she was a girl someone had believed that light and moving air carried heat and that dark was always cooler, and which (as the sun shone fuller and fuller on that side of the house) became latticed with yellow slashes full of dust motes which Quentin thought of as being flecks of the dead old dried paint itself blown inward from the scaling blinds as wind might have blown them.There was a wistaria vine blooming for the second time that summer on a wooden trellis before one window, into which sparrows came now and then in random gusts, making a dry vivid dusty sound before going away: and opposite Quentin, Miss Coldfield in the eternal black which she had worn for forty-three years now, whether for sister, father, or nothusband none knew, sitting so bolt upright in the straight hard chair that was so tall for her that her legs hung straight and rigid as if she had iron shinbones' and ankles, clear of the floor with that air of impotent and static rage like children's feet, and talking in that grim haggard amazed Voice until at last listening would renege and hearing-sense self-confound and the long-dead object of her impotent yet indomitable frustration would appear, as though by outraged recapitulation evoked, quiet inattentive and harmless, out of the biding and dreamy and victorious dust.Her voice would not cease, it would just vanish."
8117,4,"There would be the dim coffin-smelling gloom sweet and oversweet with the twice-bloomed wistaria against the outer wall by the savage quiet September sun impacted distilled and hyperdistilled, into which came now and then the loud cloudy flutter of the sparrows like a flat limber stick whipped by an idle boy, and the rank smell of female old flesh long embattled in virginity while the wan haggard face watched him above the faint triangle of lace at wrists and throat from the too tall chair in which she resembled a crucified child; and the voice not ceasing but vanishing into and then out of the long intervals like a stream, a trickle running from patch to patch of dried sand, and the ghost mused with shadowy docility as if it were the voice which he haunted where a more fortunate one would have had a house."
8118,4,"Out of quiet thunderclap he would abrupt (man-horse-demon) upon a scene peaceful and decorous as a schoolprize water color, faint sulphur-reek still in hair clothes and beard, with grouped behind him his band of wild niggers like beasts half tamed to walk upright like men, in attitudes wild and reposed, and manacled among them the French architect with his air grim, haggard, and taller-ran."
8119,4,"Immobile, bearded, and hand palm lifted the horseman sat; behind him the wild blacks and the captive architect huddled quietly, carrying in bloodless paradox the shovels and picks and axes of peaceful conquest."
8120,4,"Then in the long unamaze Quentin seemed to watch them overrun suddenly the hundred square miles of tranquil and astonished earth and drag house and formal gardens violently out of the soundless Nothing and clap them down like cards upon a table beneath the up-palm immobile and pontific, creating the Sutpen's Hundred, the Be Sutpen's Hundred like the oldentime Be Light."
8121,4,"Then hearing would reconcile and he would seem to listen to two separate Quentins now the Quentin Compson preparing for Harvard in the South, the deep South dead since 1865 and people with garrulous outraged baffled ghosts, listening, having to listen, to one of the ghosts which had refused to lie still even longer than most had, telling him about old ghost-times; and the Quentin Compson who was still too young to deserve yet to be a ghost, but nevertheless having to be one for all that, since he was born and bred in the deep South the same as she was the two separate Quentins now talking to one another in the long silence of notpeople, in notlanguage, like this: It seems that this demon—his name was Sutpen (Colonel Sutpen)—Colonel Sutpen."
8122,4,"Who came out of nowhere and without warning upon the land with a band of strange niggers and built a plantation—(Tore violently a plantation, Miss Rosa Coldfield says)—tore violently."
8123,4,"and married her sister Ellen and begot a son and a daughter which—(without gentleness begot, Miss Rosa Coldfield says)—without gentleness.Which should have been the jewels of his pride and the shield and comfort of his old age, only—(Only they destroyed him or something or he destroyed them or something And died)—and died."
8124,4,"Without regret, Miss Rosa Coldfield says—(Save by her) Yes, save by her."
8125,4,(And by Quentin Compson) Yes.
8126,4,"And by Quentin Compson.'Because you are going away to attend the college at Harvard they tell me,' Miss Coldfield said."
8127,4,"'So I don't imagine you will ever come back here and settle down as a country lawyer in a little town like Jefferson, since Northern people have already seen to it that there is little left in the South for a young man."
8128,4,So maybe you will enter the literary profession as so many Southern gentlemen and gentlewomen too are doing now and maybe some day you will remember this and write about it.
8129,4,You will be married then I expect and perhaps your wife will want a new gown or a new chair for the house and you can write this and submit it to the magazines.
8130,4,"Perhaps you will even remember kindly then the old woman who made you spend a whole afternoon sitting indoors and listening while she talked about people and events you were fortunate enough to escape yourself when you wanted to be out among young friends of your own age."" 'Yessum,' Quentin said."
8131,4,"Only she don't mean that, he thought."
8132,4,It's because she wants it told.
8133,4,It was still early then.
8134,4,"He had yet in his pocket the note which he had received by the hand of a small Negro boy just before noon, asking him to call and see her—the quaint, stiffly formal request which was actually a summons, out of another world almost—the queer archaic sheet of ancient good notepaper written over with the neat faded cramped script which, due to his astonishment at the request from a woman three times his age and whom he had known all his life without having exchanged a hundred words with her or perhaps to the fact that he was only twenty years old, he did not recognize as revealing a character cold, implacable, and even ruthless."
8135,4,"He obeyed it immediately after the noon meal, walking the half mile between his home and hers through the dry dusty heat of early September and so into the house."
8136,4,"It too was somehow smaller than its actual size—it was of two storeys—unpainted and a little shabby, yet with an air, a quality of grim endurance as though like her it had been created to fit into and complement a world in all ways a little smaller than the one in which it found itself."
8137,4,"There in the gloom of the shuttered hallway whose air was even hotter than outside, as if there were prisoned in it like in a tomb all the suspiration of slow heatladen time which had recurred during the forty-five years, the small figure in black which did not even rustle, the wan triangle of lace at wrists and throat, the dim face looking at him with an expression speculative, urgent, and intent, waited to invite him in.It's because she wants it told, he thought, so that people whom she will never see and whose names she will never hear and who have never heard her name nor seen her face will read it and know at last why God let us lose the war: that only through the blood of our men and the tears of our women could He slay this demon and efface his name and lineage from the earth."
8138,4,"Then almost immediately he decided that neither was this the reason why she had sent the note, and sending it, why to him, since if she had merely wanted it told, written, and even printed, she would not have needed to call in anybody—a woman who even in his (Quentin's) father's youth had already established herself as the town's and the county's poetess laureate by issuing to the stern and meager subscription list of the county newspaper poems, ode, eulogy, and epitaph, out of some bitter and implacable reserve of undefeat.It would be three hours yet before he would learn why she had sent for him because part of it, the first part of it, Quentin already knew.It was a part of his twenty years' heritage of breathing the same ai? and hearing his father talk about the man Sutpen; a part of the town's—Jefferson's—eighty years' heritage of the same air which the man himself had breathed between this September afternoon in 1909 and that Sunday morning in June in 1833 when he first rode into town out of no discernible past and acquired his land no one knew how and built his house, his mansion, apparently out of nothing and married Ellen Coldfield and begot his two children—the son who widowed the daughter who had not yet been a bride—and so accomplished his allotted course to its violent (Miss Coldfield at least would have said, just) end.Quentin had grown up with that; the mere names were interchangeable and almost myriad."
8139,4,"His childhood was full of them; his very body was an empty hall echoing with sonorous defeated names; he was not a being, an entity, he was a commonwealth.He was a barracks filled with stubborn backlooking ghosts still recovering, even forty-three years afterward, from the fever which had cured the disease, waking from the fever without even knowing that it had been the fever itself which they had fought against and not the sickness, looking with stubborn recalcitrance backward beyond the fever and into the disease with actual regret, weak from the fever yet free of the disease and not even aware that the freedom was that of impotence."
8140,4,"('But why tell me about it?"" he said to his father that evening, when he returned home, after she had dismissed him at last with his promise to return for her in the buggy; ' why tell me about it? What is it to me that the land of the earth or whatever it was got tired of him at last and turned and destroyed him? What if it did destroy her family too? It's going to turn and destroy us all some day, whether our name happens to be Sutpen or Coldfield or not."" 'Ah,' Mr Compson said."
8141,4,'Years ago we in the South made our women into ladies.
8142,4,Then the War came and made the ladies into ghosts.
8143,4,"So what else can we do, being gentlemen, but listen to them being ghosts?"" Then he said, 'Do you want to know the real reason why she chose you?"" They were sitting on the gallery after supper, waiting for the time Miss Coldfield had set for Quentin to call for her."
8144,4,"'It's because she will need someone to go with her—a man, a gentleman, yet one still young enough to do what she wants, do it the way she wants it done."
8145,4,"And she chose you because your grandfather was the nearest thing to a friend Sutpen ever had in this county, and she probably believes that Sutpen may have told your grandfather something about himself and her, about that engagement which did not engage, that troth which failed to plight.Might even have told your grandfather the reason why at the last she refused to marry him."
8146,4,—And that your grandfather might have told me and I might have told you.
8147,4,"And so, in a sense, the affair, no matter what happens out there tonight, will still be in the family; the skeleton (if it be a skeleton) still in the closet."
8148,4,"She may believe that if it hadn't been for your grandfather's friendship, Sutpen could never have got a foothold here, and that if he had not got that foothold, he could not have married Ellen."
8149,4,"So maybe she considers you partly responsible through heredity for what happened to her and her family through him."" Whatever her reason for choosing him, whether it was that or not, the getting to it, Quentin thought, was taking a long time."
8150,4,"Meanwhile, as though in inverse ratio to the vanishing voice, the invoked ghost of the man whom she could neither forgive nor revenge herself upon began to assume a quality almost of solidity, permanence.Itself circumambient and enclosed by its effluvium of hell, its aura of unregeneration, it mused (mused, thought, seemed to possess sentience, as if, though dispossessed of the peace—who was impervious anyhow to fatigue—which she declined to give it, it was still irrevocably outside the scope of her hurt or harm) with that quality peaceful and now harmless and not even very attentive—the ogre-shape which, as Miss Coldfield's voice went on, resolved out of itself before Quentin's eyes the two half-ogre children, the three of them forming a shadowy background for the fourth one."
8151,4,"This was the mother, the dead sister Ellen: this Niobe without tears who had conceived to the demon in a kind of nightmare, who even while alive had moved but without life and grieved but without weeping, who—now had an air of tranquil and unwitting desolation, not is if she had either outlived the others or had died first, but as if she had never lived at all."
8152,4,"Quentin seemed to see them, the four of them arranged into-the conventional family group of the period, with formal and lifeless decorum, and seen now as the fading and ancient photograph itself would have been seen enlarged and hung on the wall behind and above the voice and of whose presence there the voice's owner was not even aware, as if she (Miss Coldfield) had never seen this room before—a picture, a group which even to Quentin had a quality strange, contradictory, and bizarre; not quite comprehensible, not (even to twenty) quite right—a group the last member of which had been dead twenty-five years and the first, fifty, evoked now out of the airless gloom of a dead house between an old woman's grim and implacable unforgiving and the passive chafing of a youth of twenty telling himself even amid the voice maybe you have to know anybody awful well to love them but when you have hated somebody for forty-three years you will know them awful well so maybe it's better then, maybe it's fine then because after forty-three years they cant any longer surprise you or make you either very contented or very mad."
8153,4,"And maybe it (the voice, the talking, the incredulous and unbearable amazement) had even been a cry aloud once, Quentin thought, long ago when she was a girl of young and indomitable unregret, of indictment of blind circumstance and savage event; but not now: now only the lonely thwarted old female flesh embattled for forty-three years in the old insult, the old unforgiving outraged and betrayed by the final and complete affront which was Sutpen's death: 'He wasn't a gentleman."
8154,4,He wasn't even a gentleman.
8155,4,"He came here with a horse and two pistols and a name which nobody ever heard before, knew for certain was his own any more than the horse was his own or even the pistols, seeking some place to hide himself, and Yoknapatawpha County supplied him with it."
8156,4,"He sought the guarantee of reputable men to barricade him from the other and later strangers who might come seeking him in turn, and Jefferson gave him that."
8157,4,"Then he needed respectability, the shield of a virtuous woman, to make his position impregnable even against the men who had given him protection on that inevitable day and hour when even they must rise against him in scorn and horror and outrage; and it was mine and Ellen's father who gave him that."
8158,4,"Oh, I hold no brief for Ellen: blind romantic fool who had only youth and inexperience to excuse her even if that; blind romantic fool, then later blind woman mother fool when she no longer had either youth or inexperience to excuse her, when she lay dying in that house for which she had exchanged pride and peace both and nobody there but the daughter who was already the same as a widow without ever having been a bride and was, three years later, to be a widow sure enough without having been anything at all, and the son who had repudiated the very roof under which he had been born and to which he would return but once more before disappearing for good, and that as a murderer and almost a fratricide; and he, fiend blackguard and devil, in Virginia fighting, where the chances of the earth's being rid of him were the best anywhere under the sun, yet Ellen and I both knowing that he would return, that every man in our armies would have to fall before bullet or ball found him; and only I, a child, a child, mind you, four years younger than the very niece I was asked to save, for Ellen to turn to and say, ""Protect her."
8159,4,"Protect Judith at least.""Yes, blind romantic fool, who did not even have that hundred miles of plantation which apparently moved our 'father nor that big house and the notion of slaves underfoot day and night which reconciled, I wont say moved, her aunt."
8160,4,"No: just the face of a man who contrived somehow to swagger even on a horse—a man who so far as anyone (including the father who was to give him a daughter in marriage) knew either had no past at all or did not dare reveal it—a man who rode into town out of nowhere with a horse and two pistols and a herd of wild beasts that he had hunted down singlehanded because he was stronger in fear than even they were in whatever heathen place he had fled from, and that French architect who looked like he had been hunted down and caught in turn by the Negroes—a man who fled here and hid, concealed himself behind respectability, behind that hundred miles of land which he took from a tribe of ignorant Indians, nobody knows how, and a house the size of a courthouse where he lived for three years without a window or door or bedstead in it and still called it Sutpen's Hundred as if it had been a king's grant in unbroken perpetuity from his great grandfather—a home, position: a wife and family which, being necessary: to concealment, he accepted along with the rest of respectability as he would have accepted the necessary discomfort and even pain of the briers and thorns in a thicket if the thicket could have given him the protection he sought."
8161,4,'No: not even a gentleman.
8162,4,Marrying Ellen or marrying ten thousand Ellens could not have made him one.
8163,4,"Not that he wanted to be one, or even be taken for one."
8164,4,No.
8165,4,"That was not necessary, since all he would need would be Ellen's and our father's names on a wedding license (or on any other patent of respectability) that people could look at and read just as he would have wanted our father's (or any other reputable man's) signature on a note of hand because our father knew who his father was in Tennessee and who his grandfather had been in Virginia and our neighbors and the people we lived among knew that we knew and we knew they knew we knew and we knew that they would have believed us about whom and where he came from even if we had lied, just as anyone could have looked at him once and known that he would be lying about who and where and why he came from by the very fact that apparently he had to refuse to say at all."
8166,4,—And the very fact that he had had to choose respectability to hide behind was proof enough (if anyone needed further proof) that what he fled from must have been some opposite of respectability too dark to talk about.Because he was too young.
8167,4,"He was just twenty-five and a man of twenty-five does not voluntarily undertake the hardship and privation of clearing virgin land and establishing a plantation in a new country just for money; not a young man without any past that he apparently cared to discuss, in Mississippi in 1833 with a river full of steamboats loaded with drunken fools covered with diamonds and bent on throwing away their cotton and slaves before the boat reached New Orleans—not with all this just one night's hard ride away and the only handicap or obstacle being the other blackguards or the risk of being put ashore on a sandbar, and at the remotest, a hemp rope."
8168,4,"And he was no younger son sent out from some old quiet country like Virginia or Carolina with the surplus Negroes to take up new land, because anyone could look at those Negroes of his and tell that they may have come (and probably did) from a much older country than Virginia or Carolina but it wasn't a quiet one."
8169,4,"And anyone could have looked once at his face and known that he would have chosen the river and even the certainty of the hemp rope, to undertaking what he undertook even if he had known that he would find gold buried and waiting for him in the very land which he had bought.'No."
8170,4,I hold no more brief for Ellen than I do for myself.
8171,4,"I hold even less for myself, because I had had twenty years in which to watch him, where Ellen had had but five."
8172,4,"And not even those five to see him but only to hear at second hand what he was doing, and not even to hear more than half of that, since apparently half of what he actually did during those five years nobody at all knew about, and half of the remainder no man would have repeated to a wife, let alone a young girl; he came here and set up a raree show which lasted five years and Jefferson paid him for the entertainment by at least shielding him to the extent of not telling their womenfolks what he was doing.But I had had all my life to watch him in, since apparently and for what reason Heaven has not seen fit to divulge, my life was destined to end on an afternoon in April forty-three years ago, since anyone who even had as little to call living as I had had up to that time would not call what I have had since living."
8173,4,"I saw what had happened to Ellen, my sister."
8174,4,"I saw her almost a recluse, watching those two doomed children growing up whom she was helpless to save."
8175,4,"I saw the price which she had paid' for that house and that pride; I saw the notes of hand on pride and contentment and peace and all to which she had put her signature when she walked into the church that night, begin to fall due in succession."
8176,4,"I saw Judith's marriage forbidden without rhyme or reason or shadow of excuse; I saw Ellen die with only me, a child, to turn to and ask to protect her remaining child; I saw Henry repudiate his home and birthright and then return and practically fling the bloody corpse of his sister's sweetheart at the hem of her wedding gown; I saw that man return the evil's source and head which had outlasted all its victims—who had created two children not only to destroy one another and his own line, but my line as well, yet I agreed to marry him.'No."
8177,4,I hold no brief for myself.
8178,4,"I don't plead youth, since what creature in the South since 1861, man woman nigger or mule, had had time or opportunity not only to have been young, but to have heard what being young was like from those who had."
8179,4,"I don't plead propinquity: the fact that I, a woman young and at the age for marrying and in a time when most of the young men whom I would have known ordinarily were dead on lost battlefields, that I lived for two years under the same roof with him."
8180,4,"I don't plead material necessity: the fact that, an orphan a woman and a pauper, I turned naturally not for protection but for actual food to my only kin: my dead sister's family: though I defy anyone to blame me, an orphan of twenty, a young woman without resources, who should desire not only to justify her situation but to vindicate the honor of a family the good name of whose women has never been impugned, by accepting the honorable proffer of marriage from the man whose food she was forced to subsist on."
8181,4,"And most of all, I do not plead myself: a young woman emerging from a holocaust which had taken parents security and all from her, who had seen all that living meant to her fall into ruins about the feet of a few figures with the shapes of men but with the names and statures of heroes—a young woman, I say, thrown into daily and hourly contact with one of these men who, despite what he might have been at one time and despite what she might have believed or even known about him, had fought for four honorable years for the soil and traditions of the land where she had been born.And the man who had done that, villain dyed though he be, would have possessed in her eyes, even if only from association with them, the stature and shape of a hero too, and now he also emerging from the same holocaust in which she had suffered, with nothing to face what the future held for the South but his bare hands and the sword which he at least had never surrendered and the citation for valor from his defeated Commander-in-Chief."
8182,4,"Oh, he was brave."
8183,4,I have never gainsaid that.
8184,4,"But that our cause, our very life and future hopes and past pride, should have been thrown into the balance with men like that to buttress it—men with valor and strength but without pity or honor.Is it any wonder that Heaven saw fit to let us lose?"" 'No'me,' Quentin said.'But that it should have been our father, mine and Ellen's father of all of them that he knew, out of all the ones who used to go out there and drink and gamble with him and watch him fight those wild Negroes, whose daughters he might even have won at cards."
8185,4,That it should have been our father.
8186,4,"How he could have approached papa, on what grounds; what there could have been besides the common civility of two men meeting on the street, between a man who came from nowhere or dared not tell where and our father; what there could have been between a man like that and papa—a Methodist steward, a merchant who was not rich and who not only could have done nothing under the sun to advance his fortunes or prospects but could by no stretch of the imagination even have owned anything that he would have wanted, even picked up in the road—a man who owned neither land nor slaves except two house servants whom he had freed as soon as he got them, bought them, who neither drank nor hunted nor gambled—what there could have been between a man who to my certain knowledge was never in a Jefferson church but three times in his life—the once when he first saw Ellen, the once when they rehearsed the wedding, the once when they performed it—a man that anyone could look at and see that, even if he apparently had none now, he was accustomed to having money and intended to have it again and would have no scruples about how he got it—that man to discover Ellen inside a church."
8187,4,"In church, mind you, as though there were a fatality and curse on our family and God Himself were seeing to it that it was performed and discharged to the last drop and dreg."
8188,4,"Yes, fatality and curse on the South and on our family as though because some ancestor of ours had elected to establish his descent in a land primed for fatality and already cursed with it, even if it had not rather been our family, our father's progenitors, who had incurred the curse long years before and had been coerced by Heaven into establishing itself in the land and the time already cursed."
8189,4,"So that even I, a child still too young to know more than that, though Ellen was my own sister and Henry and Judith my own nephew and niece, I was not even to go out there save when papa or my aunt was with me and that I was not to play with Henry and Judith at all except in the house (and not because I was four years younger than Judith and six years younger than Henry: wasn't it to me that Ellen turned before she died and said ""Protect them""?)—even I used to wonder what our father or his father could have done before he married our mother that Ellen and I would have to expiate and neither of us alone be sufficient; what crime committed that would leave our family cursed to be instruments not only for that man's destruction, but for our own."" 'Yessum,' Quentin said.'Yes,' the grim quiet voice said from beyond the unmoving triangle of dim lace; and now, among the musing and decorous wraiths Quentin seemed to watch resolving the figure of a little girl, in the prim skirts and pantalettes, the smooth prim decorous braids, of the dead time."
8190,4,"She seemed to stand, to lurk, behind the neat picket fence of a small, grimly middleclass yard or lawn, looking out upon the whatever ogre-world of that quiet village street with that air of children born too late into their parents' lives and doomed to contemplate all human behavior through the complex and needless follies of adults—an air Cassandralike and humorless and profoundly and sternly prophetic out of all proportion to the actual years even of a child who had never been young."
8191,4,' Because I was born too late.
8192,4,"I was born twenty-two years too late—a child to whom out of the overheard talk of adults my own sister's and my sister's children's faces had come to be like the faces in an ogre-tale between supper and bed long before I Was old enough or big enough to be permitted to play with them, yet to whom that sister must have to turn at the last when she lay dying, with one of the children vanished and doomed to be a murderer and the other doomed to be a widow before she had even been a bride, and say, ""Protect her, at least."
8193,4,"At least save Judith."" A child, yet whose child's vouchsafed instinct could make that reply which the mature wisdom of her elders apparently could not make: ""Protect her? From whom and from what? He has already given them life: he does not need to harm them further."
8194,4,"It is from themselves that they need protection."" ' It should have been later than it was; it should have been late, yet the yellow slashes of mote-palpitant sunlight were latticed no higher up the impalpable wall of gloom which separated them; the sun seemed hardly to have moved."
8195,4,"It (the talking, the telling) seemed (to him, to Quentin) to partake of that logic—and reason-flouting quality of a dream which the sleeper knows must have occurred, stillborn and complete, in a second, yet the very quality upon which it must depend to move the dreamer (verisimilitude) to credulity horror or pleasure or amazement—depends as completely upon a formal recognition of and acceptance of elapsed and yet-elapsing time as music or a printed tale."
8196,4,'Yes.
8197,4,I was born too late.
8198,4,"I was a child who was to remember those three faces (and his, too) as seen for the first time in the carriage on that first Sunday morning when this town finally realized that he had turned that road from Sutpen's Hundred in to the church into a race track."
8199,4,"I was three then, and doubtless I had seen them before; I must have."
8200,4,But I do not remember it.
8201,4,"I do not even remember ever having seen Ellen before that Sunday.It was as though the sister whom I had never laid eyes on, who before I was born had vanished into the stronghold of an ogre or a djinn, was now to return through a dispensation of one day only, to the world which she had quitted, and I a child' of three, waked early for the occasion, dressed and curled as if for Christmas, for an occasion more serious than Christmas even, since now and at last this ogre or djinn had agreed for the sake of the wife and the children to come to church, to permit them at least to approach the vicinity of salvation, to at least give Ellen one chance to struggle with him for those children's souls on a battleground where she could be supported not only by Heaven but by her own family and people of her own kind; yes, even for the moment submitting himself to redemption, or lacking that, at least chivalrous for the instant even though still unregenerate.That is what I expected."
8202,4,This is what I saw as I stood there before the church between papa and our aunt and waited for the carriage to arrive from the twelve-mile drive.
8203,4,"And though I must have seen Ellen and the children before this, this is the vision of my first sight of them which I shall carry to my grave: a glimpse like the forefront of a tornado, of the carriage and Ellen's high white face within it and the two replicas of his face in miniature flanking her, and on the front seat the face and teeth of the wild Negro who was driving, and he, his face exactly like the Negro's save for the teeth (this because of his beard, doubtless)—all in a thunder and a fury of wild-eyed horses and of galloping and of dust.'Oh, there were pleaty of them to abet him, assist him, make a race of it; ten o' clock on Sunday morning, the carriage racing on two wheels up to the very door to the church with that wild Negro in his Christian clothes looking exactly like a performing tiger in a linen duster and a top hat, and Ellen with no drop of blood in her face, holding those two children who were not crying and who did not need to be held, who sat on either side of her, perfectly Still too, with in their faces that infantile enormity which we did not then quite comprehend."
8204,4,"Oh, yes, there were plenty to aid and abet him; even he could not have held a horse race without someone to race against."
8205,4,"Because it was not even public opinion that stopped him, not even the men who might have had wives and children in carriages to be ridden down and into ditches: it was the minister himself, speaking in the name of the women of Jefferson and Yoknapatawpha County."
8206,4,"So he quit coming to church himself; now it would be just Ellen and the children in the carriage on Sunday morning, so we knew now that at least there would be no betting now, since no one could say if it was an actual race or not, since now, with his face absent, it was only the wild Negro's perfectly inscrutable one with the teeth glinting a little, so that now we could never know if it were a race or a runaway, and if there was triumph, it was on the face twelve miles back there at Sutpen's Hundred, which did not even require to see or be present."
8207,4,"It was the Negro now, who in the act of passing another carriage spoke to that team too as well as to his own—something without words, not needing words probably, in that tongue in which they slept in the mud of that swamp and brought here out of whatever dark swamp he had found them in and brought them here—the dust, the thunder, the carriage whirling up to the church door while women and children scattered and screamed before it and men caught at the bridles of the other team.And the Negro would let Ellen and the children out at the door and take the carriage on around to the hitching grove and beat the horses for running away; there was even a fool who tried to interfere once, whereupon the Negro turned upon him with the stick lifted and his teeth showing a little and said, ""Marster say; I do."
8208,4,"You tell Marster."" 'Yes."
8209,4,From them; from themselves.
8210,4,And this time it was not even the minister.
8211,4,It was Ellen.
8212,4,"Our aunt and papa were talking and I came in and my aunt said ""Go out and play"", though even if I could not have heard through the door at all, I could have repeated the conversation for them: ""Your daughter, your own daughter"" my aunt said; and papa: ""Yes."
8213,4,She is my daughter.
8214,4,"When she wants me to interfere she will tell me so herself."" Because this Sunday when Ellen and the children came out of the front door, it was not the carriage waiting, it was Ellen's phaeton with the old gentle mare which 'she drove and the stableboy that he had bought instead of the wild Negro."
8215,4,"And Judith looked once at the phaeton and realized what it meant and began to scream, screaming and kicking while they carried her back into the house and put her to bed."
8216,4,"No, he was not present."
8217,4,Nor do I claim a lurking triumphant face behind a window curtain.
8218,4,"Probably he would have been as amazed as we were since we would all realize now that we were faced by more than a child's tantrum or even hysteria: that his face had been in that carriage all the time; that it had been Judith, a girl of six, who had instigated and authorized that Negro to make the team run away."
8219,4,"Not Henry, mind; not the boy, which would have been outrageous enough; but Judith, the girl.'As soon as papa and I entered those gates that afternoon and began to go up the drive toward the house, I could feel it."
8220,4,"It was as though somewhere in that Sunday afternoon's quiet and peace the screams of that child still existed, lingered, not as sound now but as something for the skin to hear, the hair on the head to hear."
8221,4,But I did not ask at once.
8222,4,"I was just four then; I sat in the buggy beside papa as I had stood between him and our aunt before the church on that first Sunday when I had been dressed to come and see my sister and my nephew and niece for the first time, looking at the house."
8223,4,"I had been inside it before too, of course, but even when I saw it for the first time that I could remember I seemed already to know how it was going to look just as I seemed to know how Ellen and Judith and Henry would look before I saw them for the time which I always remember as being the first."
8224,4,"No, not asking even then, but just looking at that huge quiet house, saying ""What room is Judith sick in, papa?"" with that quiet aptitude of a child for accepting the inexplicable, though I now know that even then I was wondering what Judith saw when she came out the door and found the phaeton instead of the carriage, the tame stableboy instead of the wild man; what she had seen in that phaeton which looked so innocent to the rest of us or worse, what she had missed when she saw the phaeton and began to scream.Yes, a still hot quiet Sunday afternoon like this afternoon; I remember yet the utter quiet of that house when we went in and from which I knew at once that he was absent without knowing that he would now be in the scuppernong arbor drinking with Wash Jones."
8225,4,"I only knew, as soon as papa and I crossed the threshold, that he was not there: as though with some almost omniscient conviction, knowing that he did not need to stay and observe his triumph—and that, in comparison with what was to be, this one was a mere trivial business even beneath our notice too."
8226,4,"Yes, that quiet darkened room with the blinds closed and a Negro woman sitting beside the bed with a fan and Judith's white face on the pillow beneath a camphor cloth, asleep as I supposed then: possibly it was sleep, or would be called sleep: and Ellen's face white and calm and papa said ""Go out and find Henry and ask him to play with you, Rosa"" and so I stood just outside that quiet door in that quiet upper hall because I was afraid to go away even from it, because I could hear the sabbath afternoon quiet of that house louder than thunder, louder than laughing even with triumph.""""Think of the children,"" papa said.' ""Think?"" Ellen said."
8227,4,"""What else do I do? What else do I lie awake at night and do but think of them?"" Neither papa nor Ellen said: Come back home.No: This occurred before it became fashionable to repair your mistakes by turning your back on them and running."
8228,4,"It was just the two quiet voices beyond that blank door which might have been discussing something printed in a magazine; and I, a child standing close beside that door because I was afraid to be there but more afraid to leave it, standing motionless beside that door as though trying to make myself blend with the dark wood and become invisible, like a chameleon, listening to the living spirit, presence, of that house, since some of Ellen's life and breath had now gone into it as well as his, breathing away in a long neutral sound of victory and despair, of triumph and terror too.' ""Do you love this..."" papa said.' ""Papa,"" Ellen said."
8229,4,That was all.
8230,4,"But I could see her face then as clearly as papa could have, with that same expression which it had worn in the carriage on that first Sunday and the others."
8231,4,Then a servant came and said our buggy was ready.'Yes.
8232,4,From themselves.
8233,4,"Not from him, not from anybody, just as nobody could have saved them, even himself."
8234,4,Because he now showed us why that triumph had been beneath his notice.
8235,4,"He showed Ellen, that is: not me."
8236,4,"I was not there; it was six yeas now, during which I had scarcely seen him."
8237,4,Our aunt was gone now and I was keeping house for papa.
8238,4,"Perhaps once a year papa and I would go out there and have dinner, and maybe four times a year Ellen and the children would come in and spend the day with us."
8239,4,"Not he; that I know of, he never entered this house again after he and Ellen married."
8240,4,"I was young then; I was even young enough to believe that this was due to some stubborn coal of conscience, if not remorse, even in him."
8241,4,"But I know better now I know now that it was simply because since papa had: given him respectability through a wife there was nothing else he could want from papa and so not even sheer gratitude, let alone appearances, could force him to forgo his own pleasure to the extent of taking a family meal with his wife's people."
8242,4,So I saw little of them.
8243,4,"I did not have time now to play, even if I had ever had any inclination."
8244,4,I had never learned how and I saw no reason to try to learn now even if I had had the time.
8245,4,"' So it was six years now, though it was actually no secret to Ellen since it had apparently been going on ever since he drove the last nail in the house, the only difference between now and the time of his bachelorhood being that now they would hitch the teams and saddle horses and mules in' the grove beyond the stable and so come up across the pasture unseen from the house."
8246,4,"Because there were plenty of them still; it was as if God or the devil had taken advantage of his very vices in order to supply witnesses to the discharge of our curse not only from among gentlefolks, our own kind, but from the very scum and riffraff who could not have approached the house itself under any other circumstances, not even from the rear."
8247,4,"Yes, Ellen and those two children alone in that house twelve miles from town, and down there in the stable a hollow square of faces in the lantern light, the white faces on three sides, the black ones on the fourth, and in the center two of his wild Negroes fighting, naked, fighting not as white men fight, with rules and weapons, but as Negroes fight to hurt one another quick and bad, Ellen knew that, or thought she did; that was not it.She accepted that—not reconciled: accepted—as though there is a breathing-point in outrage where you can accept it almost with gratitude since you can say to yourself, thank God, this is all; at least I now know all of it—thinking that, clinging still to that when she ran into the stable that night while the very men who had stolen into it from the rear fell back away from her with at least some grain of decency, and Ellen seeing not the two black beasts she had expected to see but instead a white one and a black one, both naked to the waist and gouging at one another's eyes as if they should not only have been the same color, but should have been covered with fur too.Yes."
8248,4,"It seems that on certain occasions, perhaps at the end of the evening, the spectacle, as a grand finale or perhaps as a matter of sheer deadly forethought toward the retention of supremacy, domination, he would enter the ring with one of the Negroes himself."
8249,4,"Yes.That's what Ellen saw: her husband and the father of her children standing there naked and panting and bloody to the waist and the Negro just fallen evidently, lying at his feet and bloody too, save that on the Negro it merely looked like grease or sweat—Ellen running down the hill from the house, bareheaded, in time to hear the sound, the screaming, hearing it while she still ran in the darkness and before the spectators knew that she was there, hearing it even before it occurred to one spectator to say, ""It's a horse"" then ""It's a woman"" then ""My God, it's a child"" —ran in, and the spectators falling back to permit her to see Henry plunge out from among the Negroes who had been holding him, screaming and vomiting—not pausing, not even looking at the faces which shrank back away from her as she knelt in the stable filth to raise Henry and not looking at Henry either but up at him as he stood there with even his teeth showing beneath his beard now and another Negro wiping the blood from his body with a towsack.""I know you will excuse us, gentlemen,"" Ellen said."
8250,4,"But they were already departing, nigger and white, slinking out again as they had slunk in, and Ellen not watching them now either but kneeling in the dirt while Henry clung to her, crying, and he standing there yet while a third nigger prodded his shirt or coat at him as though the coat were a stick and he a caged snake."
8251,4,"""Where is Judith, Thomas?"" Ellen said.' ""Judith?"" he said."
8252,4,"Oh, he was not lying; his own triumph had outrun him; he had builded even better in evil than even he could have hoped."
8253,4,"""Judith? Isn't she in bed?""' ""Dont lie to me, Thomas,"" Ellen said."
8254,4,"""I can understand your bringing Henry here to see this, wanting Henry to see this; I will try to understand it; yes, I will make myself try to understand it."
8255,4,"But not Judith, Thomas."
8256,4,"Not my baby girl, Thomas.""' ""I don't expect you to understand it,"" he said."
8257,4,"""Because you are a woman.But I didn't bring Judith down here."
8258,4,I would not bring her down here.
8259,4,I don't expect you to believe that.
8260,4,"But I swear to it.""'""I wish I could believe you,"" Ellen said."
8261,4,"""I want to believe you."" Then she began to call."
8262,4,"""Judith!"" she called in a voice calm and sweet and filled with despair: ""Judith honey! Time to come to bed.""'But I was not there."
8263,4,"I was not there to see the two Sutpen faces this time—once on Judith and once on the Negro girl beside her looking down through the square entrance to the loft.""—2—It was a summer of wistaria."
8264,4,"The twilight was full of it and of the smell of his father's cigar as they sat on the front gallery' after supper until it would be time for Quentin to start, while in the deep shaggy lawn below the veranda the fireflies blew and drifted in soft random—the odor, the scent, which five months later Mr Compson's letter would carry up from Mississippi and over the long iron New England snow and into Quentin's sitting-room at Harvard."
8265,4,"It was a day of listening too—the listening, the hearing in 1909 mostly about that which he already knew, since he had been born in and still breathed the same air in which the church bells had rung on that Sunday morning in 1833 and, on Sundays, heard even one of the original three bells in the same steeple where descendants of the same pigeons strutted and crooned or wheeled in short courses resembling soft fluid paint-smears on the soft summer sky.That Sunday morning in June with the bells ringing peaceful and peremptory and a little cacophonous—the denominations in concord though not in tune—and the ladies and children, and house Negroes to carry the parasols and flywhisks, and even a few men (the ladies moving in hoops among the miniature broadcloth of little boys and the pantalettes of little girls, in the skirts of the time when ladies did not walk but floated) when the other men sitting with their feet on the railing of the Holston House gallery looked up, and there the stranger was."
8266,4,"He was already halfway across the Square when they saw him, on a big hardridden roan horse, man and beast looking as though they had been created out of thin air and set down in the bright summer sabbath sunshine in the middle of a tired foxtrot face and horse that none of them had ever seen before, name that none of them had ever heard, and origin and purpose which some of them were never to learn."
8267,4,"So that in the next four weeks (Jefferson was a village then: the Holston House, the courthouse, six stores, a blacksmith and livery stable, a saloon frequented by drovers and peddlers, three churches and perhaps thirty residences) the stranger's name went back and forth among the places of business and of idleness and among the residences in steady strophe and antistrophe: Sutpen."
8268,4,Sutpen.
8269,4,Sutpen.
8270,4,Sutpen.That was all that the town was to know about him for almost a month.
8271,4,"He had apparently come into town from the South—a man of about twenty-five as the town learned later, because at the time his age could not have been guessed his age could not have been guessed because he looked like a man who had been sick."" Not like a man who had been peacefully ill in bed and had recovered to move with a sort of diffident and tentative amazement in a world which he had believed himself on the point of surrendering, but like a man who had been through some solitary furnace experience which was more than just fever, like an explorer ay, who not only had to face the normal hardship of the pursuit which he chose but was overtaken by the added and unforeseen handicap of the fever also and fought through it at enormous cost not so much physical as 'mental, alone and unaided and not through blind instinctive will to endure and survive but to gain and keep to enjoy it the material prize for which he accepted the original gambit."
8272,4,"A man with a big frame but gaunt now almost to emaciation, with a short reddish beard which resembled a disguise and above which his pale eyes had a quality at once visionary and alert, ruthless and reposed in a face whose flesh had the appearance of pottery, of having been colored by that oven's fever either of soul or environment, deeper than sun alone beneath a dead impervious surface as of glazed clay."
8273,4,"That was what they saw,' though it was years before the town learned that that was all which he possessed at the time—the strong spent horse and the clothes on his back and a small saddlebag scarcely large enough to contain the spare linen and the razors, and the two pistols of which Miss Coldfield told Quentin, with the butts worn smooth as pickhandles and which he used with the precision of knitting needles; later Quentin's grandfather saw him ride at a canter around a sapling at twenty feet and put both bullets into a playing card fastened to the tree."
8274,4,"He had a room in the Holston House but he carried the key with him and each morning he fed and saddled the horse and rode away before daylight, where to the town likewise failed to learn, probably due to the fact that he bore the pistol demonstration on the third day after his arrival."
8275,4,"So they had to depend on inquiry to find out what they told about him, which would of necessity be at night, at the supper table in the Holston House dining-room or in the lounge which he would have to cross to gain his room and lock the door again, which he would do as soon as he finished eating."
8276,4,"The bar opened into the lounge too, and that would or should have been the place to accost him and even inquire, except for the fact that he did not use the bar."
8277,4,"He did not drink at all, he told them."
8278,4,"He did not say that he used to drink and had quit, nor that he had never used alcohol."
8279,4,"He just said that he would not care for a drink; it was years later before even Quentin's grandfather (he was a young man too then; it would be years yet before he would become General Compson) learned that the reason Sutpen did not drink was that he did not have the money with which to pay his share or return the courtesy; it was General Compson who first realized that at this time Sutpen lacked not only the money to spend for drink and conviviality, but the time and inclination as well: that he was at this time completely the slave of his secret and furious impatience, his conviction gained from whatever that recent experience had been—that fever mental or physical—of a need for haste, of time fleeing beneath him, which was to drive him for the next five years—as General Compson computed it, roughly until about nine months before his son was born."
8280,4,"So they would catch him, run him to earth, in the lounge between the supper table and his locked door to give him the opportunity to tell them who he was and where he came from and what he was up to, whereupon he would move gradually and steadily until his back came in contact with something—a post or a wall—and then stand there and tell them nothing whatever as pleasantly and courteously as a hotel clerk."
8281,4,"It was the Chickasaw Indian agent with or through whom he dealt and so it was not until he waked the County Recorder that Saturday night with the deed, patent, to the land and the gold Spanish coin, that the town learned that he now owned a hundred square miles of some of the best virgin bottom land in the country, though even that knowledge came too late because Sutpen himself was gone, where to again they did not know."
8282,4,But he owned land among them now and some of them began to suspect what General Compson apparently knew: that the Spanish coin with which he had paid to have his patent recorded was the last one of any kind which he possessed.
8283,4,"So they were certain now that he had departed to get more; there were several who even anticipated in believing (and even in saying aloud, now that he was not present) what Sutpen's future and then unborn sister-in-law was to tell Quentin almost eighty years later: that he had found some unique and practical way of hiding loot and that he had returned to the cache to replenish his pockets, even if he had not actually ridden with the two pistols back to the River and the steamboats full of gamblers and cotton and slave-dealers to replenish the cache."
8284,4,"At least some of them were telling one another that when two months later he returned, again without warning and accompanied this time by the covered wagon with a Negro driving it and on the seat with the Negro a small, alertly resigned man with a grim, harried Latin face, in a frock coat and a flowered waistcoat and a hat which would have created no furore on a Paris boulevard, all of which he was to wear constantly for the next two years—the somberly theatric clothing and the expression of fatalistic and amazed determination—while his white client and the Negro crew which he was to advise though not direct went stark naked save for a coating of dried mud."
8285,4,This was the French architect.
8286,4,"Years later the town learned that he had come all the way from Martinique on Sutpen's bare promise and lived for two years on venison cooked over a campfire, in an unfloored tent made of the wagon hood, before he so much as saw any color or shape of pay."
8287,4,"And until he passed through town on his way back to New Orleans two years later, he was not even to see Jefferson again; he would not come, or Sutpen would not bring him, to town even on the few occasions when Sutpen would be seen there, and he did not have much chance to look at Jefferson on that first day because the wagon did not stop."
8288,4,"Apparently it was only by sheer geographical hap that Sutpen passed through town at all, pausing only long enough for someone (not General Compson) to look beneath the wagon hood and into a black tunnel filled with still eyeballs and smelling like a wolfden.But the legend of Sutpen's wild Negroes was not to begin at once, because the wagon went on as though even the wood and iron which composed it, as well as the mules which drew it, had become imbued by sheer association with him with that quality of gaunt and tireless driving, that conviction for haste and of fleeing time; later Sutpen told Quentin's grandfather that on that afternoon when the wagon passed through Jefferson they had been without food since the previous night and that he was trying to reach Sutpen's Hundred and the river bottom to try to kill a deer before dark, so he and the architect and the Negroes would not have to spend another night without food."
8289,4,"So the legend of the wild men came gradually back to town, brought by the men who would ride out to watch what was going on, who began to tell how Sutpen would take stand beside a game trail with the pistols and send the Negroes in to drive the swamp like a pack of hounds; it was they who told how during that first summer and fall the Negroes did not even have (or did not use) blankets to sleep in, even before the coon-hunter Akers claimed to have walked one of them out of the absolute mud like a sleeping alligator and Screamed just in time."
8290,4,The Negroes could speak no English yet and doubtless there were more than Akers who did not know that the language in which they and Sutpen communicated was a sort of French and not some dark and fatal tongue of their own.
8291,4,"There were many more than Akers, though the others were responsible citizens and landowners and so did not have to lurk about the camp at night.In fact, as Miss Coldfield told Quentin, they would make up parties to meet at the Holston House and go out horseback, often carrying lunch."
8292,4,"Sutpen had built a brick kiln and he had set up the saw and planer which he had brought in the wagon—a capstan with a long sapling walking-beam, with the wagon team and the Negroes in shifts and himself too when necessary, when the machinery slowed, hitched to it—as if the Negroes actually were wild men; as General Compson told his son, Quentin's father, while the Negroes were working Sutpen never raised his voice at them, that instead he led them, caught them at the psychological instant by example, by some ascendancy of forbearance rather than by brute fear."
8293,4,"Without dismounting (usually Sutpen did not even greet them with as much as a nod, apparently as unaware of their presence as if they had been idle shades) they would sit in a curious quiet clump as though for mutual protection and watch his mansion rise, carried plank by plank and brick by brick out of the swamp where the clay and timber waited—the bearded white man and the twenty black ones and all stark naked beneath the croaching and pervading mud."
8294,4,"Being men, these spectators did not realize that the garments which Sutpen had worn when he first rode into Jefferson were the only ones in which they had ever seen him, and few of the women in the county had seen him at all."
8295,4,"Otherwise, some of them would have anticipated Miss Coldfield in this too: in divining that he was saving his clothes, since decorum even if not elegance of appearance would be the only weapon (or rather, ladder) with which he could conduct the last assault upon what Miss Coldfield and perhaps others believed to be respectability that respectability which, according to General Compson, consisted in Sutpen's secret mind of a great deal more than the mere acquisition of a chatelaine for his house."
8296,4,"So he and the twenty Negroes worked together, plastered over with mud against the mosquitoes and, as Miss Coldfield told Quentin, distinguishable one from another by his beard and eyes alone and only the architect resembling a human creature because of the French clothes which he wore constantly with a sort of invincible fatality until the day after the house was completed save for the windowglass and the ironware which they could not make by hand and the architect departed—working in the sun and heat of summer and the mud and ice of winter, with quiet and unflagging fury.It took him two years, he and his crew of imported slaves which his adopted fellow citizens still looked on as being a good deal more deadly than any beast he could have started and slain in that country.They worked from sunup to sundown while parties of horsemen rode up and sat their horses quietly and watched, and the architect in his formal coat and his Paris hat and his expression of grim and embittered amazement lurked about the environs of the scene with his air something between a casual and bitterly disinterested spectator and a condemned and conscientious ghost—amazement, General Compson said, not at the others and what they were doing so much as at himself, at the inexplicable and incredible fact of his own presence."
8297,4,"But he was a good architect; Quentin knew the house, twelve miles from Jefferson, in its grove of cedar and oak, seventy-five years after it was finished.And not only an architect as General Compson said, but an artist since only an artist could have borne those two years in order to build a house which he doubtless not only expected but firmly intended never to see again."
8298,4,"Not, General Compson said, the hardship to sense and the outrage to sensibility of the two years' sojourn, but Sutpen: that only an artist could have borne Sutpen's ruthlessness and hurry and still manage to curb the dream of grim and castlelike magnificence at which Sutpen obviously aimed, since the place as Sutpen planned it would have been almost as large as Jefferson itself at the time; that the little grim harried foreigner had singlehanded given battle to and vanquished Sutpen's fierce and overweening vanity or desire for magnificence or for vindication or whatever it was (even General Compson did not know yet) and so created of Sutpen's very defeat the victory which, in conquering, Sutpen himself would have failed to gain."
8299,4,"So it was finished then, down to the last plank and brick and wooden pin which they could make themselves."
8300,4,"Unpainted and unfurnished, without a pane of glass or a doorknob or hinge in it, twelve miles from town and almost that far from any neighbor, it stood for three years more surrounded by its formal gardens and promenades, its slave quarters and stables and smokehouses; wild turkey ranged within a mile of the house and deer came light and colored like smoke and left delicate prints in the formal beds where there would be no flowers for four years yet."
8301,4,"Now there began a period, a phase, during which the town and the county watched him with more puzzlement yet.Perhaps it was because the next step toward that secret end which General Compson claimed to have known but which the town and the county comprehended but dimly or not at all, now required patience or passive time instead of that driving fury to which he had accustomed them; now it was the women who first suspected what he wanted, what the next step would be."
8302,4,"None of the men, certainly not those who knew him well enough to call him by name, suspected that he wanted a wife."
8303,4,"Doubtless there were some of them, husbands and bachelors both, who not only would have refused to entertain the idea but would even have protested against it, because for the next three years he led what must have been to them a perfect existence."
8304,4,"He lived out there, eight miles from any neighbor, in masculine solitude in what might be called the halfacre gunroom of a baronial splendor."
8305,4,"He lived in the Spartan shell of the largest edifice in the county, not excepting the courthouse itself, whose threshold no woman had so much as seen, without any feminized softness of window-pane or door or mattress; where there was not only no woman to object if he should elect to have his dogs in to sleep on the pallet bed with him, he did not even need dogs to kill the game which left footprints within sight of the kitchen door but hunted it instead with human beings who belonged to him body and soul and of whom it was believed (or said) that they could creep up to a bedded buck and cut its throat before it could move.It was at this time that he began to invite the parties of men of which Miss Coldfield told Quentin, out to Sutpen's Hundred to camp in blankets in the naked rooms of his embryonic formal opulence; they hunted, and at night played cards and drank, and on occasion he doubtless pitted his Negroes against one another and perhaps even at this time participated now and then himself-that spectacle which, according to Miss Coldfield, his son was unable to bear the sight of while his daughter looked on unmoved."
8306,4,"Sutpen drank himself now, though there were probably others besides Quentin's grandfather who remarked that he drank very sparingly save when he himself had managed to supply some of the liquor."
8307,4,"His guests would bring whiskey out with them but he drank of this with a sort of sparing calculation as though keeping mentally, General Compson said, a sort of balance of spiritual solvency between the amount of whiskey he accepted and the amount of running meat which he supplied to the guns.He lived like that for three years."
8308,4,"He now had a plantation; inside of two years he had dragged house and gardens out of virgin swamp, and plowed and planted his land with seed cotton which General Compson loaned him."
8309,4,Then he seemed to quit.
8310,4,"He seemed to just sit down in the middle of what he had almost finished, and to remain so for three years during which he did not even appear to intend or want anything more."
8311,4,"Perhaps it is not to be wondered at that the men in the county came to believe that the life he now led had been his aim all the time; it was General Compson, who seemed to have known him well enough to offer to lend him seed cotton for his start, who knew any better, to whom Sutpen ever told anything about his past."
8312,4,"It was General Compson who knew first about the Spanish coin being his last one, as it was Compson (so the town learned later) who offered to lend Sutpen the money to finish and furnish his house, and was refused."
8313,4,"So doubtless General Compson was the first man in the county to tell himself that Sutpen did not need to borrow money with which to complete the house, supply what it yet lacked, because he intended to marry."
8314,4,"Not the first person to know: rather the first man, since, according to what Miss Coldfield told Quentin seventy-five years later, the women in the county had been telling one another and their husbands as well that Sutpen did not intend to quit there, that he had already gone to too much trouble, gone through too much privation and hardship to settle down and live exactly as he had lived While the house was being built save that now he had a roof to sleep under in place of an unfloored wagon hood."
8315,4,"Probably the women had already cast about among the families of the men who might now be called his friends, for that prospective bride whose dowry might complete the shape and substance of that respectability Miss Coldfield anyway believed to be his aim.So when, at the expiration of this second phase, three years after the house was finished and the architect departed, and again on Sunday morning and again without warning, the town saw him cross the square, on foot now but in the same garments in which he had ridden into town five years ago and which no one had seen since (he or one of the Negroes had ironed the coat with heated bricks, General Compson told Quentin's father) and enter the Methodist church, only some of the men were surprised."
8316,4,The women merely said that he had exhausted the possibilities of the families of the men with whom he had hunted and gambled and that he had now come to town to find a wife exactly as he would have gone to the Memphis market to buy livestock or slaves.
8317,4,"But when they comprehended whom it was that he had apparently come to town and into church to invest with his choice, the assurance of the women became one with the men's surprise, and then even more than that: amazement.Because the town now believed that it knew him."
8318,4,"For two years it had watched him as with that grim and unflagging fury he had erected that shell of a house and laid out his fields, then for three years he had remained completely static, as if he were run by electricity and someone had come along and removed, dismantled the wiring or the dynamo."
8319,4,"So that when he entered the Methodist church that Sunday morning in his ironed coat, there were men as well as women who believed that they had only to look around the congregation in order to anticipate the direction his feet would take him, until they became aware that he had apparently marked down Miss Coldfield's father with the same cold and ruthless deliberation with which he had probably marked down the French architect."
8320,4,"They watched in shocked amazement while he laid deliberate siege to the one man in the town with whom he could have had nothing in common, least of all, money—a man who obviously could do nothing under the sun for him save give him credit at a little cross-roads store or cast a vote in his favor if he should ever seek ordination as a Methodist minister—a Methodist steward, a merchant not only of modest position and circumstances but who already had a wife and family of his own, let alone a dependent mother and sister, to support out of the proceeds of a business which he had brought to Jefferson ten years ago in a single wagon—a man with a name for absolute and undeviating and even Puritan uprightness in a country and time of lawless opportunity, who neither drank nor gambled nor even hunted."
8321,4,In their surprise they forgot that Mr Coldfield had a marriageable daughter.
8322,4,They did not consider the daughter at all.
8323,4,They did not think of love in connection with Sutpen.
8324,4,"They thought of ruthlessness rather than justice and of fear rather than respect, but not of pity or love: besides being too lost in amazed speculation as to just how Sutpen intended or could contrive to use Mr Coldfield to further whatever secret ends he still had."
8325,4,They were never to know: even Miss Rosa Coldfield did not.
8326,4,"Because from that day there were no more hunting parties out at Sutpen's Hundred, and when they saw him now it would be in town."
8327,4,"But not loafing, idling."
8328,4,"The men who had slept and matched glasses with him under his roof (some of them had even come to call him Sutpen without the formal Mister) watched him pass along the street before the Holston House with a single formal gesture to his hat and go on and enter Mr Coldfield's store, and that was all.'Then one day he quitted Jefferson for the second time,' Mr Compson told Quentin."
8329,4,'The town should have been accustomed to that by now.
8330,4,"Nevertheless, his position had subtly changed, as you will see by the town's reaction to this second return."
8331,4,"Because when he came back this time, he was in a sense a public enemy."
8332,4,"Perhaps this was because of what he brought back with him this time: the material he brought back this time, as compared to the simple wagonload of wild niggers which he had brought back before."
8333,4,But I don't think so.
8334,4,"That is, I think it was a little more involved than the sheer value of his chandeliers and mahogany and rugs."
8335,4,"I think that the affront was born of the town's realization that he was getting it involved with himself; that whatever the felony which produced the mahogany and crystal, he was forcing the town to compound it."
8336,4,"Heretofore, until that Sunday when he came ' to church, if he had misused or injured anybody, it was only old Ikkemotubbe, from whom he got his land—a matter between his conscience and Uncle Sam and God."
8337,4,"But now his position had changed, because when, about three months after he departed, four wagons left Jefferson to go to the River and meet him, it was known that Mr Coldfield was the man who hired and dispatched them."
8338,4,"They were big wagons, drawn by oxen, and when they returned the town looked at them and knew, no matter what they might have contained, that Mr Coldfield could not have mortgaged everything that he owned for enough to fill them; doubtless this time there were more men than women even who pictured him during this absence with a handkerchief over his face and the two pistol barrels glinting beneath the candelabra of a steamboat's saloon, even if no worse: if not something performed in the lurking dark of a muddy landing and with a knife from behind."
8339,4,"They saw him pass, on the roan horse beside his four wagons; it seems that even the ones who had eaten his food and shot his game and even called him ""Sutpen"" without the ""Mister"", didn't accost him now."
8340,4,"They just waited while reports and rumors came back to town of how he and his now somewhat tamed Negroes had installed the windows and doors and the spits and pots in the kitchen and the crystal chandeliers in the parlors and the furniture and the curtains and the rugs; it was that same Akers who had blundered onto the mudcouched Negro five years ago who came, a little wild-eyed and considerably slack-mouthed, into the Holston House bar one evening and said, ""Boys, this time he stole the whole durn steamboat!""'So at last civic virtue came to a boil."
8341,4,"One day and with the sheriff of the county among them, a party of eight or ten took the road out to Sutpen's Hundred."
8342,4,They did not go all the way because about six miles from town they met Sutpen himself.
8343,4,"He was riding the roan horse, in the frock coat and the beaver hat which they knew and with his legs wrapped in a piece of tarpaulin; he had a portmanteau on his pommel and he was carrying a small woven basket on his arm."
8344,4,"He stopped the roan (it was April then, and the road was still a quagmire) and sat there in his splashed tarpaulin and looked from one face to the next; your grandfather said that his eyes looked like pieces of a broken plate and that his beard was strong as a curry-comb."
8345,4,That was how he put it: strong as a curry-comb.
8346,4,"""Good morning, gentlemen,"" he said."
8347,4,"""Were you looking for me?"" 'Doubtless something more than this transpired at the time, though none of the vigilance committee ever told it that I know of."
8348,4,"All I ever heard is how the town, the men on the gallery of the Holston House saw Sutpen and the committee ride onto the square together, Sutpen a little in front and the others bunched behind him—Sutpen with his legs and feet wrapped neatly in his tarpaulin and his shoulders squared inside the worn broadcloth coat and that worn brushed beaver cocked a little, talking to them over his shoulder and those eyes hard and pale and reckless and probably quizzical and maybe contemptuous even then.He pulled up at the door and the Negro hostler ducked out and took the roan's head and Sutpen got down, with his portmanteau and the basket and mounted the steps, and I heard how he turned there kind looked at them again where they huddled on their horses, not knowing what to do exactly."
8349,4,And it might have been a good thing that he had that beard and they could not see his mouth.
8350,4,"Then he turned, and he looked at the other men sitting with their feet on the railing and watching him too, men who used to come out to his place and sleep on the floor and hunt with him, and he saluted them with that florid, swaggering gesture to the hat (yes, he was underbred."
8351,4,"It showed like this always, your grandfather said, in all his formal contacts with people."
8352,4,He was like John L.
8353,4,"Sullivan having taught himself painfully and tediously to do the schottische, having drilled himself and drilled himself in secret until he now believed it no longer necessary to count the music's beat, say."
8354,4,"He may have believed that your grandfather or Judge Benbow might have done it a little more effortlessly than he, but he would not have believed that anyone could have beat him in knowing when to do it and how."
8355,4,"And besides, it was in his face; that was where his power lay, your grandfather said: that anyone could look at him and say, Given the occasion and the need, this man can and will do anything)."
8356,4,Then he went on into the house and commanded a chamber.
8357,4,'So they sat on their horses and waited for him.
8358,4,I suppose they knew that he would have to come out some time: I suppose they sat there and thought about those two pistols.
8359,4,"Because there was still no warrant for him, you see: it was just public opinion in an acute state of indigestion; and now other horsemen rode into the square and became aware of the situation, so that there was quite a posse waiting when he walked out onto the gallery."
8360,4,"He wore a new hat now, and a new broadcloth coat, so they knew what the portmanteau had contained."
8361,4,They even knew now what the.
8362,4,"Through the fence, between the curling flower spaces, I could see them hitting."
8363,4,They were coming toward where the flag was and I went along the fence.
8364,4,Luster was hunting in the grass by the flower tree.
8365,4,"They took the flag out, and they were hitting."
8366,4,"Then they put the flag back and they went to the table, and he hit and the other hit."
8367,4,"Then they went on, and I went along the fence."
8368,4,"Luster came away from the flower tree and we went along the fence and they stopped and we stopped and I looked through the fence while Luster was hunting in the grass.""Here, caddie."" He hit."
8369,4,They went away across the pasture.
8370,4,"I held to the fence and watched them going away.""Listen at you, now."" Luster said."
8371,4,"""Aint you something, thirty three years old, going on that way."
8372,4,After I done went all the way to town to buy you that cake.
8373,4,Hush up that moaning.
8374,4,"Aint you going to help me find that quarter so I can go to the show tonight.""They were hitting little, across the pasture."
8375,4,I went back along the fence to where the flag was.
8376,4,"It flapped on the bright grass and the trees.""Come on."" Luster said."
8377,4,"""We done looked there."
8378,4,They aint no more coming right now.
8379,4,"Les go down to the branch and find that quarter before them niggers finds it.""It was red, flapping on the pasture."
8380,4,Then there was a bird slanting and tilting on it.
8381,4,Luster threw.
8382,4,The flag flapped on the bright grass and the trees.
8383,4,"I held to the fence.""Shut up that moaning."" Luster said."
8384,4,"""I cant make them come if they aint coming, can I."
8385,4,"If you dont hush up, mammy aint going to have no birthday for you."
8386,4,"If you dont hush, you know what I going to do."
8387,4,I going to eat that cake all up.
8388,4,"Eat them candles, too."
8389,4,Eat all them thirty three candles.
8390,4,"Come on, les go down to the branch."
8391,4,I got to find my quarter.
8392,4,Maybe we can find one of they balls.
8393,4,Here.
8394,4,Here they is.
8395,4,Way over yonder.
8396,4,"See."" He came to the fence and pointed his arm."
8397,4,"""See them."
8398,4,They aint coming back here no more.

8403,4,"Cant you never crawl through here without snagging on that nail.""4.1Caddy uncaught me and we crawled through."
8404,4,"Uncle Maury said to not let anybody see us, so we better stoop over, Caddy said."
8405,4,"Stoop over, Benjy."
8406,4,"Like this, see."
8407,4,"We stooped over and crossed the garden, where the flowers rasped and rattled against us."
8408,4,The ground was hard.
8409,4,"We climbed the fence, where the pigs were grunting and snuffing."
8410,4,"I expect they're sorry because one of them got killed today, Caddy said."
8411,4,"The ground was hard, churned and knotted."

8585,4,"I could hear Qucenie's feet and the bright shapes went smooth and steady on both sides, the shadows of them flowing across Queenie's back."
8586,4,They went on like the bright tops of wheels.
8587,4,Then those on one side stopped at the tall white post where the soldier was.
8588,4,"But on the other side they went on smooth and steady, but a little slower.""What do you want."" Jason said."
8589,4,"He had his hands in his pockets and a pencil behind his ear.""We're going to the cemetery."" Mother said.""All right."" Jason said."
8590,4,"""I dont aim to stop you, do I."

8604,4,"I'll be gone soon, and then you """"Go on, T.P."" Jason said.""Hum up, Queenie."" T.P."
8605,4,said.
8606,4,The shapes flowed on.
8607,4,"The ones on thc other side began again, bright and fast and smooth, like when Caddy says we are going to sleep.19.4Cry baby, Luster said."
8608,4,Aint you shamed.
8609,4,We went through the barn.
8610,4,The stalls were all open.
8611,4,"You aint got no spotted pony to ride now, Luster said."
8612,4,The floor was dry and dusty.
8613,4,The roof was falling.
8614,4,The slanting holes were full of spinning yellow.
8615,4,"What do you want to go that way, for."
8616,4,"You want to get your head knocked off with one of them balls.4.2“Keep your hands in your pockets."" Caddy said."
8617,4,"""Or they'll be froze."
8618,4,"You dont want your hands froze on Christmas, do you.""We went around the barn."
8619,4,"The big cow and the little one were standing in the door, and we could hear Prince and Queenie and Fancy stomping inside the barn."
8620,4,"""If it wasn't so cold, we'd ride Fancy."" Caddy said."
8621,4,"""But it's too cold to hold on today."" Then we could seethe branch, where the smoke was blowing."
8622,4,"""That's where they are killing the pig."" Caddy said."
8623,4,"""We can come back by there and see them."" We went down the hill.""You want to carry the letter."" Caddy said."
8624,4,"""You can carry it."" She took the letter out of her pocket and put it in mine."
8625,4,"""It's a Christmas present."" Caddy said."
8626,4,"""Uncle Maury is going to surprise Mrs Patterson with it."
8627,4,We got to give it to her without letting anybody see it.
8628,4,"Keep your hands in your pockets good, now."" We came to the branch.""It's froze."" Caddy said."
8629,4,"""Look."" She broke the top of the water and held a piece of it against my face."
8630,4,"""Ice."
8631,4,"That means how cold it is."" She helped me across and we went up the hill."
8632,4,"""We cant even tell Mother and Father."
8633,4,You know what I think it is.
8634,4,"I think it's a surprise for Mother and Father and Mr Patterson both, because Mr Patterson sent you some candy."
8635,4,Do you remember when Mr Patterson sent you some candy last summer.There was a fence.
8636,4,"The vine was dry, and the wind rattled in it.""Only I dont see why Uncle Maury didn't send Versh."" Caddy said."
8637,4,"""Versh wont tell."" Mrs Patterson was looking out the window."
8638,4,"""You wait here."" Caddy said."
8639,4,"""Wait right here, now."
8640,4,I'll be back in a minute.
8641,4,"Give me the letter."" She took the letter out of my pocket."
8642,4,"""Keep your hands in your pockets."" She climbed the fence with the letter in her hand and went through the brown, rattling flowers."
8643,4,Mrs Patterson came to the door and opened it and stood there.5.1Mr Patterson was chopping in the green flowers.
8644,4,He stopped chopping and looked at me.
8645,4,"Mrs Patterson came across the garden, running."
8646,4,When I saw her eyes I began to cry.
8647,4,"You idiot, Mrs Patterson said, I told him never to send you alone again."
8648,4,Give it to me.
8649,4,Quick.
8650,4,"Mr Patterson came fast, with the hoc."
8651,4,"Mrs Patterson leaned across the fence, reaching her hand."
8652,4,She was trying to climb the fence.
8653,4,"Give it to me, she said, Give it to me."
8654,4,Mr Patterson climbed the fence.
8655,4,He took the letter.
8656,4,Mrs Patterson's dress was caught on the fence.
8657,4,"I saw her eyes again and I ran down the hill.19.5""They aint nothing over yonder but houses."" Luster said."
8658,4,"""We going down to the branch.""They were washing down at the branch."

8777,4,"We went up the hill, but Quentin didn't come."
8778,4,He was down at the branch when we got to where we could smell the pigs.
8779,4,They were grunting and snuffing in the trough in the comer.
8780,4,"Jason came behind us, with his hands in his pockets."

8796,4,The ground kept sloping up and the cows ran up the hill.
8797,4,T.P.
8798,4,tried to get up.
8799,4,He fell down again and the cows ran down the hill.
8800,4,Quentin held my arm and we went toward the barn.
8801,4,Then the barn wasn't there and we had to wait until it came back.
8802,4,I didn't see it come back.
8803,4,It came behind us and Quentin set me down in the trough where the cows ate.
8804,4,I held on to it.
8805,4,"It was going away too, and I held to it."

8822,4,"Every time Quentin thumped him against the wall he tried to say Whooey, but he couldn't say it for laughing."
8823,4,"I quit crying, but I couldn't stop."
8824,4,T.P.
8825,4,fell on me and the barn door went away.
8826,4,It went down the hill and T.P.
8827,4,was fighting by himself and he fell down again.
8828,4,"He was still laughing, and I couldn't stop, and I tried to get up and I fell down, and I couldn't stop."

8856,4,"It was hot inside me, and I began again."
8857,4,"I was crying now, and something was happening inside me and I cried more, and they held me until it stopped happening."
8858,4,Then I hushed.
8859,4,"It was still going around, and then the shapes began."
8860,4,"Open the crib, Versh."
8861,4,They were going slow.
8862,4,Spread those empty sacks on the floor.
8863,4,"They were going faster, almost fast enough."
8864,4,Now.

8869,4,"I went on with them, up the bright hill.1.4At the top of the hill Versh put me down."
8870,4,"""Come on here, Quentin."" he called, looking back down the hill."
8871,4,Quentin was still standing there by the branch.
8872,4,"He was chunking into the shadows where the branch was.""Let the old skizzard stay there."" Caddy said."
8873,4,She took my hand and we went on past the barn and through the gate.
8874,4,"There was a frog on the brick walk, squatting in the middle of it."
8875,4,"Caddy stepped over it and pulled me on.""Come on, Maury."" she said."
8876,4,"It still squatted there until Jason poked at it with his toe.""He'll make a wart on you."" Versh said."
8877,4,"The frog hopped away.""Come on, Maury."" Caddy said.""They got company tonight."" Versh said.""How do you know."" Caddy said.""With all them lights on."" Versh said."

8897,4,"""Have we got company.""Yes."" Father said.""I told you they was company."" Versh said.""You did not."" Caddy said."

8899,4,"I said I would """"Hush."" Father said."
8900,4,They hushed and Father opened the door and we crossed the back porch and went in to the kitchen.
8901,4,"Dilsey was there, and Father put me in the chair and closed the apron down and pushed it to the table, where supper was."
8902,4,"It was steaming up.""You mind Dilsey, now."" Father said."
8903,4,"""Dont let them make any more noise than they can help, Dilsey.""""Yes, sir."" Dilsey said."
8904,4,"Father went away.""Remember to mind Dilsey, now."" he said behind us."

8917,4,"""Dont you know anything.""""Shhhhhh."" Dilsey said."

8920,4,"Here, Versh."
8921,4,"Git his spoon."" Versh's hand came with the spoon, into the bowl."
8922,4,The spoon came up to my mouth.
8923,4,The steam tickled into my mouth.
8924,4,"Then we quit eating and we looked at each other and we were quiet, and then we heard it again and I began to cry.""What was that."" Caddy said."
8925,4,"She put her hand on my hand.""That was Mother."" Quentin said."
8926,4,"The spoon came up and I ate, then I cried again.""Hush."" Caddy said."
8927,4,But I didn't hush and she came and put her arms around me.
8928,4,"Dilsey went and closed both the doors and then we couldn't hear it.""Hush, now."" Caddy said."
8929,4,I hushed and ate.
8930,4,"Quentin wasn't eating, but Jason was.""That was Mother."" Quentin said."
8931,4,"He got up.""You set right down."" Dilsey said."

8938,4,"Hasn't he got to mind me.""""Eat your supper, Quentin."" Dilsey said."
8939,4,"""You all got to get done and get out of my kitchen.""""I dont want any more supper."
8940,4,"Quentin said.""You've got to eat if I say you have."" Caddy said."
8941,4,"""Hasn't he, Dilsey."" The bowl steamed up to my face, and Versh's hand dipped the spoon in it and the steam tickled into my mouth.""I dont want any more."" Quentin said."
8942,4,"""How can they have a party when Damuddy's sick.""""They'll have it down stairs."" Caddy said."
8943,4,"""She can come to the landing and see it."

8948,4,"""Cry baby.""""I'm going to tell on you."" Jason said.He was crying."
8949,4,"""You've already told."" Caddy said."
8950,4,"""There's not anything else you can tell, now.""""You all needs to go to bed."" Dilsey said."
8951,4,She came and lifted me down and wiped my face and hands with a warm cloth.
8952,4,"""Versh, can you get them up the back stairs quiet."
8953,4,"You, Jason, shut up that crying.""""It's too early to go to bed now."" Caddy said."

8963,4,Versh took me up and opened the door onto the back porch.
8964,4,We went out and Versh closed the door black.
8965,4,I could smell Versh and feel him.
8966,4,"You all be quiet, now."
8967,4,We're not going up stairs yet.
8968,4,Mr Jason said for you to come right up stairs.
8969,4,He said to mind me.
8970,4,I'm not going to mind you.
8971,4,But he said for all of us to.
8972,4,"Didn't he, Quentin."
8973,4,I could feel Versh's head.
8974,4,I could hear us.
8975,4,"Didn't he, Versh."
8976,4,"Yes, that right."
8977,4,Then I say for us to go out doors a while.
8978,4,Come on.
8979,4,"Versh opened the door and we went out.We went down the steps.""I expect we'd better go down to Versh's house, so we'll be quiet."" Caddy said."
8980,4,"Versh put me down and Caddy took my hand and we went down the brick walk.""Come on."" Caddy said."

8982,4,"He's hopped way over to the garden, by now."
8983,4,"Maybe we'll see another one."" Roskus came with the milk buckets."
8984,4,He went on.
8985,4,Quentin wasn't coming with us.
8986,4,He was sitting on the kitchen steps.

8988,4,I liked to smell Versh's house.
8989,4,[...]13.1[...]There was a fire in it and T.P.
8990,4,"squatting in his shirt tail in front of it, chunking it into a blaze.15.1Then I got up and T.P."

9649,4,"He wont hurt anybody, anyway."
9650,4,"Come on.""""I'm scared to."
9651,4,I'm scared.
9652,4,"I'm going to cross the street.""""He cant get out.""I wasn't crying.""Dont be a fraid cat."
9653,4,"Come on.""They came on in the twilight."
9654,4,"I wasn't crying, and I held to the gate.They came slow.""I'm scared.""""He wont hurt you."
9655,4,I pass here every day.
9656,4,"He just runs along the fence.""They came on."
9657,4,"I opened the gate and they stopped, turning."
9658,4,"I was trying to say, and I caught her, trying to say, and she screamed and I was trying to say and trying arid the bright shapes began to stop and I tried to get out."
9659,4,"I tried to get it off of my face, but the bright shapes were going again."
9660,4,They were going up the hill to where it fell away and I tried to cry.
9661,4,"But when I breathed in, I couldn't breathe out again to cry, and I tried to keep from falling off the hill and I fell off the hill into the bright, whirling shapes.19.14Here, looney, Luster said."
9662,4,Here come some.
9663,4,"Hush your slobbering and moaning, now.They came to the flag."
9664,4,"He took it out and they hit, then he put the flag back.""Mister."" Luster said.He looked around."
9665,4,"""What."" he said.""Want to buy a golf ball."" Luster said.""Let's see it."" he said."
9666,4,"He came to the fence and Luster reached the ball through.""Where'd you get it."" he said.""Found it."" Luster said.""I know that."" he said."
9667,4,"""Where."
9668,4,"In somebody's golf bag.""""I found it laying over here in the yard."" Luster said."
9669,4,"""I'll take a quarter for it.""""What makes you think it's yours."" he said.""I."
9670,4,"Jewel and I come up from the field, following the path in single file."
9671,4,"Although I am fifteen feet ahead of him, anyone watching us from the cottonhouse can see Jewel's frayed and broken straw hat a full head above my own.The path runs straight as a plumb-line, worn smooth by feet and baked brick-hard by July, between the green rows of laid-by cotton, to the cottonhouse in the center of the field, where it turns and circles the cottonhouse at four soft right angles and goes on across the field again, worn so by feet in fading precision.The cottonhouse is of rough logs, from between which the chinking has long fallen."
9672,4,"Square, with a broken roof set at a single pitch, it leans in empty and shimmering dilapidation in the sunlight, a single broad window in two opposite walls giving onto the approaches of the path."
9673,4,When we reach it I turn and follow the path which circles the house.
9674,4,"Jewel, fifteen feet behind me, looking straight ahead, steps in a single stride through the window."
9675,4,"Still staring straight ahead, his pale eyes like wood set into his wooden face, he crosses the floor in four strides with the rigid gravity of a cigar store Indian dressed in patched overalls and endued with life from the hips down, and steps in a single stride through the opposite window and into the path again just as I come around the corner."
9676,4,"In single file and five feet apart and Jewel now in front, we go on up the path toward the foot of the bluff.Tull's wagon stands beside the spring, hitched to the rail, the reins wrapped about the seat stanchion."
9677,4,In the wagon bed are two chairs.
9678,4,Jewel stops at the spring and takes the gourd from the willow branch and drinks.
9679,4,"I pass him and mount the path, beginning to hear Cash's saw.When I reach the top he has quit sawing."
9680,4,"Standing in a litter of chips, he is fitting two of the boards together."
9681,4,"Between the shadow spaces they are yellow as gold, like soft gold, bearing on their flanks in smooth undulations the marks of the adze blade: a good carpenter, Cash is."
9682,4,"He holds the two planks on the trestle, fitted along the edges in a quarter of the finished box."
9683,4,"He kneels and squints along the edge of them, then he lowers them and takes up the adze."
9684,4,A good carpenter.
9685,4,"Addie Bundren could not want a better one, better box to lie in."
9686,4,It will give her confidence and comfort.
9687,4,"I go on to the house, followed by theChuck."
9688,4,Chuck.
9689,4,Chuck.of the adze.CoraSo I saved out the eggs and baked yesterday.
9690,4,The cakes turned out right well.
9691,4,We depend a lot on our chickens.
9692,4,"They are good layers, what few we have left after the possums and such."
9693,4,"Snakes too, in the summer."
9694,4,A snake will break up a hen-house quicker than anything.
9695,4,"So after they were going to cost so much more than Mr Tull thought, and after I promised that the difference in the number of eggs would make it up, I had to be more careful than ever because it was on my final say-so we took them."
9696,4,"We could have stocked cheaper chickens, but I gave my promise as Miss Lawington said when she advised me to get a good breed, because Mr Tull himself admits that a good breed of cows or hogs pays in the long run."
9697,4,"So when we lost so many of them we couldn't afford to use the eggs ourselves, because I could not have had Mr Tull chide me when it was on my say-so we took them."
9698,4,"So when Miss Lawington told me about the cakes I thought that I could bake them and earn enough, at one time to increase the net value of the flock the equivalent of two head."
9699,4,"And that by saving the eggs out one at a time, even the eggs wouldn't be costing anything."
9700,4,"And that week they laid so well that I not only saved out enough eggs above what we had engaged to sell, to bake the cakes with, I had saved enough so that the flour and the sugar and the stove wood would not be costing anything."
9701,4,"So I baked yesterday, more careful than ever I baked in my life, and the cakes turned out right well."
9702,4,"But when we got to town this morning Miss Lawington told me the lady had changed her mind and was not going to have the party after all.""She ought to taken those cakes anyway,"" Kate says.""Well,"" I say, ""I reckon she never had no use for them now.""""She ought to taken them,"" Kate says."
9703,4,"""But those rich town ladies can change their minds."
9704,4,"Poor folks cant.""Riches is nothing in the face of the Lord, for He can see into the heart."
9705,4,"""Maybe I can sell them at the bazaar Saturday,"" I say."
9706,4,"They turned out real well.""You cant get two dollars a piece for them,"" Kate says.""Well, it isn't like they cost me anything,"" I say."
9707,4,I saved them out and swapped a dozen of them for the sugar and flour.
9708,4,"It isn't like the cakes cost me anything, as Mr Tull himself realises that the eggs I saved were over and beyond what we had engaged to sell, so it was like we had found the eggs or they had been given to us.""She ought to taken those cakes when she same as gave you her word,"" Kate says."
9709,4,The Lord can see into the heart.
9710,4,"If it is His will that some folks has different ideas of honesty from other folks, it is not my place to question His decree.""I reckon she never had any use for them,"" I say."
9711,4,"They turned out real well, too.The quilt is drawn up to her chin, hot as it is, with only her two hands and her face outside."
9712,4,"She is propped on the pillow, with her head raised so she can see out the window, and we can hear him every time he takes up the adze or the saw."
9713,4,"If we were deaf we could almost watch her face and hear him, see him."
9714,4,Her face is wasted away so that the bones draw just under the skin in white lines.
9715,4,Her eyes are like two candles when you watch them gutter down into the sockets of iron candle-sticks.
9716,4,"But the eternal and the everlasting salvation and grace is not upon her.""They turned out real nice,"" I say."
9717,4,"""But not like the cakes Addie used to bake."" You can see that girl's washing and ironing in the pillow-slip, if ironed it ever was."
9718,4,"Maybe it will reveal her blindness to her, laying there at the mercy and the ministration of four men and a tom-boy girl."
9719,4,"""There's not a woman in this section could ever bake with Addie Bundren,"" I say."
9720,4,"""First thing we know she'll be up and baking again, and then we wont have any sale for ours at all."" Under the quilt she makes no more of a hump than a rail would, and the only way you can tell she is breathing is by the sound of the mattress shucks."
9721,4,"Even the hair, at her cheek does not move, even with that girl standing right over her, fanning her with the fan."
9722,4,"While we watch she swaps the fan to the other hand without Stopping it.""Is she sleeping?"" Kate whispers.""She's just watching Cash yonder,"" the girl says."
9723,4,We can hear the saw in the board.
9724,4,It sounds like snoring.
9725,4,Eula turns on the trunk and looks out the window.
9726,4,Her necklace looks real nice with her red hat.
9727,4,"You wouldn't think it only cost twenty-five cents.""She ought to taken those cakes,"" Kate says.I could have used the money real well."
9728,4,But it's not like they cost me anything except the baking.
9729,4,"I can tell him that anybody is likely to make a miscue, but it's not all of them that can get out of it without loss, I can tell him."
9730,4,"It's not everybody can eat their mistakes, I can tell him.Someone comes through the hall."
9731,4,It is Darl.
9732,4,He does not look in as he passes the door.
9733,4,Eula watches him as he goes on and passes from sight again toward the back.
9734,4,"Her hand rises and touches her beads lightly, and then her hair."
9735,4,"When she finds me watching her, her eyes go blank.DarlPa and Vernon are sitting on the back porch."
9736,4,"Pa is tilting snuff from the lid of his snuff-box into his lower lip, holding the lip outdrawn between thumb and finger."
9737,4,"They look around as I cross the porch and dip the gourd into the water bucket and drink.""Where's Jewel?"" pa says."
9738,4,When I was a boy I first learned how much better water tastes when it has set a while in a cedar bucket.
9739,4,"Warmish-cool, with a faint taste like the hot July wind in cedar trees smells."
9740,4,"It has to set at least six hours, and be drunk from a gourd."
9741,4,Water should never be drunk from metal.And at night it is better still.
9742,4,"I used to lie on the pallet in the hall, waiting until I could hear them all asleep, so I could get up and go back to the bucket."
9743,4,"It would be black, the shelf black, the still surface of the water a round orifice in nothingness, where before I stirred it awake with the dipper I could see maybe a star or two in the bucket, and maybe in the dipper a star or two before I drank."
9744,4,"After that I was bigger, older."
9745,4,"Then I would wait until they all went to sleep so I could lie with my shirt-tail up, hearing them asleep, feeling myself without touching myself, feeling the cool silence blowing upon my parts and wondering if Cash was yonder in the darkness doing it too, had been doing it perhaps for the last two years before I could have wanted to or could have.Pa's feet are badly splayed, his toes cramped and bent and warped, with no toenail at all on his little toes, from working so hard in the wet in homemade shoes when he was a boy."
9746,4,Beside his chair his brogans sit.
9747,4,They look as though they had been hacked with a blunt axe out of pig-iron.
9748,4,Vernon has been to town.
9749,4,I have never seen him go to town in overalls.
9750,4,"His wife, they say."
9751,4,"She taught school too, once.I fling the dipper dregs to the ground and wipe my mouth on my sleeve."
9752,4,It is going to rain before morning.
9753,4,Maybe before dark.
9754,4,"""Down to the barn,"" I say."
9755,4,"""Harnessing the team.""Down there fooling with that horse."
9756,4,"He will go on through the barn, into the pasture."
9757,4,"The horse will not be in sight: he is up there among the pine seedlings, in the cool."
9758,4,"Jewel whistles, once and shrill."
9759,4,"The horse snorts, then Jewel sees him, glinting for a gaudy instant among the blue shadows."
9760,4,"Jewel whistles again; the horse comes dropping down the slope, stiff-legged, his ears cocking and flicking, his mis-matched eyes rolling, and fetches up twenty feet away, broadside on, watching Jewel over his shoulder in an attitude kittenish and alert.""Come here, sir,"" Jewel says."
9761,4,He moves.
9762,4,"Moving that quick his coat, bunching, tongues swirling like so many flames."
9763,4,"With tossing mane and tail and rolling eye the horse makes another short curvetting rush and stops again, feet bunched, watching Jewel."
9764,4,"Jewel walks steadily toward him, his hands at his sides."
9765,4,"Save for Jewel's legs they are like two figures carved for a tableau savage in the sun.When Jewel can almost touch him, the horse stands on his hind legs and slashes down at Jewel."
9766,4,"Then Jewel is enclosed by a glittering maze of hooves as by an illusion of wings; among them, beneath the up-reared chest, he moves with the flashing limberness of a snake."
9767,4,"For an instant before the jerk comes onto his arms he sees his whole body earth-free, horizontal, whipping snake-umber, until he finds the horse's nostrils and touches earth again."
9768,4,"Then they are rigid, motionless, terrific, the horse back-thrust on stiffened, quivering legs, with lowered head; Jewel with dug heels, shutting off the horse's wind with one hand, with the other patting the horse's neck in short strokes myriad and caressing, cursing the horse with obsceneferocity.They stand in rigid terrific hiatus, the horse trembling and groaning."
9769,4,Then Jewel is on the horse's back.
9770,4,"He flows upward in a stooping swirl like the lash of a whip, his body in midair shaped to the horse."
9771,4,"For another moment the horse stands spraddled, with lowered head, before it bursts into motion."
9772,4,"They descend the hill in a series of spine-jolting jumps, Jewel high, leech-like on the withers, to the fence where the horse bunches to a scuttering halt again.""Well,"" Jewel says, ""you can quit now, if you got a-plenty.""Inside the barn Jewel slides running to the ground before the horse stops."
9773,4,"The horse enters the stall, Jewel following."
9774,4,"Without looking back the horse kicks at him, slamming a single hoof into the wall with a pistol-like report."
9775,4,"Jewel kicks him in the stomach; the horse arches his neck back, crop-toothed; Jewel strikes him across the face with his fist and slides on to the trough and mounts upon it."
9776,4,Clinging to the hay-rack he lowers his head and peers out across the stall tops and through the doorway.
9777,4,The path is empty; from here he cannot even hear Cash sawing.
9778,4,"He reaches up and drags down hay in hurried armsful and crams it into the rack.""Eat,"" he says."
9779,4,"""Get the goddamn stuff out of sight while'you got a chance, you pussel-gutted bastard."
9780,4,"You sweet son of a bitch,"" he says.DarlWe watch him come around the corner and mount do steps."
9781,4,He does not look at us.
9782,4,"""You ready?"" he says.""If you're hitched up,"" I say."
9783,4,"I say ""Wait."" He stops, looking at pa."
9784,4,"Vernon spits, without moving."
9785,4,He spits With decorous and deliberate precision into the pocked dust below the porch.
9786,4,Pa rubs his hands slowly on his knees.
9787,4,"He is gazing out beyond the crest of the bluff, out across the land."
9788,4,"Jewel watches him a moment, then he goes on to the pail and drinks again."
9789,4,"""I mislike undecision as much as ere a man,"" pasays.""It means three dollars,"" I say."
9790,4,The shirt across pa's hump is faded lighter than the rest of it.
9791,4,There is no sweat stain on his shirt.
9792,4,I have never seen a sweat stain on his shirt.
9793,4,"He was sick once from working in the sun when he was twenty-two years old, and he tells people that if he ever sweats, he will die."
9794,4,"I suppose he believes it.""But if she dont last until you get back,"" he says."
9795,4,"""She will be disappointed.""Vernon spits into the dust."
9796,4,"But it will rain before morning.""She's counted on it,"" pa says."
9797,4,"""She'll- want to start right away."
9798,4,I know her.
9799,4,"I promised her I'd keep the team here and ready, and she's counting on it.""""We'll need that three dollars then, sure,"" I say."
9800,4,"He gazes out over the land, rubbing his hands on his knees."
9801,4,Since he lost his teeth his mouth collapses in slow repetition when he dips.
9802,4,The stubble gives his lower face that appearance that old dogs have.
9803,4,"""You'd better make up your mind soon, so we can get there and get a load on before dark,"" I say.""Ma aint that sick,"" Jewel says."
9804,4,"""Shut up, Darl.""That's right,"" Vernon says."
9805,4,"""She seems more Wee herself today than she has in a week."
9806,4,"Time you and Jewel get back, she'll be setting up.""""You ought to know,"" Jewel says."
9807,4,"""You been here often enough looking at her."
9808,4,"You or your folks."" Vernon looks at him."
9809,4,Jewel's eyes look like pale wood in his high-blooded face.
9810,4,"He is a head taller than any of the rest of us, always was."
9811,4,I told them that's why ma always whipped him and petted him more.
9812,4,Because he was peakling around the house more.
9813,4,"That's why she named him Jewel I told them.""Shut up, Jewel,"" pa says, but as though he is not listening much."
9814,4,"He gazes out across the land, rubbing his knees.""You could borrow the loan of Vernon's team and we could catch up with you,"" I say."
9815,4,"""If she didn't wait for us.""""Ah, shut your goddamn mouth,"" Jewel says."
9816,4,"""She'll want to go in ourn,"" pa says."
9817,4,He rubs his knees.
9818,4,"""Dont ere a man mislike it more.""""It's laying there, watching Cash whittle on that damn ."
9819,4,.
9820,4,"."" Jewel says."
9821,4,"He says it harshly, savagely, but he does not say the word."
9822,4,"Like a little boy in the dark to flail his courage and suddenly aghast into silence by his own noise.""She wanted that like she wants to go in our own wagon,"" pa says."
9823,4,"""She'll rest easier for knowing it's a good one, and private."
9824,4,She was ever a private woman.
9825,4,"You know it well.""Then let it be private,"" Jewel says."
9826,4,"""But how the hell can you expect it to be"" he looks at the back o£ pa's head, his eyes like pale wooden eyes.""Sho,"" Vernon says, ""she'll hold on till it's finished."
9827,4,"She'll hold on till everything's ready, till her own good time."
9828,4,"And with the roads like they are now, it wont take you no time to get her to town.""""It's fixing up to rain,"" pa says."
9829,4,"""I am a luckless man."
9830,4,"I have ever been."" He rubs his hands on his knees."
9831,4,"""It's that durn doctor, liable to come at any time."
9832,4,I couldn't get word to him till so late.
9833,4,"If he was to come tomorrow and tell her the time was nigh, she wouldn't wait, 1 know her."
9834,4,"Wagon or no wagon, she wouldn't wait."
9835,4,"Then she'd be upset, and I wouldn't upset her for the living world."
9836,4,"With that family burying-ground in Jefferson and them of her blood waiting for her there, she'll be impatient."
9837,4,"I promised my word me and the boys would get her there quick as mules could walk it, so she could rest quiet."" He rubs his hands on his knees."
9838,4,"""No man ever misliked it more.""""If everybody wasn't burning hell to get her there,"" Jewel says in that harsh, savage voice."
9839,4,"""With Cash all day long right under the window, hammering and sawing at that""""It was her wish,"" pa says."
9840,4,"""You."
9841,4,got no affection nor gentleness for her.
9842,4,You never had.
9843,4,"We would be beholden to no man,"" he says, ""me and her."
9844,4,"We have never yet been, and she will rest quieter for knowing it and that it was her own blood sawed out the boards and drove the nails."
9845,4,"She was ever one to clean up after herself.""It means three dollars,"" I say."
9846,4,"""Do you want us to go, or not?"" Pa rubs his knees."
9847,4,"""Well be back by tomorrow sundown.""""Well ..."" pa says."
9848,4,"He looks out over the land, awry-haired, mouthing the snuff slowly against, his gums.""Come on,"" Jewel says."
9849,4,He goes down the steps.
9850,4,"Vernon spits neatly into the dust.""By sundown, now,"" pa says."
9851,4,"""I would not keep her waiting.""Jewel glances back, then he goes on around the house."
9852,4,"I enter the hall, hearing the voices before I reach the door."
9853,4,"Tilting a little down the hill, as our house does, a breeze draws through the hall all the time, upslanting."
9854,4,"A feather dropped near the front door will rise and brush along the ceiling, slanting backward, until it reaches the down-turning current at the back door: so with voices."
9855,4,"As you enter the hall, they sound as though they were speaking out of the air about your head.CoraIt was the sweetest thing I ever saw."
9856,4,"It was like he knew he would never see her again, that Anse Bundren was driving him from his mother's death bed, never to see her in this world again."
9857,4,I always said Darl was different from those others.
9858,4,"I always said he was the only one of them that had his mother's nature, had any natural affection."
9859,4,"Not that Jewel, the one she labored so to bear and coddled and petted so and him flinging into tantrums or sulking spells, inventing devilment to devil her until I would have trailed him time and time."
9860,4,Not him to come and tell her goodbye.
9861,4,Not him to miss a chance to make that extra three dollars at the price of his mother's goodbye kiss.
9862,4,"A Bundren through and through, loving nobody, caring for nothing except how to get something with the least amount of work."
9863,4,Mr Tull says Darl asked them to wait.
9864,4,He said Darl almost begged them on his knees not to force him to leave her in her condition.
9865,4,But nothing would do but Anse and Jewel must make that three dollars.
9866,4,"Nobody that knows Anse could have expected different, but to think of that boy, that Jewel, selling all those years of self-denial and down-right partiality they couldn't fool me: Mr Tull says Mrs Bundren liked Jewel the least of all, but I knew better."
9867,4,"I knew she was partial to him, to the same quality in him that let her put up with Anse Bundren when Mr Tull said she ought to poisoned him for three dollars, denying his dying mother the goodbye Mss.Why, for the last three weeks I have been coming over every time I could, coming sometimes when I shouldn't have, neglecting my own family and duties so that somebody would be with her in her last moments and she would not have to face the Great Unknown without one familiar face to give her courage."
9868,4,Not that I deserve credit for it: I will expect the same for myself.
9869,4,"But thank God it will be the faces of my loved kin, my blood and flesh, for in my husband and children I have been more blessed than most, trials though they have been at times.She lived, a lonely woman, lonely with her pride, trying to make folks believe different, hiding the fact that they just suffered her, because she was not cold in the coffin before they were carting her forty miles away to bury her, flouting the will of God to do it."
9870,4,"Refusing to let her lie in the same earth with those Bundrens.""But she wanted to go,"" Mr Tull said."
9871,4,"'It was her own wish to lie among her own people.""""Then why didn't she go alive?"" I said."
9872,4,"""Not one of them would have stopped her, with even that little one almost old enough now to be selfish and stone-hearted like the rest of them.""""It was her own wish,"" Mr Tull said."
9873,4,"""I heard Arisesay it was.""""And you would believe Anse, of course,"" I said."
9874,4,"""A man like you would, Dont tell me.""""I'd believe him about something he couldn't expect to make anything off of me by not telling,"" Mr Tull said.""Dont tell me,"" I said."
9875,4,"""A woman's place is with her husband and children, alive or dead."
9876,4,"Would you expect me to want to go back to Alabama and leave you and the girls when my time comes, that I left of my own will to cast my lot with yours for better and worse, until death and after?""""Well, folks are different,"" he said."
9877,4,I should hope so.
9878,4,"I have tried to live right in the sight of God and man, for the honor and comfort of my Christian husband and the love and respect of my Christian children."
9879,4,"So that when I lay me down in the consciousness of my duty and reward I will be surrounded by loving faces, carrying the farewell kiss of each of my loved ones into my reward."
9880,4,"Not like Addie Bundren dying alone, hiding her pride and her broken heart."
9881,4,Glad to go.
9882,4,"Lying there with her head propped up so she could watch Cash building the coffin, having to watch him so he would not skimp on it, like as not, with those men not worrying about anything except if there was time to earn another three dollars""before the rain come and the river got too high to get across it."
9883,4,"Like as not, if they hadn't decided to make that last load, they would have loaded her into the wagon on a quilt and crossed the river first and then stopped and give her time to die what Christian death they would let her.Except Darl."
9884,4,It was the sweetest thing I ever saw.
9885,4,Sometimes I lose faith in human nature for a time; I am assailed by doubt.
9886,4,But always the Lord restores my faith and reveals to me His bounteous love for His creatures.
9887,4,"Not Jewel, the one she had always cherished, not him."
9888,4,He was after that three extra dollars.
9889,4,"It was Darl, the one that folks say is queer, lazy, pottering about the place no better than Anse, with Cash a good carpenter and always more building than he can get around to, and Jewel always doing something that made him some money or got him talked about, and that near-naked girl always standing over Addie with a fan so that every time a body tried to talk to her and cheer her up, would answer for her right quick, like she was trying to keep anybody from coming near her at all.It was Darl."
9890,4,"He come to the door and stood there, looking at his dying mother."
9891,4,"He just looked at her, and I felt the bounteous love of the Lord again and His mercy."
9892,4,"I saw that with Jewel she had just been pretending, but that it was between her and Darl that the understanding and the true love was."
9893,4,"He just looked at her, not even coming in where she could see him and get upset, knowing that Anse was driving him away and he would never see her again."
9894,4,"He said nothing, just looking at her.""What you want, Darl?"" Dewey Dell said, not stopping the fan, speaking up quick, keeping even him from her."
9895,4,He didn't answer.
9896,4,"He just stood and looked at his dying mother, his heart too full for words.Dewey DellThe first time me and Lafe picked on down the row."
9897,4,Pa dassent sweat because he will catch his death from the sickness so everybody that comes to help us.
9898,4,"And Jewel dont care about anything he is not kin to us in caring, not care-kin."
9899,4,And Cash like sawing the long hot sad yellow days up into planks and nailing them to something.
9900,4,And pa thinks because neighbors will always treat one another that way because he has always been too busy letting neighbors do for him to find out.
9901,4,"And I did not think that Darl would, that sits at the supper table with his eyes gone further than the food and the lamp, full of the land dug out of hisskull and the holes filled with distance beyond the land.We picked on down the row, the woods getting closer and closer and the secret shade, picking on into the secret shade with my sack and Lafe's sack."
9902,4,Because I said will I or wont I when the sack was half full because I said if the sack is full when we get to the woods it wont be me.
9903,4,"I said if it dont mean for me to do it the sack will not be full and I will turn up the next row but if the sack is full, I cannot help it."
9904,4,It will be that I had to do it all the time and I cannot help it.
9905,4,And we picked on toward the secret shade and our eyes would drown together touching on his hands and my hands and I didn't say anything.
9906,4,"I said ""What are you doing?"" and he said ""I am picking into your sack."" And so it was full when we came to the end of the row and I could not help it."
9907,4,)And so it was because I could not help it.
9908,4,"It was then, and then I saw Darl and he knew."
9909,4,"He said he knew without the words like he told me that ma is going to die without words, and I knew he knew because if he had said he knew with the words I would not have believed that he had been there and saw us."
9910,4,"But he said he did know and I said ""Are you going to tell pa are you going to kill him?"" without the words I said it and he said ""Why?"" without the words."
9911,4,"And that's why I can talk to him with knowing with hating because he knows.He stands in the door, looking at her.""What you want, Darl?"" I say.""She is going to die,"" he says."
9912,4,"And old turkey-buzzard Tull coming to watch her die but I can fool them.""When is she going to die?"" I say.""Before we get back,"" he says.""Then why are you taking Jewel?"" I say.""I want him to help me load,"" he says.TullAnse keeps on rubbing his knees."
9913,4,"His overalls are faded; on one knee a serge patch cut out of a pair of Sunday pants, wore iron-slick."
9914,4,"""No man mislikes it more than me,"" he says.""A fellow's got to guess ahead now and then,"" I say."
9915,4,"""But, come long and short, it wont be no harm done neither way.""""She'll want to get started right off,"" he says."
9916,4,"""It's far enough to Jefferson at best.""""But the roads is good now,"" I say."
9917,4,"It's fixing to rain tonight, too."
9918,4,"His folks buries at New Hope, too, not three miles away."
9919,4,"But it's just like him to marry a woman born a day's hard ride away and have her die on him.He looks out over the land, rubbing his knees."
9920,4,"""No man so mislikes it,"" he says.""They'll get back in plenty of time,"" I say."
9921,4,"""I wouldn't worry none.""""It means three dollars,"" he says.""Might be it wont be no need for them to rush back, noways,"" I say."
9922,4,"""I hope it.""""She's a-going,"" he says."
9923,4,"""Her mind is set on it.""It's a hard Me on women, for a fact."
9924,4,Some women.
9925,4,I mind my mammy lived to be seventy and more.
9926,4,"Worked every day, rain or shine; never a sick day since her last chap was born until one day she kind of looked around her and then she went and taken that lace-trimmed night gown she had had forty-five years and never wore out of the chest and put it on and laid down on the bed and pulled the covers up and shut her eyes."
9927,4,"""You all will have to look out for pa the best you can,"" she said."
9928,4,"""I'm tired.""Anse rubs his hands on his knees."
9929,4,"""The Lord giveth,"" he says."
9930,4,We can hear Cash a-hammering and sawing beyond the corner.It's true.
9931,4,Never a truer breath was ever breathed.
9932,4,"""The Lord giveth,"" I say.That boy comes up the hill."
9933,4,He is carrying a fish nigh long as he is.
9934,4,"He slings it to the ground and grunts ""Hah"" and spits over his shoulder like a man."
9935,4,"Durn nigh long as he is.""What's that?"" I say."
9936,4,"""A hog? Where'd you get it?""""Down to the bridge,"" he says."
9937,4,"He turns it over, the under side caked over with dust where it is wet, the eye coated over, humped under the dirt.""Are you aiming to leave it laying there?"" Anse says.""I aim to show it to ma,"" Vardaman says."
9938,4,He looks toward the door.
9939,4,"We can hear the talking, coming out on the draft."
9940,4,"Cash, too, knocking and hammering at the boards."
9941,4,"""There's company in there,"" he says."
9942,4,"""Just my folks,"" I say."
9943,4,"""They'd enjoy to see it too."" He says nothing, watching the door."
9944,4,Then he looks down at the fish laying in the dust.
9945,4,"He turns it over with his foot and prods at the eye-bump with his toe, gouging at it."
9946,4,Anse is looking out over the land.
9947,4,"Vardaman looks at Anse's face, then at the door."
9948,4,"He turns, going toward the corner of the house, when Anse calls him without looking around."
9949,4,"""You clean that fish,"" Anse says."
9950,4,Vardaman stops.
9951,4,"""Why cant Dewey Dell clean it?"" he says.""You clean that fish,"" Anse says."
9952,4,"""Aw, pa,"" Vardaman says.""You clean it,"" Anse says."
9953,4,He dont look around.
9954,4,Vardaman comes back and picks up the fish.
9955,4,"It slides out of his hands, smearing wet dirt onto him, and flops down, dirtying itself again, gapmouthed, goggle-eyed, hiding into the dust like it was ashamed of being dead, like it was in a hurry to get back hid again.' Vardaman cusses it."
9956,4,"He cusses it like a grown man, standing a-straddle of it."
9957,4,Anse dont look around.
9958,4,Vardaman picks it up again.
9959,4,"He goes on around the house, toting it in both arms like a armful of wood, it overlapping him on both ends, head and tail."
9960,4,Durn nigh big as he is.Anse's wrists dangle out of his sleeves: I never see him with a shirt on that looked like it was his in all my life.
9961,4,They all looked like Jewel might have give him his old ones.
9962,4,"Not Jewel, though."
9963,4,"He's long-armed, even if he is spindling."
9964,4,Except for the lack of sweat.
9965,4,You could tell they aint been nobody else's but Anse's that way without no mistake.
9966,4,"His eyes look like pieces of bumt-out cinder fixed in his face, looking out over the land.When the shadow touches the steps he says ""Ifs five oclock.""Just as I get up Cora comes to the door and says it's time to get on."
9967,4,Anse reaches for his shoes.
9968,4,"""Now, Mr Bundren,"" Cora says, ""dont you get up now."" He puts his shoes on, stomping into them, like he does everything, like he is hoping all the time he really cant do it and can quit trying to."
9969,4,When we go up the hall we can hear them clumping on the floor like they was iron shoes.
9970,4,"He comes toward the door where she is, blinking his eyes, kind of looking ahead of hisself before he sees, like he is hoping to find her setting up, in a chair maybe or maybe sweeping, and looks into the door in that surprised way like he looks in and finds her still in bed every time and Dewey Dell still a-fanning her with the fan."
9971,4,"He stands there, like he dont aim to move again nor nothing else.""Well, I reckon we better get on,"" Cora says."
9972,4,"""I got to feed the chickens."" It's fixing to rain, too."
9973,4,"Clouds like that dont lie, and the cotton making every day the Lord sends."
9974,4,That'll be something else for him.
9975,4,Cash is still trimming at the boards.
9976,4,"""If there's ere a thing we can do,"" Cora says.""Ansell let us know,"" I say.Anse dont look at us."
9977,4,"He looks around, blinking, in that surprised way, like he had wore hisself down being surprised and was even surprised at that."
9978,4,"If Cash just works that careful on my banu""I told Anse it likely wont be no need,"" I say."
9979,4,"""I so hope it.""""Her mind is set on it,"" he says."
9980,4,"""1 reckon she's bound to go """"It comes to all of us,"" Cora says."
9981,4,"""Let the Lord comfort you.""""About that corn,"" I say."
9982,4,"I tell him again I will help .him out if he gets into a tight, with her sick and all."
9983,4,"Like most folks around here, I done holp him so much already I cant quit now.""I aimed to get to it today,"" he says."
9984,4,"""Seems like I cant get my mind on nothing.""""Maybe she'll hold out till you are laid-by,"" I say.""If God wills it,"" he says.""Let Him comfort you,"" Cora says.If Cash just works that careful on my barn."
9985,4,He looks up when we pass.
9986,4,"""Dont reckon I'll get to you this week,"" he says."" Taint no rush,"" I say."
9987,4,"""Whenever you get around to it.""We get into the wagon."
9988,4,Cora sets the cake box on her lap.
9989,4,"It's fixing to rain, sho.""I dont know what he'll do,"" Cora says."
9990,4,"""I just dont know.""""Poor Anse,"" I say."
9991,4,"""She kept him at work for thirty-odd years."
9992,4,"I reckon she is tired.""""And I reckon she'll be behind him for thirty years more,"" Kate says."
9993,4,"""Or if it aint her, hell get another one before cotton-picking.""""I reckon Cash and Darl can get married now,"" Eula says.""That poor boy,"" Cora says."
9994,4,"""The poor little tyke.""""What about Jewel?"" Kate says.""He can, too,"" Eula says.""Hmph,"" Kate says."
9995,4,"""I reckon he will."
9996,4,I reckon so.
9997,4,I reckon there's more gals than one around here that dont want to see Jewel tied down.
9998,4,"Well, they needn't to worry.""""Why, Kate!"" Cora says."
9999,4,The wagon begins to rattle.
10000,4,"""The poor little tyke,"" Cora says.It's fixing to rain this night."
10001,4,"Yes, sir."
10002,4,"A rattling wagon is mighty dry weather, for a Birdsell."
10003,4,But that'll be cured.
10004,4,"It will for a fact.""She ought to taken them cakes after she said she would,"" Kate says.AnseDurn that road."
10005,4,"And it fixing to rain, too."
10006,4,"I can stand here and same as see it with second-sight, a-shutting down behind them like a wall, shutting down betwixt them and my given promise."
10007,4,"I do the best I can, much as I can get my mind on anything, but durn them boys.A-laying there, right tip to my door, where every bad luck that comes and goes is bound to find it."
10008,4,"I told Addie it want any luck living on a road when it come by here, and she said, for the world like a woman, ""Get up and move, then."" But I told her it want no luck in it, because the Lord put roads for travelling: why He laid them down flat on the earth."
10009,4,"When He aims for something to be always a-moving,He makes it longways, like a road or a horse or a wagon, but when He aims for something to stay put, He makes it up-and-down ways, like a tree or a man."
10010,4,"And so he never aimed for folks to live on a road, because which gets there first, I says, the road or the house? Did you ever know Him to set a road down by a house? I says."
10011,4,"No you never, I says, because it's always men cant rest till they gets the house set where everybody that passes in a wagon can spit in the doorway, keeping the folks restless and wanting to get up and go somewheres else when He aimed for them to stay put like a tree or a stand of corn."
10012,4,"Because if He'd a aimed for man to be always a-moving and going somewheres else, wouldn't He a put him longways on his belly, like a snake? It stands to reason He would.Putting it where every bad luck prowling can find it and come straight to my door, charging me taxes on top of it."
10013,4,"Making me pay for Cash having to get them carpenter notions when if it hadn't been no road come there, he wouldn't a got them; falling off of churches and lifting no hand in six months and me and Addie slaving and a-slaving, when there's plenty of sawing; on this place he could do if he's got to saw.And Darl too."
10014,4,"Talking me out of him, durn them It aint that I am afraid of work; I always is fed me and mine and kept a roof above us: it's that they would short-hand me just because he tends to his own business, just because he's got his eyes full of the land all the time."
10015,4,"I says to them, he was all right at first, with his eyes full of the land, because the land laid up-and-down ways then; it wasn't till that ere road come and switched the land around longways and his eyes still full of the land, that they begun to threaten me out of him, trying to short-hand me with the law.Making me pay for it."
10016,4,"She was well and hale as ere a woman ever were, except for that road."
10017,4,"Just laying down, resting herself in her own bed, asking naught of none."
10018,4,"""Are you sick, Addie?"" I said."
10019,4,"""I am not sick,"" she said.""You lay you down and rest you,"" I said."
10020,4,"""I knowed you are not sick."
10021,4,You're just tired.
10022,4,"You lay you down and rest.""""I am not sick,"" she said."
10023,4,"""I will get up."" ""Lay still and rest,"" I said."
10024,4,'You are just tired.
10025,4,"You can get up tomorrow."" And she was laying there, well and hale as ere a woman ever were, except for that road.""I never sent for you,"" I said."
10026,4,"""I take you to witness I never sent for you.""""I know you didn't,"" Peabody said."
10027,4,"""I bound that."
10028,4,"Where is she?""""She's a-laying down,"" I said."
10029,4,"""She's just a little tired, but she'll""""Get outen here, Anse,"" he said."
10030,4,"""Go set on the porch a while.""And now I got to pay for it, me without a tooth in my head, hoping to get ahead enough so I could get my mouth fixed where I could eat God's own victuals as a man should, and her hale and well as ere a woman in the land until that day."
10031,4,Got to pay for being put to the need of that three dollars.
10032,4,Got to pay for the way for them boys to have to go away to earn it.
10033,4,"And now I can see same as second sight the rain shutting down betwixt us, a-coming up that road like a durn man, like it want ere a other house to rain on in all the living land.I nave heard men cuss their luck, and right, for they were sinful men."
10034,4,"But I do not say it's a curse on me, because I have done no wrong to be cussed by."
10035,4,"I am not religious, I reckon."
10036,4,But peace is my heart: I know it is.
10037,4,"I have done things but neither better nor worse than them that pretend otherlike, and I know that Old Marster will care for me as for ere a sparrow that falls."
10038,4,"But it seems hard that a man in his need could be so flouted by a road.Vardaman comes around the house, bloody as a hog to his knees, and that ere fish chopped up with the axe like as not, or maybe throwed away for him to lie about the dogs et it."
10039,4,"Well, I reckon I aint no call to expect no more of him .than of his man-growed brothers."
10040,4,"He comes along, watching the house, quiet, andsits on the steps."
10041,4,"""Whew,"" he says, ""I'm pure tired."" ""Go wash them hands,"" I say."
10042,4,"But couldn't nowoman strove harder than Addie to make them right,man and boy: 111 say that for her."
10043,4,"""It was full of blood and guts as a hog,"" he says.But I just cant seem to get no heart into anything,with this here weather sapping me, too."
10044,4,"""Pa,"" he says,""is ma sick some more?"" ""Go wash them hands,"" I say."
10045,4,"But I just cant seem to get no heart into it.DarlHe has been to town this week: the back of his neck is trimmed close, with a white line between hair and sunburn like a joint of white bone."
10046,4,"He has not once looked back.""Jewel,"" I say."
10047,4,"Back running, tunnelled between the two sets of bobbing mule ears, the road vanishes beneath the wagon as though it were a ribbon and the front axle were a spool."
10048,4,"""Do you know she is going to die, Jewel?""It takes two people to make you, and one people to die."
10049,4,"That's how the world is going to end.I said to Dewey Dell: ""You want her to die so you can get to town: is that it?"" She wouldn't say what we both knew."
10050,4,"""The reason you will not say it is, when you say it, even to yourself, you will know it is true: is that it? But you know it is true now."
10051,4,I can almost tell you the day when you knew it is true.
10052,4,"Why wont you say it, even to yourself?"" She will not say it."
10053,4,"She just keeps on saying Are you going to tell pa? Are you going to kill him? ""You cannot believe it is true because you cannot believe that Dewey Dell, Dewey Dell Bundren, could have such bad luck: is that it?""The sun, an hour above the horizon, is poised like a bloody egg upon a crest of thunderheads; the light has turned copper: in the eye portentous, in the nose sulphurous, smelling of lightning."
10054,4,"When Peabody comes, they will have to use the rope."
10055,4,He has pussel-gutted himself eating cold greens.
10056,4,"With the rope they will haul him up the path, balloon-like up the sulphurous air.""Jewel,"" I say, ""do you know that Addie Bundren is going to die? Addie Bundren is going to die?""PeabodyWhen Anse finally sent for me of his own accord, I said ""He has wore her out at last."" And I said a damn good thing, and at first I would not go because there might be something I could do and I would have to haul her back, by God."
10057,4,"I thought maybe they have the same sort of fool ethics in heaven they have in the Medical College and that it was maybe Vernon lull sending for me again, getting me there in the nick of time, as Vernom always does things, getting the most for Anse's money like he does for his own."
10058,4,But when it got far enough into the day for me to read weather sign I knew it couldn't have been anybody but Anse that sent.
10059,4,I knew that nobody but a luckless man could ever need a doctor in the face of a cyclone.
10060,4,"And I knew that if it had finally occurred to Anse himself that he needed one, it was already too late.When I reach the spring and get down and hitch the team, the sun has gone down behind a bank of black cloud like a topheavy mountain range, like a load of cinders dumped over there, and there is no wind."
10061,4,I could hear Cash sawing for a mile before I got there.
10062,4,Anse is standing at the top of the bluff above the path.
10063,4,"""Where's the horse?"" I say.""Jewel's taken and gone,"" he says."
10064,4,"""Cant nobody else ketch hit."
10065,4,"You'll have to walk up, I reckon.""""Me, walk up, weighing two hundred and twenty-five pounds?"" I say."
10066,4,"""Walk up that durn wall?"" He stands there beside a tree."
10067,4,Too bad the Lord made the mistake of giving trees roots and giving the Anse Bundrens He makes feet and legs.
10068,4,"If He'd just swapped them, there wouldn't ever be a worry about this country being deforested someday."
10069,4,Or any other country.
10070,4,"""What do you aim for me to do?"" I say."
10071,4,"""Stay here and get blowed clean out .of the county when that cloud breaks?"" Even with the horse it would take me fifteen minutes to ride up across the pasture to the top of the ridge and reach the house."
10072,4,The path looks like a crooked limb blown against the bluff.
10073,4,Anse has not been in town in twelve years.
10074,4,"And how his mother ever got up there to bear him, he being his mother's son.""Vardaman's gittin the rope,"" he says."
10075,4,After a while Vardaman appears with the plowline.
10076,4,"He gives the end of it to Anse and comes down the path, uncoiling it.""You hold it tight,"" I say."
10077,4,"""I done already wrote this visit onto my books, so I'm going to charge you just the same, whether I get there or not.""""I got hit,"" Anse says."
10078,4,"""You kin come on up.""I'll be damned if I can see why I dont quit."
10079,4,"A man seventy years old, weighing two hundred and odd pounds, being hauled up and down a damn mountain on a rope."
10080,4,I reckon it's because I must reach the fifty thousand dollar mark of dead accounts on my books before I can quit.
10081,4,"""What the hell does your wife mean,"" I say, ""taking sick on top of a durn mountain?""""I'm right sorry,"" he says."
10082,4,"He let the rope go, just dropped it, and he has turned toward the house."
10083,4,"There is a little daylight up here still, of the color of sulphur matches."
10084,4,The boards look like strips of sulphur.
10085,4,Cash does not look back.
10086,4,"Vernon Tull says he brings each , board up to the window for her to see it and say it is all right."
10087,4,The boy overtakes us.
10088,4,Anse looks back at him.
10089,4,"""Where's the rope?"" he says.""It's where you left it,"" I say."
10090,4,"""But never you mind that rope."
10091,4,I got to get back down that bluff.
10092,4,I dont aim for that storm to catch me up here.
10093,4,"Td blow too durn far once I got started.""The girl is standing by the bed, fanning her."
10094,4,When we enter she turns her head and looks at us.
10095,4,She has been dead these ten days.
10096,4,"I suppose it's having been a part of Anse for so long that she cannot even make that change, if change it be."
10097,4,I can remember how when I was young I believed death to be a phenomenon of the body; now I know it to be merely a function of the mind and that of the minds of the ones who suffer the bereavement.
10098,4,"The nihilists say it is the end; the fundamentalists, the beginning; when in reality it is no more than a single tenant or family moving out of a tenement or a town.She looks at us."
10099,4,Only her eyes seem to move.
10100,4,"It's like they touch us, not with sight or sense, but like the stream from a hose touches you, the stream at the instant of impact as dissociated from the nozzle as though it had never been there."
10101,4,She does not look at Anse at all.
10102,4,"She looks at me, then at the boy."
10103,4,"Beneath the quilt she is no more than a bundle of rotten sticks,""Well, Miss Addie,"" I say."
10104,4,The girl does not stop the fan.
10105,4,"""How are you, sister?"" I say."
10106,4,"Her head lies gaunt on the pillow, looking at the boy."
10107,4,"""You picked out a fine time to get me out here and bring up a storm."" Then I send Anse and the boy out."
10108,4,She watches the boy as he leaves the room.
10109,4,"She has not moved save her eyes.He and Anse are on the porch when I come out, the boy sitting on the steps, Anse standing by a post, not even leaning against it, his arms dangling, the hair pushed and matted up on his head like a dipped rooster."
10110,4,"He turns his head, bunking at me.""Why didn't you send for me sooner?"" I say.""Hit was jest one thing and then another,"" he says."
10111,4,"'That ere corn me and the boys was aimin to git up with, and Dewey Dell a-takin good keer of her, and folks comin in, a-offerin to help and sich, till I jest thought ."
10112,4,.
10113,4,".""""Damn the money,"" I say."
10114,4,"""Did you ever hear of me worrying a fellow before he was ready to pay?""""Hit aint begrudgin the money,"" he says."
10115,4,"""I jest kept a-thinkin ."
10116,4,.
10117,4,.
10118,4,"She's goin, is she?"" The durn little tyke is sitting on the top step, looking smaller than ever in the sulphur-colored light."
10119,4,"That's the one trouble with this country: everything, weather, all, hangs on too long."
10120,4,"Like our rivers, our land: opaque, slow, violent; shaping and creating the Me of man in its implacable and brooding image."
10121,4,"""I knowed hit,"" Anse says."
10122,4,"""All the while I made sho."
10123,4,"Her mind is sot on hit.""""And a damn good thing, too,"" I say."
10124,4,"""With a trifling"" He sits on the top step, small, motionless in faded overalls."
10125,4,"When I came out he looked up at me, then at Anse."
10126,4,But now he has stopped looking at us.
10127,4,"He just sits there.""Have you told her yit?"" Anse says.""What for?"" I say."
10128,4,"""What the devil for?""""Shell know hit."
10129,4,"I knowed that when she see you she would know hit, same as writing."
10130,4,You wouldn't need to tell her.
10131,4,"Her mind""Behind us the girl says, ""Paw."" I look at her, at her face.""You better go quick,"" I say.When we enter the room she is watching the door."
10132,4,She looks at me.
10133,4,Her eyes look like lamps blaring up just before the oil is gone.
10134,4,"""She wants you to go out,"" the girl says.""Now, Addie,"" Anse says, ""when he come all the way from Jefferson to git you well?"" She watches me: I can feel her eyes."
10135,4,It's like she was shoving at me with them.
10136,4,I have seen it before in women.
10137,4,"Seen them drive from the room them coming with sympathy and pity, with actual help, and clinging to some trifling animal to whom they never were more than pack-horses."
10138,4,"That's what they mean by the love that passeth understanding: that pride, that furious desire to hide that abject nakedness which we bring here with us, carry with us into operating rooms, carry stubbornly and furiously with us into the earth again."
10139,4,I leave the room.
10140,4,Beyond the porch Cash's saw snores steadily into the board.
10141,4,"A minute later she calls his name, her voice harsh and strong."
10142,4,"""Cash,"" she says; ""you, Cashl""DarlPa stands beside the bed."
10143,4,"From behind his leg Vardaman peers, with his round head and his eyes round and his mouth beginning to open."
10144,4,"She looks at pa; all her failing life appears to drain into her eyes, urgent, irremediable."
10145,4,"""It's Jewel she wants,"" Dewey Dell says.""Why, Addle,"" pa says, ""him and Darl went to make one more load."
10146,4,They thought there was time.
10147,4,"That you would wait for them, and that three dollars and all ..."" He stoops laying his hand on hers."
10148,4,"For a while yet she looks at him, without reproach, without anything at all, as if her eyes alone are listening to the irrevocable cessation of his voice."
10149,4,"Then she raisesherself, who has not moved in ten days."
10150,4,"Dewey Dell leans down, trying to press her back.""Ma,"" she says; ""ma.""She is looking out the window, at Cash stooping steadily at the board in the failing light, laboring on toward darkness and into it as though the stroking of the saw illumined its own motion, board and saw engendered.""You, Cash,"" she shouts, her voice harsh, strong, and unimpaired."
10151,4,"""You, Cash!""He looks up at the gaunt face framed by the window in the twilight."
10152,4,It is a composite picture of all time since he was a child.
10153,4,"He drops the saw and lifts the board for her to see, watching the window in which the face has not moved."
10154,4,"He drags a second plank into position and slants the two of them into their final juxtaposition, gesturing toward the ones yet on the ground, shaping with his empty hand in pantomime the finished box."
10155,4,"For a while still she looks down at him from the composite picture, neither with censure nor approbation."
10156,4,Then the face disappears.She lies back and turns her head without so much as glancing at pa.
10157,4,"She looks at Vardaman; her eyes, the life in them, rushing suddenly upon them; the two flames glare up for a steady instant."
10158,4,"Then they go out as though someone had leaned down and blown upon them.""Ma,"" Dewey Dell says; ""ma!"" Leaning above the bed, her hands lifted a little, the fan still moving like it has for ten days, she begins to keen."
10159,4,"Her voice is strong, young, tremulous and clear, rapt with its own timbre and volume, the fan still moving steadily up and down, whispering the useless air."
10160,4,"Then she flings herself across Addle Bundren's knees, clutching her, j shaking her with the furious strength of the young before sprawling suddenly across the handful of rotten bones that Addie Bundren left, jarring the whole bed into a chattering sibilance of mattress shucks, her arms outflung and the fan in one hand still beating with expiring breath into the quiltFrom behind pa's leg Vardaman peers, his mouth full open and all color draining from his face into his mouth, as though he has by some means fleshed his own teeth in himself, sucking."
10161,4,"He begins to move slowly backward from the bed, his eyes round, his pale face fading into the dusk like a piece of paper pasted on a failing wall, and so out of the door.Pa leans above the bed in the twilight, his humped silhouette partaking of that owl-like quality of awry-feathered, disgruntled outrage within which lurks a wisdom too profound or too inert for even thought."
10162,4,"""Durn them boys,"" he says.Jewel, I say."
10163,4,"Overhead the day drives level and gray, hiding the sun by a flight of gray spears."
10164,4,"In the rain the mules smoke a little, splashed yellow with mud, the off one clinging in sliding lunges to the side of the road above the ditch."
10165,4,"The tilted lumber gleams dull yellow, water-soaked and heavy as lead, tilted at a steep angle into the ditch above the broken wheel; about the shattered spokes and about Jewel's, ankles a runnel of yellow neither water nor earth swirls, curving with the yellow road neither of earth nor water, down the hill dissolving into a streaming mass of dark green neither of earth nor sky."
10166,4,"Jewel, I say Cash comes to the door, carrying the saw."
10167,4,"Pa stands beside the bed, humped, his arms dangling."
10168,4,"He turns his head, his shabby profile, his chin collapsing slowly as he works the snuff against his gums."
10169,4,"'""She's gone,"" Cash says.""She taken and left us,"" pa says."
10170,4,Cash does not look at him.
10171,4,"""How nigh are you done?"" pa says."
10172,4,Cash does not answer.
10173,4,"He enters, carrying the saw."
10174,4,"""I reckon you better get at it,"" pa says."
10175,4,"""You'll have to do the best you can, with them boys gone off that-a-way."" Cash looks down at her face."
10176,4,He is not listening to pa at all.
10177,4,He does not approach the bed.
10178,4,"He stops in the middle of the floor, the saw against his leg, his sweating arms powdered lightly with sawdust, his face composed."
10179,4,"""If you get in a tight, maybe some of themll get here tomorrow and help you,"" pa says."
10180,4,"""Vernon could."" Cash is not listening."
10181,4,"He is looking down at her peaceful, rigid face fading into the dusk as though darkness were a precursor of the ultimate earth, until at last the face seems to float detached upon it, lightly as the reflection of a dead leaf."
10182,4,"""There is Christians enough to help you,"" pa says."
10183,4,Cash is not listening.
10184,4,After a while he turns without looking at pa and leaves the room.
10185,4,Then the saw begins to snore again.
10186,4,"""They will help us in our sorrow,"" pa says.The sound of the saw is steady, competent, unhurried, stirring the dying light so that at each stroke her face seems to wake a little into an expression of listening and of waiting, as though she were counting the strokes."
10187,4,"Pa looks down at the face, at the black sprawl of Dewey Dell's hair, the outflung arms, the clutched fan now motionless on the fading quilt."
10188,4,"""I reckon you better get supper on,"" he says."
10189,4,Dewey Dell does not move.
10190,4,"""Git up, now, and put supper on,"" pa says."
10191,4,"""We got to keep our strength up."
10192,4,"I reckon Doctor Pea-body's right hungry, coming all this way."
10193,4,"And Cash'11 need to eat quick and get back to work so he can finish it in time.""Dewey Dell rises, heaving to her feet."
10194,4,She looks down at the face.
10195,4,"It is like a casting of fading bronze upon the pillow, the hands alone still with any semblance of life: a curled, gnarled ineptness; a spent yet alert quality from which weariness, exhaustion, travail has not yet departed, as though they doubted even yet the actuality of rest, guarding with horned and penurious alertness the cessation which they know cannot last.Dewey Dell stoops and slides the quilt from beneath them and draws it up over them to the chin, smoothing it down, drawing it smooth."
10196,4,"Then without looking at pa she goes around the bed and leaves the room._She will go out where Peabody is, where she can stand in the twilight and look at his back with such an expression that, feeling her eyes and turning, he will say: I would not let it grieve me, now."
10197,4,"She was old, and sick too."
10198,4,Suffering more than we knew.
10199,4,She couldn't have got well.
10200,4,"Vardaman's getting big now, and with you to take good care of them all."
10201,4,I would try not to let it grieve me.
10202,4,I expect you'd better go and get some supper ready.
10203,4,It dont have to be much.
10204,4,"But they'll need to eat, and she looking at him, saying You could do so much for me if you just would."
10205,4,If you just knew.
10206,4,"I am I and you are you and I know it and you dont know it and you could do so much for me if you just would and if you just would then I could tell you and then nobody would have to know it except you and me and Darl_Pa stands over the bed, dangle-armed, humped, motionless."
10207,4,"He raises his hand to his head, scouring his hair, listening to the saw."
10208,4,"He comes nearer and rubs his hand, palm and back, on his thigh and lays it on her face and then on the hump of quilt where her hands are."
10209,4,"He touches the quilt as he saw Dewey Dell do, trying to smoothe it up to the chin, but disarranging it instead."
10210,4,"He tries to smoothe it again, clumsily, his hand awkward as a claw, smoothing at the wrinkles which he made and which continue to emerge beneath his hand with perverse ubiquity, so that at last he desists, his hand falling to his side and stroking itself again, palm and back, on his thigh."
10211,4,The sound of the saw snores steadily into the room.
10212,4,"Pa breathes with a quiet, rasping sound, mouthing the snuff against his gums."
10213,4,"""God's will be done,"" he says."
10214,4,"""Now I can get them teeth.""_Jewel's hat droops limp about his neck, channelling water onto the soaked towsack tied about his shoulders as, ankle-deep in the running ditch, he pries with a slipping two-by-four, with a piece of rotting log for fulcrum, at the axle."
10215,4,"Jewel, I say, she is dead, Jewel."
10216,4,Addie Bundren is dead._VardamanThen I begin to run.
10217,4,I run toward the back and come to the edge of the porch and stop.
10218,4,Then I begin to cry.
10219,4,I can feel where the fish was in the dust.
10220,4,"It is cut up into pieces of not-fish now, not-blood on my hands and overalls."
10221,4,Then it wasn't so.
10222,4,It hadn't happened then.
10223,4,And now she is getting so far ahead I cannot catch her.The trees look like chickens when they ruffle out into the cool dust on the hot days.
10224,4,"If I jump off the porch I will be where the fish was, and it all cut up into not-fish now."
10225,4,I can hear the bed and her face and them and I can feel the floor shake when he walks on it that came and did it.
10226,4,"That came and did it when she was all right but he came and did it.""The fat son of a bitch.""I jump from the porch, running."
10227,4,The top of the barn comes swooping up out of the twilight.
10228,4,"If I jump I can go through it like the pink lady in the circus, into the warm smelling, without having to wait My hands grab at the bushes; beneath my feet the rocks and dirt go rubbling down.Then I can breathe again, in the warm smelling."
10229,4,"I enter the stall, trying to touch him, and then I can cry then I vomit the crying."
10230,4,"As soon as he gets through, kicking I can and then I can cry, the crying can.""He kilt her."
10231,4,"He kilt her.""The Me in him runs under the skin, under my hand, running through the splotches, smelling up into my nose where the sickness is beginning to cry, vomiting the crying, and then I can breathe, vomiting it."
10232,4,It makes a lot of noise.
10233,4,"I can smell the life running up from under my hands, up my arms, and then I cart leave the stall.I cannot find it."
10234,4,"In the dark, along the dust, the walls I cannot find it."
10235,4,The crying makes a lot of noise.
10236,4,I wish it wouldn't make so much noise.
10237,4,"Then I find it in the wagon shed, in the dust, and I run across the lot and into the road, the stick jouncing on my shoulder.They watch me as I run up, beginning to jerk back, their eyes rolling, snorting, jerking back on the hitch-rein."
10238,4,I strike.
10239,4,"I can hear the stick striking; I can see it hitting their heads, the breast-yoke, missing altogether sometimes as they rear and plunge, but I am glad.""You kilt my mawThe stick breaks, they rearing and snorting, their feet popping loud on the ground; loud because it is going to rain and the air is empty for the rain."
10240,4,But it is still long enough.
10241,4,"I run this way and that as they rear and jerk at the hitch-rein, striking.""You kilt her!""I strike at them, striking, they wheeling in a long lunge, the buggy wheeling onto two wheels and motionless like it is nailed to the ground and the horses motionless like they are nailed by the hind feet to the center of a whirling plate.I run in the dust.."
10242,4,"I cannot see, running in the sucking dust where the buggy vanishes tilted on two wheels."
10243,4,"I strike, the stick hitting into the ground, bouncing, striking into the dust and then into the air again and the dust sucking on down the road faster than if a car was in it."
10244,4,"And then I can cry, looking at the stick."
10245,4,"It is broken down to my hand, not longer than stove wood that was a long stick."
10246,4,I throw it away and I can cry.
10247,4,"It does not make so much noise now.The cow is standing in the barn door, chewing."
10248,4,"When she sees me come into the lot she lows, her mouth full of flopping green, her tongue flopping.""I aint a-goin to milk you."
10249,4,"I aint a-goin to do nothing for them.""I hear her turn when I pass."
10250,4,"When I turn she is just behind me with her sweet, hot, hard breath.""Didn't I tell you I wouldn't?""She nudges me, snuffing."
10251,4,"She moans deep inside, her mouth closed."
10252,4,"I jerk my hand, cursing her like Jewel does.""Git, now.""I stoop my hand to the ground and run at her."
10253,4,"She jumps back and whirls away and stops, watching me."
10254,4,She moans.
10255,4,She goes on.
10256,4,"to the path and stands there, looking up the path.It is dark in the barn, warm, smelling, silent."
10257,4,"I can cry quietly, watching the top of the hill.Cash comes to the hill, limping where he fell off of the church."
10258,4,"He looks down at the spring, then up the road and back toward the barn."
10259,4,"He comes down the path stiffly and looks at the broken hitch-rein and at the dust in the road and then up the road, where the dust is gone.""I hope they've got clean past Tull's by now."
10260,4,"I so hope hit.""Cash turns and limps up the path.""Durn him."
10261,4,I showed him.
10262,4,"Durn him.""I am not crying now."
10263,4,I am not anything.
10264,4,Dewey Dell comes to the hill and calls me.
10265,4,Vardaman.
10266,4,I am not anything.
10267,4,I am quiet.
10268,4,"You, Vardaman."
10269,4,"I can cry quiet now, feeling and hearing my tears.""Then hit want."
10270,4,Hit hadn't happened then.
10271,4,Hit was a-layin right there on the ground.
10272,4,"And now she's git-tin ready to cook hit.""It is dark."
10273,4,"I can hear wood, silence: I know them."
10274,4,"But not living sounds, not even him."
10275,4,"It is as though the dark were resolving him out of his integrity, into an unrelated scattering of components--snuffings and stampings; smells of cooling flesh and ammoniac hair; an illusion of a co-ordinated whole of splotched hide and strong bones within which, detached and secret and familiar, an is different from my is."
10276,4,"I see him dissolve--legs, a rolling eye, a gaudy splotching like cold flames and float upon the dark in fading solution; all one yet neither; all either yet none."
10277,4,"I can see hearing coil toward him, caressing, shaping his hard shape--fetlock, hip, shoulder and head; smell and sound."
10278,4,"I am not afraid.""Cooked and et."
10279,4,"Cooked and et""Dewey DellHe could do so much for me if he just would."
10280,4,He could do everything for me.
10281,4,"It's like everything in the world for me is inside a tub full of guts, so that you wonder how there can be any room in it for anything else very important."
10282,4,"He is a big tub of guts and I am a little tub of guts and if there is not any room for , anything else important in a big tub of guts, how can it be room in a little tub of guts."
10283,4,But I know it is there because God gave women a sign when something has happened bad.It's because I am alone.
10284,4,"If I could just feel it, it would be different, because I would not be alone."
10285,4,"But if I were not alone, everybody would know it."
10286,4,"And he could do so much for me, and then I would not be alone."
10287,4,"Then I could be all right alone.I would let him come in between me and Lafe, like Darl came in between me and Lafe, and so Lafe is alone too."
10288,4,"He is Lafe and I am Dewey Dell, and when mother died I had to go beyond and outside of me and Lafe and Darl to grieve because he could do so much for me and he dont know it."
10289,4,He dont even know it.From the back porch I cannot see the barn.
10290,4,Then the sound of Cash's sawing comes in from that way.
10291,4,"It is like a dog outside the house, going back and forth around the house to whatever door you come to, waiting to come in."
10292,4,He said I worry more than you do and I said You dont know what worry is so I cant worry.
10293,4,I try to but I cant think long enough to worry.I light the kitchen lamp.
10294,4,"The fish, cut into jagged pieces, bleeds quietly in the pan."
10295,4,"I put it into the cupboard quick, listening into the hall, hearing."
10296,4,It took her ten days to die; maybe she dont know it is yet.
10297,4,Maybe she wont go until Cash.
10298,4,Or maybe until Jewel.
10299,4,"I take the dish of greens from the cupboard and the bread pan from the cold stove, and I stop, watching the door.""Where's Vardaman?"" Cash says."
10300,4,"In the lamp his sawdusted arms look like sand.""I dont know."
10301,4,"I aint seen him.""Peabody's team run away."
10302,4,See if you can find Vardaman.
10303,4,"The horse will let him catch him.""""Well."
10304,4,"Tell them to come to supper.""I cannot see the barn."
10305,4,"I said, I dont know how to worry."
10306,4,I dont know how to cry.
10307,4,"I tried, but I cant."
10308,4,"After a while the sound of the saw comes around, coming dark along the ground in the dust-dark."
10309,4,"Then I can see him, going up and down above the plank."
10310,4,"""You come in to supper,"" I say."
10311,4,"""Tell him."" He could do everything for me."
10312,4,And he dont know it.
10313,4,He is his guts and I am my guts.
10314,4,And I am Lafe's guts.
10315,4,That's it.
10316,4,I dont see why he didn't stay in town.
10317,4,"We are country people, not as good as town people."
10318,4,I dont see why he didn't.
10319,4,Then I can see the top of the barn.
10320,4,"The cow stands at the foot of the path, lowing."
10321,4,"When I turn back, Cash is gone.I carry the buttermilk in."
10322,4,"Pa and Cash and he are at the table.""Where's that big fish Bud caught, sister?"" he says."
10323,4,I set the milk on the table.
10324,4,"""I never had no time to cook it.""""Plain turnip greens is mighty spindling eating for a man my size,"" he says."
10325,4,Cash is eating.
10326,4,About his head the print of his hat is sweated into his hair.
10327,4,His shirt is blotched with sweat.
10328,4,"He has not washed his hands and arms.""You ought to took time,"" pa says."
10329,4,"""Where's Vardaman?""I go toward the door."
10330,4,"""I cant find him."" ""Here, sister,"" he says; ""never mind about the fish."
10331,4,"It'll save, I reckon."
10332,4,"Come on and sit down.""""I aint minding it,"" I say."
10333,4,"""I'm going to milk before it sets in to rain.""Pa helps himself and pushes the dish on."
10334,4,But he does not begin to eat.
10335,4,"His hands are halfclosed on either side of his plate, his head bowed a little, his awry hair standing into the lamplight."
10336,4,"He looks like right after the maul hits the steer and it no longer alive and dont yet know that it is dead.But Cash is eating, and he is too."
10337,4,"""You better eat something,"" he says."
10338,4,He is looking at pa.
10339,4,"""Like Cash and me."
10340,4,"You'll need it.""""Ay,"" pa says."
10341,4,"He rouses up, like a steer that's been kneeling in a pond and you run at it ""She would not begrudge me it""When I am out of sight of the house, I go fast."
10342,4,The cow lows at the foot of the bluff.
10343,4,"She nuzzles at me, snuffing, blowing her breath in a sweet, hot blast, through my dress, against my hot nakedness, moaning."
10344,4,"""You got to wait a little while."
10345,4,"Then I'll tend to you."" She follows me into the barn where I set the bucket down."
10346,4,"She breathes into the bucket, moaning."

10354,4,"I have almost passed it, I listen to it saying for a long time before it can say the word and the listening part is afraid that there may not be time to say it I feel my body, my bones and flesh beginning to part and open upon the alone, and the process of coming unalone is terrible."

10455,4,"It had been a misdoubtful night, with the storm making; a night when a fellow looks for most anything to happen before he can get the stock fed and himself to the house and supper et and in bed with the rain starting, and when Peabody's team come up, lathered, with the broke harness dragging and the neck-yoke betwixt the off critter's legs, Cora says ""It's Addie Bundren."

10467,4,"Even while I was going to the door with the lamp and it shining on the glass so he could see I am coming, it kept on knocking."
10468,4,"Not loud, but steady, like he might have gone to sleep thumping, but I never noticed how low down on the door the knocking was till I opened it and never seen nothing."
10469,4,"I held the lamp up, with the rain sparkling across it and Cora back in the hall saying ""Who is it, Vernon?"" but I couldn't see nobody a-tall at first until I looked down and around the door, lowering the lamp.He looked like a drownded puppy, in them overalls, without no hat, splashed up to his knees where he had walked them four miles in the mud."
10470,4,"""Well, 111 bedurned,"" I says.""Who is it, Vernon?"" Cora says.He looked at me, his eyes round and black in the middle like when you throw a light in a owl's face."

10472,4,"""What is it? Is your maw""""Vernon,"" Cora says.He stood kind of around behind the door, in the dark."
10473,4,"The rain was blowing onto the lamp, hissing on it so I am scared every minute it'll break."

10475,4,"""You seen it.""Then Cora come to the door."
10476,4,"""You come right in outen the rain,"" she says, pulling him in and him watching me."
10477,4,He looked just like a drownded puppy.

10479,4,"""I told you it was a-happening."
10480,4,"You go and hitch."" ""But he aint said"" I says.He looked at me, dripping onto the floor."
10481,4,"""He's a-ruining the rug,"" Cora says."
10482,4,"""You go get the team while I take him to the kitchen.""But he hung back, dripping, watching me with them eyes."
10483,4,"""You was there."
10484,4,You seen it laying there.
10485,4,Cash is fixing to nail her up; and it was a-laying right there on the ground.
10486,4,You seen it.
10487,4,You seen the mark in the dirt.
10488,4,The rain never come up till after I was a-coming here.
10489,4,"So we can get back in time.""I be durn if it didn't give me the creeps, even when I didn't know yet."
10490,4,But Cora did.
10491,4,"""You get that team quick as you can,"" she says."
10492,4,"""He's outen his head with grief and worry.""I be durn if it didn't give me the creeps."
10493,4,Now and then a fellow gets to thinking.
10494,4,"About all the sorrow and afflictions in this world; how it's liable to strike anywhere, like lightning."
10495,4,"I reckon it does take a powerful trust in the Lord to guard a fellow, though sometimes I think that Cora's a mite over-cautious, like she was trying to crowd the other folks away and get in closer than anybody else."
10496,4,"But then, when something like this happens, I reckon she is right and you got to keep after it and I reckon I am blessed in having a wife that ever strives for sanctify and well-doing likeshe says I am.Now and then a fellow gets to thinking about it Not often, thoug."
10497,5,"I had the story, bit by bit, from various people, and, as generallyhappens in such cases, each time it was a different story.If you know Starkfield, Massachusetts, you know the post-office."
10498,5,"If youknow the post-office you must have seen Ethan Frome drive up to it, dropthe reins on his hollow-backed bay and drag himself across the brickpavement to the white colonnade; and you must have asked who he was.It was there that, several years ago, I saw him for the first time; andthe sight pulled me up sharp."
10499,5,"Even then he was the most striking figurein Starkfield, though he was but the ruin of a man."
10500,5,"It was not so muchhis great height that marked him, for the “natives” were easily singledout by their lank longitude from the stockier foreign breed: it was thecareless powerful look he had, in spite of a lameness checking each steplike the jerk of a chain."
10501,5,"There was something bleak and unapproachablein his face, and he was so stiffened and grizzled that I took him for anold man and was surprised to hear that he was not more than fifty-two.I had this from Harmon Gow, who had driven the stage from Bettsbridgeto Starkfield in pre-trolley days and knew the chronicle of all thefamilies on his line.“He's looked that way ever since he had his smash-up; and that'stwenty-four years ago come next February,” Harmon threw out betweenreminiscent pauses.The “smash-up” it was--I gathered from the same informant--which, besidesdrawing the red gash across Ethan Frome's forehead, had so shortened andwarped his right side that it cost him a visible effort to take the fewsteps from his buggy to the post-office window."
10502,5,"He used to drive infrom his farm every day at about noon, and as that was my own hour forfetching my mail I often passed him in the porch or stood beside himwhile we waited on the motions of the distributing hand behind thegrating."
10503,5,"I noticed that, though he came so punctually, he seldomreceived anything but a copy of the Bettsbridge Eagle, which he putwithout a glance into his sagging pocket."
10504,5,"At intervals, however, thepost-master would hand him an envelope addressed to Mrs."
10505,5,"Zenobia--or Mrs.Zeena--Frome, and usually bearing conspicuously in the upper left-handcorner the address of some manufacturer of patent medicine and the nameof his specific."
10506,5,"These documents my neighbour would also pocket withouta glance, as if too much used to them to wonder at their number andvariety, and would then turn away with a silent nod to the post-master.Every one in Starkfield knew him and gave him a greeting tempered tohis own grave mien; but his taciturnity was respected and it was only onrare occasions that one of the older men of the place detained him fora word."
10507,5,"When this happened he would listen quietly, his blue eyes on thespeaker's face, and answer in so low a tone that his words never reachedme; then he would climb stiffly into his buggy, gather up the reins inhis left hand and drive slowly away in the direction of his farm.“It was a pretty bad smash-up?” I questioned Harmon, looking afterFrome's retreating figure, and thinking how gallantly his lean brownhead, with its shock of light hair, must have sat on his strongshoulders before they were bent out of shape.“Wust kind,” my informant assented."
10508,5,“More'n enough to kill most men.
10509,5,Butthe Fromes are tough.
10510,5,Ethan'll likely touch a hundred.”“Good God!” I exclaimed.
10511,5,"At the moment Ethan Frome, after climbing tohis seat, had leaned over to assure himself of the security of a woodenbox--also with a druggist's label on it--which he had placed in the backof the buggy, and I saw his face as it probably looked when he thoughthimself alone."
10512,5,"“That man touch a hundred? He looks as if he was dead andin hell now!”Harmon drew a slab of tobacco from his pocket, cut off a wedge andpressed it into the leather pouch of his cheek."
10513,5,“Guess he's been inStarkfield too many winters.
10514,5,Most of the smart ones get away.”“Why didn't he?”“Somebody had to stay and care for the folks.
10515,5,There warn't ever anybodybut Ethan.
10516,5,Fust his father--then his mother--then his wife.”“And then the smash-up?”Harmon chuckled sardonically.
10517,5,“That's so.
10518,5,He had to stay then.”“I see.
10519,5,And since then they've had to care for him?”Harmon thoughtfully passed his tobacco to the other cheek.
10520,5,"“Oh, as tothat: I guess it's always Ethan done the caring.”Though Harmon Gow developed the tale as far as his mental and moralreach permitted there were perceptible gaps between his facts, and I hadthe sense that the deeper meaning of the story was in the gaps."
10521,5,"Butone phrase stuck in my memory and served as the nucleus about which Igrouped my subsequent inferences: “Guess he's been in Starkfield toomany winters.”Before my own time there was up I had learned to know what that meant.Yet I had come in the degenerate day of trolley, bicycle and ruraldelivery, when communication was easy between the scattered mountainvillages, and the bigger towns in the valleys, such as Bettsbridge andShadd's Falls, had libraries, theatres and Y."

10525,5,halls to whichthe youth of the hills could descend for recreation.
10526,5,"But when wintershut down on Starkfield and the village lay under a sheet of snowperpetually renewed from the pale skies, I began to see what lifethere--or rather its negation--must have been in Ethan Frome's youngmanhood.I had been sent up by my employers on a job connected with the bigpower-house at Corbury Junction, and a long-drawn carpenters' strikehad so delayed the work that I found myself anchored at Starkfield--thenearest habitable spot--for the best part of the winter."
10527,5,"I chafed atfirst, and then, under the hypnotising effect of routine, graduallybegan to find a grim satisfaction in the life."
10528,5,During the early part ofmy stay I had been struck by the contrast between the vitality ofthe climate and the deadness of the community.
10529,5,"Day by day, after theDecember snows were over, a blazing blue sky poured down torrentsof light and air on the white landscape, which gave them back in anintenser glitter."
10530,5,One would have supposed that such an atmosphere mustquicken the emotions as well as the blood; but it seemed to produceno change except that of retarding still more the sluggish pulse ofStarkfield.
10531,5,"When I had been there a little longer, and had seen thisphase of crystal clearness followed by long stretches of sunless cold;when the storms of February had pitched their white tents about thedevoted village and the wild cavalry of March winds had charged down totheir support; I began to understand why Starkfield emerged from itssix months' siege like a starved garrison capitulating without quarter.Twenty years earlier the means of resistance must have been far fewer,and the enemy in command of almost all the lines of access between thebeleaguered villages; and, considering these things, I felt the sinisterforce of Harmon's phrase: “Most of the smart ones get away.” But if thatwere the case, how could any combination of obstacles have hindered theflight of a man like Ethan Frome?During my stay at Starkfield I lodged with a middle-aged widowcolloquially known as Mrs."
10532,5,Ned Hale.
10533,5,Mrs.
10534,5,"Hale's father had been thevillage lawyer of the previous generation, and “lawyer Varnum's house,” where my landlady still lived with her mother, was the most considerablemansion in the village."
10535,5,"It stood at one end of the main street, itsclassic portico and small-paned windows looking down a flagged pathbetween Norway spruces to the slim white steeple of the Congregationalchurch."
10536,5,"It was clear that the Varnum fortunes were at the ebb, but thetwo women did what they could to preserve a decent dignity; and Mrs.Hale, in particular, had a certain wan refinement not out of keepingwith her pale old-fashioned house.In the “best parlour,” with its black horse-hair and mahogany weaklyilluminated by a gurgling Carcel lamp, I listened every evening toanother and more delicately shaded version of the Starkfield chronicle.It was not that Mrs."
10537,5,"Ned Hale felt, or affected, any social superiorityto the people about her; it was only that the accident of a finersensibility and a little more education had put just enough distancebetween herself and her neighbours to enable her to judge them withdetachment."
10538,5,"She was not unwilling to exercise this faculty, and I hadgreat hopes of getting from her the missing facts of Ethan Frome'sstory, or rather such a key to his character as should co-ordinate thefacts I knew."
10539,5,Her mind was a store-house of innocuous anecdote and anyquestion about her acquaintances brought forth a volume of detail; buton the subject of Ethan Frome I found her unexpectedly reticent.
10540,5,"Therewas no hint of disapproval in her reserve; I merely felt in her aninsurmountable reluctance to speak of him or his affairs, a low “Yes, Iknew them both..."
10541,5,"it was awful...” seeming to be the utmost concessionthat her distress could make to my curiosity.So marked was the change in her manner, such depths of sad initiationdid it imply, that, with some doubts as to my delicacy, I put the caseanew to my village oracle, Harmon Gow; but got for my pains only anuncomprehending grunt.“Ruth Varnum was always as nervous as a rat; and, come to think of it,she was the first one to see 'em after they was picked up."
10542,5,"It happenedright below lawyer Varnum's, down at the bend of the Corbury road, justround about the time that Ruth got engaged to Ned Hale."
10543,5,"The young folkswas all friends, and I guess she just can't bear to talk about it."
10544,5,"She'shad troubles enough of her own.”All the dwellers in Starkfield, as in more notable communities, had hadtroubles enough of their own to make them comparatively indifferent tothose of their neighbours; and though all conceded that Ethan Frome'shad been beyond the common measure, no one gave me an explanation of thelook in his face which, as I persisted in thinking, neither povertynor physical suffering could have put there."
10545,5,"Nevertheless, I might havecontented myself with the story pieced together from these hints hadit not been for the provocation of Mrs."
10546,5,"Hale's silence, and--a littlelater--for the accident of personal contact with the man.On my arrival at Starkfield, Denis Eady, the rich Irish grocer, who wasthe proprietor of Starkfield's nearest approach to a livery stable, hadentered into an agreement to send me over daily to Corbury Flats, whereI had to pick up my train for the Junction."
10547,5,But about the middle of thewinter Eady's horses fell ill of a local epidemic.
10548,5,The illness spreadto the other Starkfield stables and for a day or two I was put to it tofind a means of transport.
10549,5,Then Harmon Gow suggested that Ethan Frome'sbay was still on his legs and that his owner might be glad to drive meover.I stared at the suggestion.
10550,5,“Ethan Frome? But I've never even spoken tohim.
10551,5,Why on earth should he put himself out for me?”Harmon's answer surprised me still more.
10552,5,"“I don't know as he would; butI know he wouldn't be sorry to earn a dollar.”I had been told that Frome was poor, and that the saw-mill and the aridacres of his farm yielded scarcely enough to keep his household throughthe winter; but I had not supposed him to be in such want as Harmon'swords implied, and I expressed my wonder.“Well, matters ain't gone any too well with him,” Harmon said."
10553,5,"“When aman's been setting round like a hulk for twenty years or more, seeingthings that want doing, it eats inter him, and he loses his grit."
10554,5,"ThatFrome farm was always 'bout as bare's a milkpan when the cat's beenround; and you know what one of them old water-mills is wuth nowadays.When Ethan could sweat over 'em both from sunup to dark he kinder chokeda living out of 'em; but his folks ate up most everything, even then,and I don't see how he makes out now."
10555,5,"Fust his father got a kick, outhaying, and went soft in the brain, and gave away money like Bible textsafore he died."
10556,5,"Then his mother got queer and dragged along for years asweak as a baby; and his wife Zeena, she's always been the greatest handat doctoring in the county."
10557,5,"Sickness and trouble: that's what Ethan'shad his plate full up with, ever since the very first helping.”The next morning, when I looked out, I saw the hollow-backed bay betweenthe Varnum spruces, and Ethan Frome, throwing back his worn bearskin,made room for me in the sleigh at his side."
10558,5,"After that, for a week, hedrove me over every morning to Corbury Flats, and on my return in theafternoon met me again and carried me back through the icy night toStarkfield."
10559,5,"The distance each way was barely three miles, but the oldbay's pace was slow, and even with firm snow under the runners we werenearly an hour on the way."
10560,5,"Ethan Frome drove in silence, the reinsloosely held in his left hand, his brown seamed profile, under thehelmet-like peak of the cap, relieved against the banks of snow like thebronze image of a hero."
10561,5,"He never turned his face to mine, oranswered, except in monosyllables, the questions I put, or such slightpleasantries as I ventured."
10562,5,"He seemed a part of the mute melancholylandscape, an incarnation of its frozen woe, with all that was warmand sentient in him fast bound below the surface; but there was nothingunfriendly in his silence."
10563,5,"I simply felt that he lived in a depth ofmoral isolation too remote for casual access, and I had the sense thathis loneliness was not merely the result of his personal plight, tragicas I guessed that to be, but had in it, as Harmon Gow had hinted, theprofound accumulated cold of many Starkfield winters.Only once or twice was the distance between us bridged for a moment;and the glimpses thus gained confirmed my desire to know more."
10564,5,"Once Ihappened to speak of an engineering job I had been on the previous yearin Florida, and of the contrast between the winter landscape about usand that in which I had found myself the year before; and to my surpriseFrome said suddenly: “Yes: I was down there once, and for a good whileafterward I could call up the sight of it in winter."
10565,5,"But now it's allsnowed under.”He said no more, and I had to guess the rest from the inflection of hisvoice and his sharp relapse into silence.Another day, on getting into my train at the Flats, I missed a volumeof popular science--I think it was on some recent discoveries inbio-chemistry--which I had carried with me to read on the way."
10566,5,"I thoughtno more about it till I got into the sleigh again that evening, and sawthe book in Frome's hand.“I found it after you were gone,” he said.I put the volume into my pocket and we dropped back into our usualsilence; but as we began to crawl up the long hill from Corbury Flats tothe Starkfield ridge I became aware in the dusk that he had turned hisface to mine.“There are things in that book that I didn't know the first word about,” he said.I wondered less at his words than at the queer note of resentment inhis voice."
10567,5,"He was evidently surprised and slightly aggrieved at his ownignorance.“Does that sort of thing interest you?” I asked.“It used to.”“There are one or two rather new things in the book: there have beensome big strides lately in that particular line of research.” I waiteda moment for an answer that did not come; then I said: “If you'd like tolook the book through I'd be glad to leave it with you.”He hesitated, and I had the impression that he felt himself about toyield to a stealing tide of inertia; then, “Thank you--I'll take it,” heanswered shortly.I hoped that this incident might set up some more direct communicationbetween us."
10568,5,"Frome was so simple and straightforward that I was sure hiscuriosity about the book was based on a genuine interest in its subject.Such tastes and acquirements in a man of his condition made the contrastmore poignant between his outer situation and his inner needs, and Ihoped that the chance of giving expression to the latter might at leastunseal his lips."
10569,5,"But something in his past history, or in his presentway of living, had apparently driven him too deeply into himself for anycasual impulse to draw him back to his kind."
10570,5,"At our next meeting he madeno allusion to the book, and our intercourse seemed fated to remain asnegative and one-sided as if there had been no break in his reserve.Frome had been driving me over to the Flats for about a week when onemorning I looked out of my window into a thick snow-fall."
10571,5,"The height ofthe white waves massed against the garden-fence and along the wall ofthe church showed that the storm must have been going on all night,and that the drifts were likely to be heavy in the open."
10572,5,"I thoughtit probable that my train would be delayed; but I had to be at thepower-house for an hour or two that afternoon, and I decided, if Frometurned up, to push through to the Flats and wait there till my traincame in."
10573,5,"I don't know why I put it in the conditional, however, for Inever doubted that Frome would appear."
10574,5,"He was not the kind of man to beturned from his business by any commotion of the elements; and atthe appointed hour his sleigh glided up through the snow like astage-apparition behind thickening veils of gauze.I was getting to know him too well to express either wonder or gratitudeat his keeping his appointment; but I exclaimed in surprise as I saw himturn his horse in a direction opposite to that of the Corbury road.“The railroad's blocked by a freight-train that got stuck in a driftbelow the Flats,” he explained, as we jogged off into the stingingwhiteness.“But look here--where are you taking me, then?”“Straight to the Junction, by the shortest way,” he answered, pointingup School House Hill with his whip.“To the Junction--in this storm? Why, it's a good ten miles!”“The bay'll do it if you give him time."
10575,5,You said you had some businessthere this afternoon.
10576,5,"I'll see you get there.”He said it so quietly that I could only answer: “You're doing me thebiggest kind of a favour.”“That's all right,” he rejoined.Abreast of the schoolhouse the road forked, and we dipped down a laneto the left, between hemlock boughs bent inward to their trunks by theweight of the snow."
10577,5,"I had often walked that way on Sundays, and knewthat the solitary roof showing through bare branches near the bottom ofthe hill was that of Frome's saw-mill."
10578,5,"It looked exanimate enough, withits idle wheel looming above the black stream dashed with yellow-whitespume, and its cluster of sheds sagging under their white load."
10579,5,"Fromedid not even turn his head as we drove by, and still in silence we beganto mount the next slope."
10580,5,"About a mile farther, on a road I had nevertravelled, we came to an orchard of starved apple-trees writhing overa hillside among outcroppings of slate that nuzzled up through the snowlike animals pushing out their noses to breathe."
10581,5,"Beyond the orchardlay a field or two, their boundaries lost under drifts; and above thefields, huddled against the white immensities of land and sky, one ofthose lonely New England farm-houses that make the landscape lonelier.“That's my place,” said Frome, with a sideway jerk of his lame elbow;and in the distress and oppression of the scene I did not know what toanswer."
10582,5,"The snow had ceased, and a flash of watery sunlight exposed thehouse on the slope above us in all its plaintive ugliness."
10583,5,"The blackwraith of a deciduous creeper flapped from the porch, and the thinwooden walls, under their worn coat of paint, seemed to shiver in thewind that had risen with the ceasing of the snow.“The house was bigger in my father's time: I had to take down the 'L,'a while back,” Frome continued, checking with a twitch of the left reinthe bay's evident intention of turning in through the broken-down gate.I saw then that the unusually forlorn and stunted look of the house waspartly due to the loss of what is known in New England as the “L”:that long deep-roofed adjunct usually built at right angles to the mainhouse, and connecting it, by way of storerooms and tool-house, with thewood-shed and cow-barn."
10584,5,"Whether because of its symbolic sense, the imageit presents of a life linked with the soil, and enclosing in itself thechief sources of warmth and nourishment, or whether merely becauseof the consolatory thought that it enables the dwellers in that harshclimate to get to their morning's work without facing the weather, itis certain that the “L” rather than the house itself seems to be thecentre, the actual hearth-stone of the New England farm."
10585,5,"Perhaps thisconnection of ideas, which had often occurred to me in my rambles aboutStarkfield, caused me to hear a wistful note in Frome's words, and tosee in the diminished dwelling the image of his own shrunken body.“We're kinder side-tracked here now,” he added, “but there wasconsiderable passing before the railroad was carried through to theFlats.” He roused the lagging bay with another twitch; then, as if themere sight of the house had let me too deeply into his confidence forany farther pretence of reserve, he went on slowly: “I've always setdown the worst of mother's trouble to that."
10586,5,"When she got the rheumatismso bad she couldn't move around she used to sit up there and watch theroad by the hour; and one year, when they was six months mending theBettsbridge pike after the floods, and Harmon Gow had to bring his stageround this way, she picked up so that she used to get down to the gatemost days to see him."
10587,5,"But after the trains begun running nobody evercome by here to speak of, and mother never could get it through her headwhat had happened, and it preyed on her right along till she died.”As we turned into the Corbury road the snow began to fall again, cuttingoff our last glimpse of the house; and Frome's silence fell with it,letting down between us the old veil of reticence."
10588,5,This time the winddid not cease with the return of the snow.
10589,5,"Instead, it sprang up toa gale which now and then, from a tattered sky, flung pale sweeps ofsunlight over a landscape chaotically tossed."
10590,5,"But the bay was as goodas Frome's word, and we pushed on to the Junction through the wild whitescene.In the afternoon the storm held off, and the clearness in the westseemed to my inexperienced eye the pledge of a fair evening."
10591,5,"I finishedmy business as quickly as possible, and we set out for Starkfield witha good chance of getting there for supper."
10592,5,"But at sunset the cloudsgathered again, bringing an earlier night, and the snow began to fallstraight and steadily from a sky without wind, in a soft universaldiffusion more confusing than the gusts and eddies of the morning."
10593,5,"Itseemed to be a part of the thickening darkness, to be the winter nightitself descending on us layer by layer.The small ray of Frome's lantern was soon lost in this smotheringmedium, in which even his sense of direction, and the bay's hominginstinct, finally ceased to serve us."
10594,5,"Two or three times some ghostlylandmark sprang up to warn us that we were astray, and then was suckedback into the mist; and when we finally regained our road the old horsebegan to show signs of exhaustion."
10595,5,"I felt myself to blame for havingaccepted Frome's offer, and after a short discussion I persuaded himto let me get out of the sleigh and walk along through the snow at thebay's side."
10596,5,"In this way we struggled on for another mile or two, andat last reached a point where Frome, peering into what seemed to meformless night, said: “That's my gate down yonder.”The last stretch had been the hardest part of the way."
10597,5,"The bitter coldand the heavy going had nearly knocked the wind out of me, and I couldfeel the horse's side ticking like a clock under my hand.“Look here, Frome,” I began, “there's no earthly use in your going anyfarther--” but he interrupted me: “Nor you neither."
10598,5,"There's been aboutenough of this for anybody.”I understood that he was offering me a night's shelter at the farm, andwithout answering I turned into the gate at his side, and followed himto the barn, where I helped him to unharness and bed down the tiredhorse."
10599,5,"When this was done he unhooked the lantern from the sleigh,stepped out again into the night, and called to me over his shoulder:“This way.”Far off above us a square of light trembled through the screen of snow.Staggering along in Frome's wake I floundered toward it, and in thedarkness almost fell into one of the deep drifts against the front ofthe house."
10600,5,"Frome scrambled up the slippery steps of the porch, digginga way through the snow with his heavily booted foot."
10601,5,"Then he lifted hislantern, found the latch, and led the way into the house."
10602,5,"I wentafter him into a low unlit passage, at the back of which a ladder-likestaircase rose into obscurity."
10603,5,"On our right a line of light marked thedoor of the room which had sent its ray across the night; and behind thedoor I heard a woman's voice droning querulously.Frome stamped on the worn oil-cloth to shake the snow from his boots,and set down his lantern on a kitchen chair which was the only piece offurniture in the hall."
10604,5,"Then he opened the door.“Come in,” he said; and as he spoke the droning voice grew still...It was that night that I found the clue to Ethan Frome, and began to puttogether this vision of his story.IThe village lay under two feet of snow, with drifts at the windycorners."
10605,5,In a sky of iron the points of the Dipper hung like iciclesand Orion flashed his cold fires.
10606,5,"The moon had set, but the night wasso transparent that the white house-fronts between the elms looked grayagainst the snow, clumps of bushes made black stains on it, and thebasement windows of the church sent shafts of yellow light far acrossthe endless undulations.Young Ethan Frome walked at a quick pace along the deserted street, pastthe bank and Michael Eady's new brick store and Lawyer Varnum's housewith the two black Norway spruces at the gate."
10607,5,"Opposite the Varnum gate,where the road fell away toward the Corbury valley, the church rearedits slim white steeple and narrow peristyle."
10608,5,"As the young man walkedtoward it the upper windows drew a black arcade along the side wall ofthe building, but from the lower openings, on the side where the groundsloped steeply down to the Corbury road, the light shot its long bars,illuminating many fresh furrows in the track leading to the basementdoor, and showing, under an adjoining shed, a line of sleighs withheavily blanketed horses.The night was perfectly still, and the air so dry and pure that it gavelittle sensation of cold."
10609,5,"The effect produced on Frome was rather ofa complete absence of atmosphere, as though nothing less tenuous thanether intervened between the white earth under his feet and the metallicdome overhead."
10610,5,"“It's like being in an exhausted receiver,” hethought."
10611,5,"Four or five years earlier he had taken a year's course at atechnological college at Worcester, and dabbled in the laboratory witha friendly professor of physics; and the images supplied by thatexperience still cropped up, at unexpected moments, through the totallydifferent associations of thought in which he had since been living."
10612,5,"Hisfather's death, and the misfortunes following it, had put a prematureend to Ethan's studies; but though they had not gone far enough to beof much practical use they had fed his fancy and made him aware of hugecloudy meanings behind the daily face of things.As he strode along through the snow the sense of such meanings glowed inhis brain and mingled with the bodily flush produced by his sharp tramp.At the end of the village he paused before the darkened front of thechurch."
10613,5,"He stood there a moment, breathing quickly, and looking up anddown the street, in which not another figure moved."
10614,5,"The pitch ofthe Corbury road, below lawyer Varnum's spruces, was the favouritecoasting-ground of Starkfield, and on clear evenings the church cornerrang till late with the shouts of the coasters; but to-night not a sleddarkened the whiteness of the long declivity."
10615,5,"The hush of midnight layon the village, and all its waking life was gathered behind the churchwindows, from which strains of dance-music flowed with the broad bandsof yellow light.The young man, skirting the side of the building, went down the slopetoward the basement door."
10616,5,To keep out of range of the revealing raysfrom within he made a circuit through the untrodden snow and graduallyapproached the farther angle of the basement wall.
10617,5,"Thence, still huggingthe shadow, he edged his way cautiously forward to the nearest window,holding back his straight spare body and craning his neck till he got aglimpse of the room.Seen thus, from the pure and frosty darkness in which he stood, itseemed to be seething in a mist of heat."
10618,5,"The metal reflectors of thegas-jets sent crude waves of light against the whitewashed walls, andthe iron flanks of the stove at the end of the hall looked as thoughthey were heaving with volcanic fires."
10619,5,The floor was thronged withgirls and young men.
10620,5,Down the side wall facing the window stood a row ofkitchen chairs from which the older women had just risen.
10621,5,"By this timethe music had stopped, and the musicians--a fiddler, and the young ladywho played the harmonium on Sundays--were hastily refreshing themselvesat one corner of the supper-table which aligned its devastatedpie-dishes and ice-cream saucers on the platform at the end of the hall.The guests were preparing to leave, and the tide had already set towardthe passage where coats and wraps were hung, when a young man with asprightly foot and a shock of black hair shot into the middle ofthe floor and clapped his hands."
10622,5,"The signal took instant effect.The musicians hurried to their instruments, the dancers--some alreadyhalf-muffled for departure--fell into line down each side of the room,the older spectators slipped back to their chairs, and the lively youngman, after diving about here and there in the throng, drew forth a girlwho had already wound a cherry-coloured “fascinator” about her head,and, leading her up to the end of the floor, whirled her down its lengthto the bounding tune of a Virginia reel.Frome's heart was beating fast."
10623,5,He had been straining for a glimpseof the dark head under the cherry-coloured scarf and it vexed him thatanother eye should have been quicker than his.
10624,5,"The leader of the reel,who looked as if he had Irish blood in his veins, danced well, and hispartner caught his fire."
10625,5,"As she passed down the line, her light figureswinging from hand to hand in circles of increasing swiftness, the scarfflew off her head and stood out behind her shoulders, and Frome, at eachturn, caught sight of her laughing panting lips, the cloud of dark hairabout her forehead, and the dark eyes which seemed the only fixed pointsin a maze of flying lines.The dancers were going faster and faster, and the musicians, to keepup with them, belaboured their instruments like jockeys lashing theirmounts on the home-stretch; yet it seemed to the young man at the windowthat the reel would never end."
10626,5,"Now and then he turned his eyes from thegirl's face to that of her partner, which, in the exhilaration of thedance, had taken on a look of almost impudent ownership."
10627,5,"Denis Eady wasthe son of Michael Eady, the ambitious Irish grocer, whose supplenessand effrontery had given Starkfield its first notion of “smart” businessmethods, and whose new brick store testified to the success of theattempt."
10628,5,"His son seemed likely to follow in his steps, and was meanwhileapplying the same arts to the conquest of the Starkfield maidenhood.Hitherto Ethan Frome had been content to think him a mean fellow; butnow he positively invited a horse-whipping."
10629,5,"It was strange that thegirl did not seem aware of it: that she could lift her rapt face to herdancer's, and drop her hands into his, without appearing to feel theoffence of his look and touch.Frome was in the habit of walking into Starkfield to fetch home hiswife's cousin, Mattie Silver, on the rare evenings when some chance ofamusement drew her to the village."
10630,5,"It was his wife who had suggested,when the girl came to live with them, that such opportunities should beput in her way."
10631,5,"Mattie Silver came from Stamford, and when she enteredthe Fromes' household to act as her cousin Zeena's aid it was thoughtbest, as she came without pay, not to let her feel too sharp a contrastbetween the life she had left and the isolation of a Starkfield farm.But for this--as Frome sardonically reflected--it would hardly haveoccurred to Zeena to take any thought for the girl's amusement.When his wife first proposed that they should give Mattie an occasionalevening out he had inwardly demurred at having to do the extra two milesto the village and back after his hard day on the farm; but not longafterward he had reached the point of wishing that Starkfield might giveall its nights to revelry.Mattie Silver had lived under his roof for a year, and from earlymorning till they met at supper he had frequent chances of seeing her;but no moments in her company were comparable to those when, her arm inhis, and her light step flying to keep time with his long stride, theywalked back through the night to the farm."
10632,5,"He had taken to the girl fromthe first day, when he had driven over to the Flats to meet her, andshe had smiled and waved to him from the train, crying out, “You must beEthan!” as she jumped down with her bundles, while he reflected, lookingover her slight person: “She don't look much on housework, but she ain'ta fretter, anyhow.” But it was not only that the coming to his house ofa bit of hopeful young life was like the lighting of a fire on a coldhearth."
10633,5,The girl was more than the bright serviceable creature he hadthought her.
10634,5,"She had an eye to see and an ear to hear: he could show herthings and tell her things, and taste the bliss of feeling that all heimparted left long reverberations and echoes he could wake at will.It was during their night walks back to the farm that he felt mostintensely the sweetness of this communion."
10635,5,He had always been moresensitive than the people about him to the appeal of natural beauty.
10636,5,Hisunfinished studies had given form to this sensibility and even in hisunhappiest moments field and sky spoke to him with a deep and powerfulpersuasion.
10637,5,"But hitherto the emotion had remained in him as a silentache, veiling with sadness the beauty that evoked it."
10638,5,"He did not evenknow whether any one else in the world felt as he did, or whether hewas the sole victim of this mournful privilege."
10639,5,"Then he learned thatone other spirit had trembled with the same touch of wonder: that at hisside, living under his roof and eating his bread, was a creature to whomhe could say: “That's Orion down yonder; the big fellow to the right isAldebaran, and the bunch of little ones--like bees swarming--they're thePleiades...” or whom he could hold entranced before a ledge of granitethrusting up through the fern while he unrolled the huge panorama of theice age, and the long dim stretches of succeeding time."
10640,5,The fact thatadmiration for his learning mingled with Mattie's wonder at what hetaught was not the least part of his pleasure.
10641,5,"And there were othersensations, less definable but more exquisite, which drew them togetherwith a shock of silent joy: the cold red of sunset behind winterhills, the flight of cloud-flocks over slopes of golden stubble, or theintensely blue shadows of hemlocks on sunlit snow."
10642,5,"When she said to himonce: “It looks just as if it was painted!” it seemed to Ethan that theart of definition could go no farther, and that words had at last beenfound to utter his secret soul....As he stood in the darkness outside the church these memories came backwith the poignancy of vanished things."
10643,5,Watching Mattie whirl down thefloor from hand to hand he wondered how he could ever have thoughtthat his dull talk interested her.
10644,5,"To him, who was never gay but in herpresence, her gaiety seemed plain proof of indifference."
10645,5,"The face shelifted to her dancers was the same which, when she saw him, alwayslooked like a window that has caught the sunset."
10646,5,"He even noticed two orthree gestures which, in his fatuity, he had thought she kept for him:a way of throwing her head back when she was amused, as if to taste herlaugh before she let it out, and a trick of sinking her lids slowly whenanything charmed or moved her.The sight made him unhappy, and his unhappiness roused his latent fears.His wife had never shown any jealousy of Mattie, but of late she hadgrumbled increasingly over the house-work and found oblique ways ofattracting attention to the girl's inefficiency."
10647,5,"Zeena had always beenwhat Starkfield called “sickly,” and Frome had to admit that, if shewere as ailing as she believed, she needed the help of a stronger armthan the one which lay so lightly in his during the night walks to thefarm."
10648,5,"Mattie had no natural turn for housekeeping, and her training haddone nothing to remedy the defect."
10649,5,"She was quick to learn, but forgetfuland dreamy, and not disposed to take the matter seriously."
10650,5,"Ethan hadan idea that if she were to marry a man she was fond of the dormantinstinct would wake, and her pies and biscuits become the pride of thecounty; but domesticity in the abstract did not interest her."
10651,5,At firstshe was so awkward that he could not help laughing at her; but shelaughed with him and that made them better friends.
10652,5,"He did his best tosupplement her unskilled efforts, getting up earlier than usual to lightthe kitchen fire, carrying in the wood overnight, and neglecting themill for the farm that he might help her about the house during the day.He even crept down on Saturday nights to scrub the kitchen floor afterthe women had gone to bed; and Zeena, one day, had surprised him at thechurn and had turned away silently, with one of her queer looks.Of late there had been other signs of her disfavour, as intangible butmore disquieting."
10653,5,"One cold winter morning, as he dressed in the dark,his candle flickering in the draught of the ill-fitting window, he hadheard her speak from the bed behind him.“The doctor don't want I should be left without anybody to do for me,” she said in her flat whine.He had supposed her to be asleep, and the sound of her voice hadstartled him, though she was given to abrupt explosions of speech afterlong intervals of secretive silence.He turned and looked at her where she lay indistinctly outlined underthe dark calico quilt, her high-boned face taking a grayish tinge fromthe whiteness of the pillow.“Nobody to do for you?” he repeated.“If you say you can't afford a hired girl when Mattie goes.”Frome turned away again, and taking up his razor stooped to catch thereflection of his stretched cheek in the blotched looking-glass abovethe wash-stand.“Why on earth should Mattie go?”“Well, when she gets married, I mean,” his wife's drawl came from behindhim.“Oh, she'd never leave us as long as you needed her,” he returned,scraping hard at his chin.“I wouldn't ever have it said that I stood in the way of a poor girllike Mattie marrying a smart fellow like Denis Eady,” Zeena answered ina tone of plaintive self-effacement.Ethan, glaring at his face in the glass, threw his head back to drawthe razor from ear to chin."
10654,5,"His hand was steady, but the attitude was anexcuse for not making an immediate reply.“And the doctor don't want I should be left without anybody,” Zeenacontinued."
10655,5,"“He wanted I should speak to you about a girl he's heardabout, that might come--”Ethan laid down the razor and straightened himself with a laugh.“Denis Eady! If that's all, I guess there's no such hurry to look roundfor a girl.”“Well, I'd like to talk to you about it,” said Zeena obstinately.He was getting into his clothes in fumbling haste."
10656,5,“All right.
10657,5,"But Ihaven't got the time now; I'm late as it is,” he returned, holding hisold silver turnip-watch to the candle.Zeena, apparently accepting this as final, lay watching him in silencewhile he pulled his suspenders over his shoulders and jerked his armsinto his coat; but as he went toward the door she said, suddenly andincisively: “I guess you're always late, now you shave every morning.”That thrust had frightened him more than any vague insinuations aboutDenis Eady."
10658,5,"It was a fact that since Mattie Silver's coming he had takento shaving every day; but his wife always seemed to be asleep when heleft her side in the winter darkness, and he had stupidly assumed thatshe would not notice any change in his appearance."
10659,5,"Once or twice in thepast he had been faintly disquieted by Zenobia's way of letting thingshappen without seeming to remark them, and then, weeks afterward, ina casual phrase, revealing that she had all along taken her notes anddrawn her inferences."
10660,5,"Of late, however, there had been no room in histhoughts for such vague apprehensions."
10661,5,"Zeena herself, from an oppressivereality, had faded into an insubstantial shade."
10662,5,"All his life was livedin the sight and sound of Mattie Silver, and he could no longer conceiveof its being otherwise."
10663,5,"But now, as he stood outside the church, and sawMattie spinning down the floor with Denis Eady, a throng of disregardedhints and menaces wove their cloud about his brain....IIAs the dancers poured out of the hall Frome, drawing back behind theprojecting storm-door, watched the segregation of the grotesquelymuffled groups, in which a moving lantern ray now and then lit up aface flushed with food and dancing."
10664,5,"The villagers, being afoot, werethe first to climb the slope to the main street, while the countryneighbours packed themselves more slowly into the sleighs under theshed.“Ain't you riding, Mattie?” a woman's voice called back from the throngabout the shed, and Ethan's heart gave a jump."
10665,5,"From where he stood hecould not see the persons coming out of the hall till they had advanceda few steps beyond the wooden sides of the storm-door; but through itscracks he heard a clear voice answer: “Mercy no! Not on such a night.”She was there, then, close to him, only a thin board between."
10666,5,"In anothermoment she would step forth into the night, and his eyes, accustomedto the obscurity, would discern her as clearly as though she stood indaylight."
10667,5,"A wave of shyness pulled him back into the dark angle of thewall, and he stood there in silence instead of making his presence knownto her."
10668,5,"It had been one of the wonders of their intercourse that fromthe first, she, the quicker, finer, more expressive, instead of crushinghim by the contrast, had given him something of her own ease andfreedom; but now he felt as heavy and loutish as in his student days,when he had tried to “jolly” the Worcester girls at a picnic.He hung back, and she came out alone and paused within a few yards ofhim."
10669,5,"She was almost the last to leave the hall, and she stood lookinguncertainly about her as if wondering why he did not show himself.Then a man's figure approached, coming so close to her that under theirformless wrappings they seemed merged in one dim outline.“Gentleman friend gone back on you? Say, Matt, that's tough! No, Iwouldn't be mean enough to tell the other girls."
10670,5,"I ain't as low-down asthat.” (How Frome hated his cheap banter!) “But look at here, ain't itlucky I got the old man's cutter down there waiting for us?”Frome heard the girl's voice, gaily incredulous: “What on earth's yourfather's cutter doin' down there?”“Why, waiting for me to take a ride."
10671,5,I got the roan colt too.
10672,5,"I kinderknew I'd want to take a ride to-night,” Eady, in his triumph, tried toput a sentimental note into his bragging voice.The girl seemed to waver, and Frome saw her twirl the end of her scarfirresolutely about her fingers."
10673,5,"Not for the world would he have madea sign to her, though it seemed to him that his life hung on her nextgesture.“Hold on a minute while I unhitch the colt,” Denis called to her,springing toward the shed.She stood perfectly still, looking after him, in an attitude of tranquilexpectancy torturing to the hidden watcher."
10674,5,"Frome noticed that she nolonger turned her head from side to side, as though peering through thenight for another figure."
10675,5,"She let Denis Eady lead out the horse, climbinto the cutter and fling back the bearskin to make room for her at hisside; then, with a swift motion of flight, she turned about and dartedup the slope toward the front of the church.“Good-bye! Hope you'll have a lovely ride!” she called back to him overher shoulder.Denis laughed, and gave the horse a cut that brought him quickly abreastof her retreating figure.“Come along! Get in quick! It's as slippery as thunder on this turn,” hecried, leaning over to reach out a hand to her.She laughed back at him: “Good-night! I'm not getting in.”By this time they had passed beyond Frome's earshot and he could onlyfollow the shadowy pantomime of their silhouettes as they continuedto move along the crest of the slope above him."
10676,5,"He saw Eady, after amoment, jump from the cutter and go toward the girl with the reins overone arm."
10677,5,"The other he tried to slip through hers; but she eluded himnimbly, and Frome's heart, which had swung out over a black void,trembled back to safety."
10678,5,"A moment later he heard the jingle of departingsleigh bells and discerned a figure advancing alone toward the emptyexpanse of snow before the church.In the black shade of the Varnum spruces he caught up with her and sheturned with a quick “Oh!”“Think I'd forgotten you, Matt?” he asked with sheepish glee.She answered seriously: “I thought maybe you couldn't come back for me.”“Couldn't? What on earth could stop me?”“I knew Zeena wasn't feeling any too good to-day.”“Oh, she's in bed long ago.” He paused, a question struggling in him.“Then you meant to walk home all alone?”“Oh, I ain't afraid!” she laughed.They stood together in the gloom of the spruces, an empty worldglimmering about them wide and grey under the stars."
10679,5,"He brought hisquestion out.“If you thought I hadn't come, why didn't you ride back with DenisEady?”“Why, where were you? How did you know? I never saw you!”Her wonder and his laughter ran together like spring rills in a thaw.Ethan had the sense of having done something arch and ingenious."
10680,5,"Toprolong the effect he groped for a dazzling phrase, and brought out, ina growl of rapture: “Come along.”He slipped an arm through hers, as Eady had done, and fancied it wasfaintly pressed against her side, but neither of them moved."
10681,5,It was sodark under the spruces that he could barely see the shape of her headbeside his shoulder.
10682,5,He longed to stoop his cheek and rub it againsther scarf.
10683,5,He would have liked to stand there with her all night in theblackness.
10684,5,She moved forward a step or two and then paused again abovethe dip of the Corbury road.
10685,5,"Its icy slope, scored by innumerablerunners, looked like a mirror scratched by travellers at an inn.“There was a whole lot of them coasting before the moon set,” she said.“Would you like to come in and coast with them some night?” he asked.“Oh, would you, Ethan? It would be lovely!”“We'll come to-morrow if there's a moon.”She lingered, pressing closer to his side."
10686,5,“Ned Hale and Ruth Varnumcame just as near running into the big elm at the bottom.
10687,5,We were allsure they were killed.” Her shiver ran down his arm.
10688,5,"“Wouldn't it havebeen too awful? They're so happy!”“Oh, Ned ain't much at steering."
10689,5,"I guess I can take you down all right!” he said disdainfully.He was aware that he was “talking big,” like Denis Eady; but hisreaction of joy had unsteadied him, and the inflection with which shehad said of the engaged couple “They're so happy!” made the words soundas if she had been thinking of herself and him.“The elm is dangerous, though."
10690,5,"It ought to be cut down,” she insisted.“Would you be afraid of it, with me?”“I told you I ain't the kind to be afraid” she tossed back, almostindifferently; and suddenly she began to walk on with a rapid step.These alterations of mood were the despair and joy of Ethan Frome."
10691,5,Themotions of her mind were as incalculable as the flit of a bird in thebranches.
10692,5,"The fact that he had no right to show his feelings, and thusprovoke the expression of hers, made him attach a fantastic importanceto every change in her look and tone."
10693,5,"Now he thought she understood him,and feared; now he was sure she did not, and despaired."
10694,5,"To-night thepressure of accumulated misgivings sent the scale drooping towarddespair, and her indifference was the more chilling after the flush ofjoy into which she had plunged him by dismissing Denis Eady."
10695,5,"He mountedSchool House Hill at her side and walked on in silence till theyreached the lane leading to the saw-mill; then the need of some definiteassurance grew too strong for him.“You'd have found me right off if you hadn't gone back to have that lastreel with Denis,” he brought out awkwardly."
10696,5,"He could not pronounce thename without a stiffening of the muscles of his throat.“Why, Ethan, how could I tell you were there?”“I suppose what folks say is true,” he jerked out at her, instead ofanswering.She stopped short, and he felt, in the darkness, that her face waslifted quickly to his."
10697,5,"“Why, what do folks say?”“It's natural enough you should be leaving us” he floundered on,following his thought.“Is that what they say?” she mocked back at him; then, with a suddendrop of her sweet treble: “You mean that Zeena--ain't suited with me anymore?” she faltered.Their arms had slipped apart and they stood motionless, each seeking todistinguish the other's face.“I know I ain't anything like as smart as I ought to be,” she went on,while he vainly struggled for expression."
10698,5,“There's lots of things ahired girl could do that come awkward to me still--and I haven't got muchstrength in my arms.
10699,5,But if she'd only tell me I'd try.
10700,5,"You know shehardly ever says anything, and sometimes I can see she ain't suited,and yet I don't know why.” She turned on him with a sudden flash ofindignation."
10701,5,"“You'd ought to tell me, Ethan Frome--you'd ought to! Unlessyou want me to go too--”Unless he wanted her to go too! The cry was balm to his raw wound."
10702,5,Theiron heavens seemed to melt and rain down sweetness.
10703,5,"Again he struggledfor the all-expressive word, and again, his arm in hers, found only adeep “Come along.”They walked on in silence through the blackness of the hemlock-shadedlane, where Ethan's sawmill gloomed through the night, and out againinto the comparative clearness of the fields."
10704,5,On the farther side of thehemlock belt the open country rolled away before them grey and lonelyunder the stars.
10705,5,Sometimes their way led them under the shade of anoverhanging bank or through the thin obscurity of a clump of leaflesstrees.
10706,5,"Here and there a farmhouse stood far back among the fields, muteand cold as a grave-stone."
10707,5,The night was so still that they heard thefrozen snow crackle under their feet.
10708,5,"The crash of a loaded branchfalling far off in the woods reverberated like a musket-shot, and once afox barked, and Mattie shrank closer to Ethan, and quickened her steps.At length they sighted the group of larches at Ethan's gate, and as theydrew near it the sense that the walk was over brought back his words.“Then you don't want to leave us, Matt?”He had to stoop his head to catch her stifled whisper: “Where'd I go, ifI did?”The answer sent a pang through him but the tone suffused him with joy.He forgot what else he had meant to say and pressed her against him soclosely that he seemed to feel her warmth in his veins.“You ain't crying are you, Matt?”“No, of course I'm not,” she quavered.They turned in at the gate and passed under the shaded knoll where,enclosed in a low fence, the Frome grave-stones slanted at crazy anglesthrough the snow."
10709,5,Ethan looked at them curiously.
10710,5,"For years that quietcompany had mocked his restlessness, his desire for change and freedom.“We never got away--how should you?” seemed to be written on everyheadstone; and whenever he went in or out of his gate he thought with ashiver: “I shall just go on living here till I join them.” But now alldesire for change had vanished, and the sight of the little enclosuregave him a warm sense of continuance and stability.“I guess we'll never let you go, Matt,” he whispered, as though even thedead, lovers once, must conspire with him to keep her; and brushing bythe graves, he thought: “We'll always go on living here together, andsome day she'll lie there beside me.”He let the vision possess him as they climbed the hill to the house.He was never so happy with her as when he abandoned himself to thesedreams."
10711,5,Half-way up the slope Mattie stumbled against some unseenobstruction and clutched his sleeve to steady herself.
10712,5,"The wave ofwarmth that went through him was like the prolongation of his vision.For the first time he stole his arm about her, and she did not resist.They walked on as if they were floating on a summer stream.Zeena always went to bed as soon as she had had her supper, and theshutterless windows of the house were dark."
10713,5,"A dead cucumber-vine dangledfrom the porch like the crape streamer tied to the door for a death, andthe thought flashed through Ethan's brain: “If it was there for Zeena--” Then he had a distinct sight of his wife lying in their bedroom asleep,her mouth slightly open, her false teeth in a tumbler by the bed...They walked around to the back of the house, between the rigidgooseberry bushes."
10714,5,"It was Zeena's habit, when they came back late fromthe village, to leave the key of the kitchen door under the mat."
10715,5,"Ethanstood before the door, his head heavy with dreams, his arm still aboutMattie."
10716,5,"“Matt--” he began, not knowing what he meant to say.She slipped out of his hold without speaking, and he stooped down andfelt for the key.“It's not there!” he said, straightening himself with a start.They strained their eyes at each other through the icy darkness."
10717,5,"Such athing had never happened before.“Maybe she's forgotten it,” Mattie said in a tremulous whisper; but bothof them knew that it was not like Zeena to forget.“It might have fallen off into the snow,” Mattie continued, after apause during which they had stood intently listening.“It must have been pushed off, then,” he rejoined in the same tone.Another wild thought tore through him."
10718,5,"What if tramps had beenthere--what if...Again he listened, fancying he heard a distant sound in the house; thenhe felt in his pocket for a match, and kneeling down, passed its lightslowly over the rough edges of snow about the doorstep.He was still kneeling when his eyes, on a level with the lower panel ofthe door, caught a faint ray beneath it."
10719,5,"Who could be stirring in thatsilent house? He heard a step on the stairs, and again for an instantthe thought of tramps tore through him."
10720,5,"Then the door opened and he sawhis wife.Against the dark background of the kitchen she stood up tall andangular, one hand drawing a quilted counterpane to her flat breast,while the other held a lamp."
10721,5,"The light, on a level with her chin, drewout of the darkness her puckered throat and the projecting wrist of thehand that clutched the quilt, and deepened fantastically the hollows andprominences of her high-boned face under its ring of crimping-pins."
10722,5,"ToEthan, still in the rosy haze of his hour with Mattie, the sight camewith the intense precision of the last dream before waking."
10723,5,"He felt asif he had never before known what his wife looked like.She drew aside without speaking, and Mattie and Ethan passed into thekitchen, which had the deadly chill of a vault after the dry cold of thenight.“Guess you forgot about us, Zeena,” Ethan joked, stamping the snow fromhis boots.“No."
10724,5,"I just felt so mean I couldn't sleep.”Mattie came forward, unwinding her wraps, the colour of the cherry scarfin her fresh lips and cheeks."
10725,5,"“I'm so sorry, Zeena! Isn't there anythingI can do?”“No; there's nothing.” Zeena turned away from her."
10726,5,"“You might 'a' shookoff that snow outside,” she said to her husband.She walked out of the kitchen ahead of them and pausing in the hallraised the lamp at arm's-length, as if to light them up the stairs.Ethan paused also, affecting to fumble for the peg on which he hung hiscoat and cap."
10727,5,"The doors of the two bedrooms faced each other across thenarrow upper landing, and to-night it was peculiarly repugnant to himthat Mattie should see him follow Zeena.“I guess I won't come up yet awhile,” he said, turning as if to go backto the kitchen.Zeena stopped short and looked at him."
10728,5,"“For the land's sake--what yougoing to do down here?”“I've got the mill accounts to go over.”She continued to stare at him, the flame of the unshaded lamp bringingout with microscopic cruelty the fretful lines of her face.“At this time o' night? You'll ketch your death."
10729,5,The fire's out longago.”Without answering he moved away toward the kitchen.
10730,5,As he did so hisglance crossed Mattie's and he fancied that a fugitive warning gleamedthrough her lashes.
10731,5,The next moment they sank to her flushed cheeks andshe began to mount the stairs ahead of Zeena.“That's so.
10732,5,"It is powerful cold down here,” Ethan assented; and withlowered head he went up in his wife's wake, and followed her across thethreshold of their room.IIIThere was some hauling to be done at the lower end of the wood-lot, andEthan was out early the next day.The winter morning was as clear as crystal."
10733,5,"The sunrise burned red in apure sky, the shadows on the rim of the wood-lot were darkly blue, andbeyond the white and scintillating fields patches of far-off forest hunglike smoke.It was in the early morning stillness, when his muscles were swingingto their familiar task and his lungs expanding with long draughts ofmountain air, that Ethan did his clearest thinking."
10734,5,He and Zeena had notexchanged a word after the door of their room had closed on them.
10735,5,"Shehad measured out some drops from a medicine-bottle on a chair by the bedand, after swallowing them, and wrapping her head in a piece of yellowflannel, had lain down with her face turned away."
10736,5,Ethan undressedhurriedly and blew out the light so that he should not see her when hetook his place at her side.
10737,5,"As he lay there he could hear Mattie movingabout in her room, and her candle, sending its small ray across thelanding, drew a scarcely perceptible line of light under his door."
10738,5,Hekept his eyes fixed on the light till it vanished.
10739,5,"Then the room grewperfectly black, and not a sound was audible but Zeena's asthmaticbreathing."
10740,5,"Ethan felt confusedly that there were many things he oughtto think about, but through his tingling veins and tired brain only onesensation throbbed: the warmth of Mattie's shoulder against his."
10741,5,Why hadhe not kissed her when he held her there? A few hours earlier he wouldnot have asked himself the question.
10742,5,"Even a few minutes earlier, whenthey had stood alone outside the house, he would not have dared to thinkof kissing her."
10743,5,"But since he had seen her lips in the lamplight he feltthat they were his.Now, in the bright morning air, her face was still before him."
10744,5,It waspart of the sun's red and of the pure glitter on the snow.
10745,5,How thegirl had changed since she had come to Starkfield! He remembered what acolourless slip of a thing she had looked the day he had met her at thestation.
10746,5,"And all the first winter, how she had shivered with cold whenthe northerly gales shook the thin clapboards and the snow beat likehail against the loose-hung windows!He had been afraid that she would hate the hard life, the cold andloneliness; but not a sign of discontent escaped her."
10747,5,Zeena took theview that Mattie was bound to make the best of Starkfield since shehadn't any other place to go to; but this did not strike Ethan asconclusive.
10748,5,"Zeena, at any rate, did not apply the principle in her owncase.He felt all the more sorry for the girl because misfortune had, ina sense, indentured her to them."
10749,5,"Mattie Silver was the daughter ofa cousin of Zenobia Frome's, who had inflamed his clan with mingledsentiments of envy and admiration by descending from the hills toConnecticut, where he had married a Stamford girl and succeeded toher father's thriving “drug” business."
10750,5,"Unhappily Orin Silver, a man offar-reaching aims, had died too soon to prove that the end justifies themeans."
10751,5,His accounts revealed merely what the means had been; and thesewere such that it was fortunate for his wife and daughter that his bookswere examined only after his impressive funeral.
10752,5,"His wife died of thedisclosure, and Mattie, at twenty, was left alone to make her way on thefifty dollars obtained from the sale of her piano."
10753,5,"For this purpose herequipment, though varied, was inadequate."
10754,5,"She could trim a hat, makemolasses candy, recite “Curfew shall not ring to-night,” and play “TheLost Chord” and a pot-pourri from “Carmen.” When she tried to extend thefield of her activities in the direction of stenography and book-keepingher health broke down, and six months on her feet behind the counter ofa department store did not tend to restore it."
10755,5,"Her nearest relations hadbeen induced to place their savings in her father's hands, and though,after his death, they ungrudgingly acquitted themselves of the Christianduty of returning good for evil by giving his daughter all the adviceat their disposal, they could hardly be expected to supplement it bymaterial aid."
10756,5,But when Zenobia's doctor recommended her looking aboutfor some one to help her with the house-work the clan instantly saw thechance of exacting a compensation from Mattie.
10757,5,"Zenobia, though doubtfulof the girl's efficiency, was tempted by the freedom to find faultwithout much risk of losing her; and so Mattie came to Starkfield.Zenobia's fault-finding was of the silent kind, but not the lesspenetrating for that."
10758,5,During the first months Ethan alternately burnedwith the desire to see Mattie defy her and trembled with fear of theresult.
10759,5,Then the situation grew less strained.
10760,5,"The pure air, and thelong summer hours in the open, gave back life and elasticity to Mattie,and Zeena, with more leisure to devote to her complex ailments, grewless watchful of the girl's omissions; so that Ethan, struggling onunder the burden of his barren farm and failing saw-mill, could at leastimagine that peace reigned in his house.There was really, even now, no tangible evidence to the contrary; butsince the previous night a vague dread had hung on his sky-line."
10761,5,"It wasformed of Zeena's obstinate silence, of Mattie's sudden look of warning,of the memory of just such fleeting imperceptible signs as those whichtold him, on certain stainless mornings, that before night there wouldbe rain.His dread was so strong that, man-like, he sought to postpone certainty.The hauling was not over till mid-day, and as the lumber was to bedelivered to Andrew Hale, the Starkfield builder, it was really easierfor Ethan to send Jotham Powell, the hired man, back to the farm onfoot, and drive the load down to the village himself."
10762,5,"He had scrambledup on the logs, and was sitting astride of them, close over his shaggygrays, when, coming between him and their streaming necks, he had avision of the warning look that Mattie had given him the night before.“If there's going to be any trouble I want to be there,” was his vaguereflection, as he threw to Jotham the unexpected order to unhitch theteam and lead them back to the barn.It was a slow trudge home through the heavy fields, and when the twomen entered the kitchen Mattie was lifting the coffee from the stove andZeena was already at the table."
10763,5,Her husband stopped short at sight ofher.
10764,5,"Instead of her usual calico wrapper and knitted shawl she wore herbest dress of brown merino, and above her thin strands of hair, whichstill preserved the tight undulations of the crimping-pins, rose a hardperpendicular bonnet, as to which Ethan's clearest notion was that hehad to pay five dollars for it at the Bettsbridge Emporium."
10765,5,"On the floorbeside her stood his old valise and a bandbox wrapped in newspapers.“Why, where are you going, Zeena?” he exclaimed.“I've got my shooting pains so bad that I'm going over to Bettsbridgeto spend the night with Aunt Martha Pierce and see that new doctor,” sheanswered in a matter-of-fact tone, as if she had said she was going intothe store-room to take a look at the preserves, or up to the attic to goover the blankets.In spite of her sedentary habits such abrupt decisions were not withoutprecedent in Zeena's history."
10766,5,"Twice or thrice before she had suddenlypacked Ethan's valise and started off to Bettsbridge, or evenSpringfield, to seek the advice of some new doctor, and her husband hadgrown to dread these expeditions because of their cost."
10767,5,"Zeena alwayscame back laden with expensive remedies, and her last visit toSpringfield had been commemorated by her paying twenty dollars for anelectric battery of which she had never been able to learn the use."
10768,5,Butfor the moment his sense of relief was so great as to preclude all otherfeelings.
10769,5,"He had now no doubt that Zeena had spoken the truth in saying,the night before, that she had sat up because she felt “too mean” tosleep: her abrupt resolve to seek medical advice showed that, as usual,she was wholly absorbed in her health.As if expecting a protest, she continued plaintively; “If you're toobusy with the hauling I presume you can let Jotham Powell drive me overwith the sorrel in time to ketch the train at the Flats.”Her husband hardly heard what she was saying."
10770,5,"During the winter monthsthere was no stage between Starkfield and Bettsbridge, and the trainswhich stopped at Corbury Flats were slow and infrequent."
10771,5,"A rapidcalculation showed Ethan that Zeena could not be back at the farm beforethe following evening....“If I'd supposed you'd 'a' made any objection to Jotham Powell's drivingme over--” she began again, as though his silence had implied refusal."
10772,5,Onthe brink of departure she was always seized with a flux of words.
10773,5,"“AllI know is,” she continued, “I can't go on the way I am much longer.The pains are clear away down to my ankles now, or I'd 'a' walked in toStarkfield on my own feet, sooner'n put you out, and asked Michael Eadyto let me ride over on his wagon to the Flats, when he sends to meet thetrain that brings his groceries."
10774,5,"I'd 'a' had two hours to wait in thestation, but I'd sooner 'a' done it, even with this cold, than to haveyou say--”“Of course Jotham'll drive you over,” Ethan roused himself to answer.He became suddenly conscious that he was looking at Mattie while Zeenatalked to him, and with an effort he turned his eyes to his wife."
10775,5,"Shesat opposite the window, and the pale light reflected from the banks ofsnow made her face look more than usually drawn and bloodless, sharpenedthe three parallel creases between ear and cheek, and drew querulouslines from her thin nose to the corners of her mouth."
10776,5,"Though she was butseven years her husband's senior, and he was only twenty-eight, she wasalready an old woman.Ethan tried to say something befitting the occasion, but there was onlyone thought in his mind: the fact that, for the first time sinceMattie had come to live with them, Zeena was to be away for a night."
10777,5,"Hewondered if the girl were thinking of it too....He knew that Zeena must be wondering why he did not offer to drive herto the Flats and let Jotham Powell take the lumber to Starkfield, andat first he could not think of a pretext for not doing so; then he said:“I'd take you over myself, only I've got to collect the cash for thelumber.”As soon as the words were spoken he regretted them, not only becausethey were untrue--there being no prospect of his receiving cash paymentfrom Hale--but also because he knew from experience the imprudence ofletting Zeena think he was in funds on the eve of one of her therapeuticexcursions."
10778,5,"At the moment, however, his one desire was to avoid the longdrive with her behind the ancient sorrel who never went out of a walk.Zeena made no reply: she did not seem to hear what he had said."
10779,5,"She hadalready pushed her plate aside, and was measuring out a draught from alarge bottle at her elbow.“It ain't done me a speck of good, but I guess I might as well use itup,” she remarked; adding, as she pushed the empty bottle toward Mattie:“If you can get the taste out it'll do for pickles.”IVAs soon as his wife had driven off Ethan took his coat and cap from thepeg."
10780,5,"Mattie was washing up the dishes, humming one of the dance tunesof the night before."
10781,5,"He said “So long, Matt,” and she answered gaily “Solong, Ethan”; and that was all.It was warm and bright in the kitchen."
10782,5,"The sun slanted through the southwindow on the girl's moving figure, on the cat dozing in a chair, and onthe geraniums brought in from the door-way, where Ethan had plantedthem in the summer to “make a garden” for Mattie."
10783,5,"He would have liked tolinger on, watching her tidy up and then settle down to her sewing; buthe wanted still more to get the hauling done and be back at the farmbefore night.All the way down to the village he continued to think of his return toMattie."
10784,5,"The kitchen was a poor place, not “spruce” and shining as hismother had kept it in his boyhood; but it was surprising what a homelikelook the mere fact of Zeena's absence gave it."
10785,5,"And he pictured what itwould be like that evening, when he and Mattie were there after supper.For the first time they would be alone together indoors, and they wouldsit there, one on each side of the stove, like a married couple, he inhis stocking feet and smoking his pipe, she laughing and talking in thatfunny way she had, which was always as new to him as if he had neverheard her before.The sweetness of the picture, and the relief of knowing that his fearsof “trouble” with Zeena were unfounded, sent up his spirits with a rush,and he, who was usually so silent, whistled and sang aloud as hedrove through the snowy fields."
10786,5,"There was in him a slumbering spark ofsociability which the long Starkfield winters had not yet extinguished.By nature grave and inarticulate, he admired recklessness and gaiety inothers and was warmed to the marrow by friendly human intercourse."
10787,5,"AtWorcester, though he had the name of keeping to himself and not beingmuch of a hand at a good time, he had secretly gloried in being clappedon the back and hailed as “Old Ethe” or “Old Stiff”; and the cessationof such familiarities had increased the chill of his return toStarkfield.There the silence had deepened about him year by year."
10788,5,"Left alone, afterhis father's accident, to carry the burden of farm and mill, he had hadno time for convivial loiterings in the village; and when his motherfell ill the loneliness of the house grew more oppressive than thatof the fields."
10789,5,"His mother had been a talker in her day, but after her“trouble” the sound of her voice was seldom heard, though she had notlost the power of speech."
10790,5,"Sometimes, in the long winter evenings, whenin desperation her son asked her why she didn't “say something,” shewould lift a finger and answer: “Because I'm listening”; and on stormynights, when the loud wind was about the house, she would complain, ifhe spoke to her: “They're talking so out there that I can't hear you.”It was only when she drew toward her last illness, and his cousinZenobia Pierce came over from the next valley to help him nurse her,that human speech was heard again in the house."
10791,5,After the mortal silenceof his long imprisonment Zeena's volubility was music in his ears.
10792,5,Hefelt that he might have “gone like his mother” if the sound of a newvoice had not come to steady him.
10793,5,Zeena seemed to understand his caseat a glance.
10794,5,She laughed at him for not knowing the simplest sick-bedduties and told him to “go right along out” and leave her to see tothings.
10795,5,"The mere fact of obeying her orders, of feeling free to go abouthis business again and talk with other men, restored his shaken balanceand magnified his sense of what he owed her."
10796,5,Her efficiency shamed anddazzled him.
10797,5,She seemed to possess by instinct all the household wisdomthat his long apprenticeship had not instilled in him.
10798,5,"When the end cameit was she who had to tell him to hitch up and go for the undertaker,and she thought it “funny” that he had not settled beforehand who wasto have his mother's clothes and the sewing-machine."
10799,5,"After the funeral,when he saw her preparing to go away, he was seized with an unreasoningdread of being left alone on the farm; and before he knew what he wasdoing he had asked her to stay there with him."
10800,5,"He had often thoughtsince that it would not have happened if his mother had died in springinstead of winter...When they married it was agreed that, as soon as he could straighten outthe difficulties resulting from Mrs."
10801,5,"Frome's long illness, they wouldsell the farm and saw-mill and try their luck in a large town."
10802,5,Ethan'slove of nature did not take the form of a taste for agriculture.
10803,5,"He hadalways wanted to be an engineer, and to live in towns, where therewere lectures and big libraries and “fellows doing things.” A slightengineering job in Florida, put in his way during his period of study atWorcester, increased his faith in his ability as well as his eagernessto see the world; and he felt sure that, with a “smart” wife like Zeena,it would not be long before he had made himself a place in it.Zeena's native village was slightly larger and nearer to the railwaythan Starkfield, and she had let her husband see from the first thatlife on an isolated farm was not what she had expected when she married.But purchasers were slow in coming, and while he waited for them Ethanlearned the impossibility of transplanting her."
10804,5,"She chose to look downon Starkfield, but she could not have lived in a place which lookeddown on her."
10805,5,"Even Bettsbridge or Shadd's Falls would not have beensufficiently aware of her, and in the greater cities which attractedEthan she would have suffered a complete loss of identity."
10806,5,"And withina year of their marriage she developed the “sickliness” which had sincemade her notable even in a community rich in pathological instances.When she came to take care of his mother she had seemed to Ethan likethe very genius of health, but he soon saw that her skill as a nurse hadbeen acquired by the absorbed observation of her own symptoms.Then she too fell silent."
10807,5,"Perhaps it was the inevitable effect of lifeon the farm, or perhaps, as she sometimes said, it was because Ethan“never listened.” The charge was not wholly unfounded."
10808,5,"When she spokeit was only to complain, and to complain of things not in his power toreme."
10809,5,"On a January evening of the early seventies, Christine Nilsson wassinging in Faust at the Academy of Music in New York.Though there was already talk of the erection, in remote metropolitandistances ""above the Forties,"" of a new Opera House which shouldcompete in costliness and splendour with those of the great Europeancapitals, the world of fashion was still content to reassemble everywinter in the shabby red and gold boxes of the sociable old Academy.Conservatives cherished it for being small and inconvenient, and thuskeeping out the ""new people"" whom New York was beginning to dread andyet be drawn to; and the sentimental clung to it for its historicassociations, and the musical for its excellent acoustics, always soproblematic a quality in halls built for the hearing of music.It was Madame Nilsson's first appearance that winter, and what thedaily press had already learned to describe as ""an exceptionallybrilliant audience"" had gathered to hear her, transported through theslippery, snowy streets in private broughams, in the spacious familylandau, or in the humbler but more convenient ""Brown coupe."" To come tothe Opera in a Brown coupe was almost as honourable a way of arrivingas in one's own carriage; and departure by the same means had theimmense advantage of enabling one (with a playful allusion todemocratic principles) to scramble into the first Brown conveyance inthe line, instead of waiting till the cold-and-gin congested nose ofone's own coachman gleamed under the portico of the Academy."
10810,5, It wasone of the great livery-stableman's most masterly intuitions to havediscovered that Americans want to get away from amusement even morequickly than they want to get to it.When Newland Archer opened the door at the back of the club box thecurtain had just gone up on the garden scene.
10811,5," There was no reason whythe young man should not have come earlier, for he had dined at seven,alone with his mother and sister, and had lingered afterward over acigar in the Gothic library with glazed black-walnut bookcases andfinial-topped chairs which was the only room in the house where Mrs.Archer allowed smoking."
10812,5," But, in the first place, New York was ametropolis, and perfectly aware that in metropolises it was ""not thething"" to arrive early at the opera; and what was or was not ""thething"" played a part as important in Newland Archer's New York as theinscrutable totem terrors that had ruled the destinies of hisforefathers thousands of years ago.The second reason for his delay was a personal one."
10813,5," He had dawdledover his cigar because he was at heart a dilettante, and thinking overa pleasure to come often gave him a subtler satisfaction than itsrealisation."
10814,5," This was especially the case when the pleasure was adelicate one, as his pleasures mostly were; and on this occasion themoment he looked forward to was so rare and exquisite in qualitythat--well, if he had timed his arrival in accord with the primadonna's stage-manager he could not have entered the Academy at a moresignificant moment than just as she was singing:  ""He loves me--heloves me not--HE LOVES ME!--"" and sprinkling the falling daisy petalswith notes as clear as dew.She sang, of course, ""M'ama!"" and not ""he loves me,"" since anunalterable and unquestioned law of the musical world required that theGerman text of French operas sung by Swedish artists should betranslated into Italian for the clearer understanding ofEnglish-speaking audiences."
10815,5," This seemed as natural to Newland Archeras all the other conventions on which his life was moulded: such as theduty of using two silver-backed brushes with his monogram in blueenamel to part his hair, and of never appearing in society without aflower (preferably a gardenia) in his buttonhole.""M'ama ..."
10816,5,"non m'ama ..."" the prima donna sang, and ""M'ama!"", with afinal burst of love triumphant, as she pressed the dishevelled daisy toher lips and lifted her large eyes to the sophisticated countenance ofthe little brown Faust-Capoul, who was vainly trying, in a tight purplevelvet doublet and plumed cap, to look as pure and true as his artlessvictim.Newland Archer, leaning against the wall at the back of the club box,turned his eyes from the stage and scanned the opposite side of thehouse."
10817,5, Directly facing him was the box of old Mrs.
10818,5,"Manson Mingott,whose monstrous obesity had long since made it impossible for her toattend the Opera, but who was always represented on fashionable nightsby some of the younger members of the family."
10819,5," On this occasion, thefront of the box was filled by her daughter-in-law, Mrs."
10820,5,"LovellMingott, and her daughter, Mrs."
10821,5,Welland; and slightly withdrawn behindthese brocaded matrons sat a young girl in white with eyes ecstaticallyfixed on the stagelovers.
10822,5," As Madame Nilsson's ""M'ama!"" thrilled outabove the silent house (the boxes always stopped talking during theDaisy Song) a warm pink mounted to the girl's cheek, mantled her browto the roots of her fair braids, and suffused the young slope of herbreast to the line where it met a modest tulle tucker fastened with asingle gardenia."
10823,5," She dropped her eyes to the immense bouquet oflilies-of-the-valley on her knee, and Newland Archer saw herwhite-gloved finger-tips touch the flowers softly."
10824,5," He drew a breath ofsatisfied vanity and his eyes returned to the stage.No expense had been spared on the setting, which was acknowledged to bevery beautiful even by people who shared his acquaintance with theOpera houses of Paris and Vienna."
10825,5," The foreground, to the footlights,was covered with emerald green cloth."
10826,5, In the middle distancesymmetrical mounds of woolly green moss bounded by croquet hoops formedthe base of shrubs shaped like orange-trees but studded with large pinkand red roses.
10827,5," Gigantic pansies, considerably larger than the roses,and closely resembling the floral pen-wipers made by femaleparishioners for fashionable clergymen, sprang from the moss beneaththe rose-trees; and here and there a daisy grafted on a rose-branchflowered with a luxuriance prophetic of Mr."
10828,5,"Luther Burbank's far-offprodigies.In the centre of this enchanted garden Madame Nilsson, in whitecashmere slashed with pale blue satin, a reticule dangling from a bluegirdle, and large yellow braids carefully disposed on each side of hermuslin chemisette, listened with downcast eyes to M."
10829,5,"Capoul'simpassioned wooing, and affected a guileless incomprehension of hisdesigns whenever, by word or glance, he persuasively indicated theground floor window of the neat brick villa projecting obliquely fromthe right wing.""The darling!"" thought Newland Archer, his glance flitting back to theyoung girl with the lilies-of-the-valley."
10830,5," ""She doesn't even guess whatit's all about."" And he contemplated her absorbed young face with athrill of possessorship in which pride in his own masculine initiationwas mingled with a tender reverence for her abysmal purity."
10831,5," ""We'llread Faust together ..."
10832,5,"by the Italian lakes ..."" he thought, somewhathazily confusing the scene of his projected honey-moon with themasterpieces of literature which it would be his manly privilege toreveal to his bride."
10833,5," It was only that afternoon that May Welland hadlet him guess that she ""cared"" (New York's consecrated phrase of maidenavowal), and already his imagination, leaping ahead of the engagementring, the betrothal kiss and the march from Lohengrin, pictured her athis side in some scene of old European witchery.He did not in the least wish the future Mrs."
10834,5,Newland Archer to be asimpleton.
10835,5," He meant her (thanks to his enlightening companionship) todevelop a social tact and readiness of wit enabling her to hold her ownwith the most popular married women of the ""younger set,"" in which itwas the recognised custom to attract masculine homage while playfullydiscouraging it."
10836,5," If he had probed to the bottom of his vanity (as hesometimes nearly did) he would have found there the wish that his wifeshould be as worldly-wise and as eager to please as the married ladywhose charms had held his fancy through two mildly agitated years;without, of course, any hint of the frailty which had so nearly marredthat unhappy being's life, and had disarranged his own plans for awhole winter.How this miracle of fire and ice was to be created, and to sustainitself in a harsh world, he had never taken the time to think out; buthe was content to hold his view without analysing it, since he knew itwas that of all the carefully-brushed, white-waistcoated,button-hole-flowered gentlemen who succeeded each other in the clubbox, exchanged friendly greetings with him, and turned theiropera-glasses critically on the circle of ladies who were the productof the system."
10837,5," In matters intellectual and artistic Newland Archerfelt himself distinctly the superior of these chosen specimens of oldNew York gentility; he had probably read more, thought more, and evenseen a good deal more of the world, than any other man of the number.Singly they betrayed their inferiority; but grouped together theyrepresented ""New York,"" and the habit of masculine solidarity made himaccept their doctrine on all the issues called moral."
10838,5," He instinctivelyfelt that in this respect it would be troublesome--and also rather badform--to strike out for himself.""Well--upon my soul!"" exclaimed Lawrence Lefferts, turning hisopera-glass abruptly away from the stage."
10839,5," Lawrence Lefferts was, onthe whole, the foremost authority on ""form"" in New York."
10840,5, He hadprobably devoted more time than any one else to the study of thisintricate and fascinating question; but study alone could not accountfor his complete and easy competence.
10841,5," One had only to look at him,from the slant of his bald forehead and the curve of his beautiful fairmoustache to the long patent-leather feet at the other end of his leanand elegant person, to feel that the knowledge of ""form"" must becongenital in any one who knew how to wear such good clothes socarelessly and carry such height with so much lounging grace."
10842,5," As ayoung admirer had once said of him:  ""If anybody can tell a fellow justwhen to wear a black tie with evening clothes and when not to, it'sLarry Lefferts.""  And on the question of pumps versus patent-leather""Oxfords"" his authority had never been disputed.""My God!"" he said; and silently handed his glass to old SillertonJackson.Newland Archer, following Lefferts's glance, saw with surprise that hisexclamation had been occasioned by the entry of a new figure into oldMrs."
10843,5,Mingott's box.
10844,5," It was that of a slim young woman, a little lesstall than May Welland, with brown hair growing in close curls about hertemples and held in place by a narrow band of diamonds."
10845,5," The suggestionof this headdress, which gave her what was then called a ""Josephinelook,"" was carried out in the cut of the dark blue velvet gown rathertheatrically caught up under her bosom by a girdle with a largeold-fashioned clasp."
10846,5," The wearer of this unusual dress, who seemedquite unconscious of the attention it was attracting, stood a moment inthe centre of the box, discussing with Mrs."
10847,5,"Welland the propriety oftaking the latter's place in the front right-hand corner; then sheyielded with a slight smile, and seated herself in line with Mrs.Welland's sister-in-law, Mrs."
10848,5,"Lovell Mingott, who was installed in theopposite corner.Mr."
10849,5,Sillerton Jackson had returned the opera-glass to LawrenceLefferts.
10850,5," The whole of the club turned instinctively, waiting to hearwhat the old man had to say; for old Mr."
10851,5,"Jackson was as great anauthority on ""family"" as Lawrence Lefferts was on ""form.""  He knew allthe ramifications of New York's cousinships; and could not onlyelucidate such complicated questions as that of the connection betweenthe Mingotts (through the Thorleys) with the Dallases of SouthCarolina, and that of the relationship of the elder branch ofPhiladelphia Thorleys to the Albany Chiverses (on no account to beconfused with the Manson Chiverses of University Place), but could alsoenumerate the leading characteristics of each family: as, for instance,the fabulous stinginess of the younger lines of Leffertses (the LongIsland ones); or the fatal tendency of the Rushworths to make foolishmatches; or the insanity recurring in every second generation of theAlbany Chiverses, with whom their New York cousins had always refusedto intermarry--with the disastrous exception of poor Medora Manson,who, as everybody knew ..."
10852,5,"but then her mother was a Rushworth.In addition to this forest of family trees, Mr."
10853,5,"Sillerton Jacksoncarried between his narrow hollow temples, and under his soft thatch ofsilver hair, a register of most of the scandals and mysteries that hadsmouldered under the unruffled surface of New York society within thelast fifty years."
10854,5," So far indeed did his information extend, and soacutely retentive was his memory, that he was supposed to be the onlyman who could have told you who Julius Beaufort, the banker, reallywas, and what had become of handsome Bob Spicer, old Mrs."
10855,5,"MansonMingott's father, who had disappeared so mysteriously (with a large sumof trust money) less than a year after his marriage, on the very daythat a beautiful Spanish dancer who had been delighting throngedaudiences in the old Opera-house on the Battery had taken ship forCuba."
10856,5," But these mysteries, and many others, were closely locked in Mr.Jackson's breast; for not only did his keen sense of honour forbid hisrepeating anything privately imparted, but he was fully aware that hisreputation for discretion increased his opportunities of finding outwhat he wanted to know.The club box, therefore, waited in visible suspense while Mr."
10857,5,SillertonJackson handed back Lawrence Lefferts's opera-glass.
10858,5," For a moment hesilently scrutinised the attentive group out of his filmy blue eyesoverhung by old veined lids; then he gave his moustache a thoughtfultwist, and said simply:  ""I didn't think the Mingotts would have triedit on.""II.Newland Archer, during this brief episode, had been thrown into astrange state of embarrassment.It was annoying that the box which was thus attracting the undividedattention of masculine New York should be that in which his betrothedwas seated between her mother and aunt; and for a moment he could notidentify the lady in the Empire dress, nor imagine why her presencecreated such excitement among the initiated."
10859,5," Then light dawned on him,and with it came a momentary rush of indignation."
10860,5," No, indeed; no onewould have thought the Mingotts would have tried it on!But they had; they undoubtedly had; for the low-toned comments behindhim left no doubt in Archer's mind that the young woman was MayWelland's cousin, the cousin always referred to in the family as ""poorEllen Olenska.""  Archer knew that she had suddenly arrived from Europea day or two previously; he had even heard from Miss Welland (notdisapprovingly) that she had been to see poor Ellen, who was stayingwith old Mrs."
10861,5,Mingott.
10862,5," Archer entirely approved of family solidarity,and one of the qualities he most admired in the Mingotts was theirresolute championship of the few black sheep that their blameless stockhad produced."
10863,5," There was nothing mean or ungenerous in the young man'sheart, and he was glad that his future wife should not be restrained byfalse prudery from being kind (in private) to her unhappy cousin; butto receive Countess Olenska in the family circle was a different thingfrom producing her in public, at the Opera of all places, and in thevery box with the young girl whose engagement to him, Newland Archer,was to be announced within a few weeks."
10864,5," No, he felt as old SillertonJackson felt; he did not think the Mingotts would have tried it on!He knew, of course, that whatever man dared (within Fifth Avenue'slimits) that old Mrs."
10865,5,"Manson Mingott, the Matriarch of the line, woulddare."
10866,5," He had always admired the high and mighty old lady, who, inspite of having been only Catherine Spicer of Staten Island, with afather mysteriously discredited, and neither money nor position enoughto make people forget it, had allied herself with the head of thewealthy Mingott line, married two of her daughters to ""foreigners"" (anItalian marquis and an English banker), and put the crowning touch toher audacities by building a large house of pale cream-coloured stone(when brown sandstone seemed as much the only wear as a frock-coat inthe afternoon) in an inaccessible wilderness near the Central Park.Old Mrs."
10867,5,Mingott's foreign daughters had become a legend.
10868,5," They nevercame back to see their mother, and the latter being, like many personsof active mind and dominating will, sedentary and corpulent in herhabit, had philosophically remained at home."
10869,5," But the cream-colouredhouse (supposed to be modelled on the private hotels of the Parisianaristocracy) was there as a visible proof of her moral courage; and shethroned in it, among pre-Revolutionary furniture and souvenirs of theTuileries of Louis Napoleon (where she had shone in her middle age), asplacidly as if there were nothing peculiar in living aboveThirty-fourth Street, or in having French windows that opened likedoors instead of sashes that pushed up.Every one (including Mr."
10870,5,"Sillerton Jackson) was agreed that oldCatherine had never had beauty--a gift which, in the eyes of New York,justified every success, and excused a certain number of failings.Unkind people said that, like her Imperial namesake, she had won herway to success by strength of will and hardness of heart, and a kind ofhaughty effrontery that was somehow justified by the extreme decencyand dignity of her private life."
10871,5, Mr.
10872,5,"Manson Mingott had died when shewas only twenty-eight, and had ""tied up"" the money with an additionalcaution born of the general distrust of the Spicers; but his bold youngwidow went her way fearlessly, mingled freely in foreign society,married her daughters in heaven knew what corrupt and fashionablecircles, hobnobbed with Dukes and Ambassadors, associated familiarlywith Papists, entertained Opera singers, and was the intimate friend ofMme."
10873,5,"Taglioni; and all the while (as Sillerton Jackson was the first toproclaim) there had never been a breath on her reputation; the onlyrespect, he always added, in which she differed from the earlierCatherine.Mrs."
10874,5,"Manson Mingott had long since succeeded in untying her husband'sfortune, and had lived in affluence for half a century; but memories ofher early straits had made her excessively thrifty, and though, whenshe bought a dress or a piece of furniture, she took care that itshould be of the best, she could not bring herself to spend much on thetransient pleasures of the table."
10875,5," Therefore, for totally differentreasons, her food was as poor as Mrs."
10876,5,"Archer's, and her wines didnothing to redeem it."
10877,5," Her relatives considered that the penury of hertable discredited the Mingott name, which had always been associatedwith good living; but people continued to come to her in spite of the""made dishes"" and flat champagne, and in reply to the remonstrances ofher son Lovell (who tried to retrieve the family credit by having thebest chef in New York) she used to say laughingly:  ""What's the use oftwo good cooks in one family, now that I've married the girls and can'teat sauces?""Newland Archer, as he mused on these things, had once more turned hiseyes toward the Mingott box."
10878,5, He saw that Mrs.
10879,5,"Welland and hersister-in-law were facing their semicircle of critics with theMingottian APLOMB which old Catherine had inculcated in all her tribe,and that only May Welland betrayed, by a heightened colour (perhaps dueto the knowledge that he was watching her) a sense of the gravity ofthe situation."
10880,5," As for the cause of the commotion, she sat gracefullyin her corner of the box, her eyes fixed on the stage, and revealing,as she leaned forward, a little more shoulder and bosom than New Yorkwas accustomed to seeing, at least in ladies who had reasons forwishing to pass unnoticed.Few things seemed to Newland Archer more awful than an offence against""Taste,"" that far-off divinity of whom ""Form"" was the mere visiblerepresentative and vicegerent."
10881,5, Madame Olenska's pale and serious faceappealed to his fancy as suited to the occasion and to her unhappysituation; but the way her dress (which had no tucker) sloped away fromher thin shoulders shocked and troubled him.
10882,5," He hated to think of MayWelland's being exposed to the influence of a young woman so carelessof the dictates of Taste.""After all,"" he heard one of the younger men begin behind him(everybody talked through the Mephistopheles-and-Martha scenes), ""afterall, just WHAT happened?""""Well--she left him; nobody attempts to deny that.""""He's an awful brute, isn't he?"" continued the young enquirer, a candidThorley, who was evidently preparing to enter the lists as the lady'schampion.""The very worst; I knew him at Nice,"" said Lawrence Lefferts withauthority."
10883,5," ""A half-paralysed white sneering fellow--rather handsomehead, but eyes with a lot of lashes."
10884,5," Well, I'll tell you the sort:when he wasn't with women he was collecting china."
10885,5," Paying any pricefor both, I understand.""There was a general laugh, and the young champion said:  ""Well,then----?""""Well, then; she bolted with his secretary.""""Oh, I see.""  The champion's face fell.""It didn't last long, though: I heard of her a few months later livingalone in Venice."
10886,5, I believe Lovell Mingott went out to get her.
10887,5, Hesaid she was desperately unhappy.
10888,5," That's all right--but this paradingher at the Opera's another thing.""""Perhaps,"" young Thorley hazarded, ""she's too unhappy to be left athome.""This was greeted with an irreverent laugh, and the youth blusheddeeply, and tried to look as if he had meant to insinuate what knowingpeople called a ""double entendre.""""Well--it's queer to have brought Miss Welland, anyhow,"" some one saidin a low tone, with a side-glance at Archer.""Oh, that's part of the campaign: Granny's orders, no doubt,"" Leffertslaughed."
10889,5," ""When the old lady does a thing she does it thoroughly.""The act was ending, and there was a general stir in the box."
10890,5, SuddenlyNewland Archer felt himself impelled to decisive action.
10891,5, The desire tobe the first man to enter Mrs.
10892,5,"Mingott's box, to proclaim to thewaiting world his engagement to May Welland, and to see her throughwhatever difficulties her cousin's anomalous situation might involveher in; this impulse had abruptly overruled all scruples andhesitations, and sent him hurrying through the red corridors to thefarther side of the house.As he entered the box his eyes met Miss Welland's, and he saw that shehad instantly understood his motive, though the family dignity whichboth considered so high a virtue would not permit her to tell him so.The persons of their world lived in an atmosphere of faint implicationsand pale delicacies, and the fact that he and she understood each otherwithout a word seemed to the young man to bring them nearer than anyexplanation would have done."
10893,5," Her eyes said:  ""You see why Mammabrought me,"" and his answered:  ""I would not for the world have had youstay away.""""You know my niece Countess Olenska?"" Mrs."
10894,5,Welland enquired as sheshook hands with her future son-in-law.
10895,5," Archer bowed without extendinghis hand, as was the custom on being introduced to a lady; and EllenOlenska bent her head slightly, keeping her own pale-gloved handsclasped on her huge fan of eagle feathers."
10896,5, Having greeted Mrs.
10897,5,"LovellMingott, a large blonde lady in creaking satin, he sat down beside hisbetrothed, and said in a low tone:  ""I hope you've told Madame Olenskathat we're engaged?  I want everybody to know--I want you to let meannounce it this evening at the ball.""Miss Welland's face grew rosy as the dawn, and she looked at him withradiant eyes."
10898,5," ""If you can persuade Mamma,"" she said; ""but why shouldwe change what is already settled?""  He made no answer but that whichhis eyes returned, and she added, still more confidently smiling:""Tell my cousin yourself: I give you leave."
10899,5," She says she used to playwith you when you were children.""She made way for him by pushing back her chair, and promptly, and alittle ostentatiously, with the desire that the whole house should seewhat he was doing, Archer seated himself at the Countess Olenska's side.""We DID use to play together, didn't we?"" she asked, turning her graveeyes to his."
10900,5," ""You were a horrid boy, and kissed me once behind a door;but it was your cousin Vandie Newland, who never looked at me, that Iwas in love with.""  Her glance swept the horse-shoe curve of boxes.""Ah, how this brings it all back to me--I see everybody here inknickerbockers and pantalettes,"" she said, with her trailing slightlyforeign accent, her eyes returning to his face.Agreeable as their expression was, the young man was shocked that theyshould reflect so unseemly a picture of the august tribunal beforewhich, at that very moment, her case was being tried."
10901,5," Nothing could bein worse taste than misplaced flippancy; and he answered somewhatstiffly:  ""Yes, you have been away a very long time.""""Oh, centuries and centuries; so long,"" she said, ""that I'm sure I'mdead and buried, and this dear old place is heaven;"" which, for reasonshe could not define, struck Newland Archer as an even moredisrespectful way of describing New York society.III.It invariably happened in the same way.Mrs."
10902,5,"Julius Beaufort, on the night of her annual ball, never failed toappear at the Opera; indeed, she always gave her ball on an Opera nightin order to emphasise her complete superiority to household cares, andher possession of a staff of servants competent to organise everydetail of the entertainment in her absence.The Beauforts' house was one of the few in New York that possessed aball-room (it antedated even Mrs."
10903,5,"Manson Mingott's and the HeadlyChiverses'); and at a time when it was beginning to be thought""provincial"" to put a ""crash"" over the drawing-room floor and move thefurniture upstairs, the possession of a ball-room that was used for noother purpose, and left for three-hundred-and-sixty-four days of theyear to shuttered darkness, with its gilt chairs stacked in a cornerand its chandelier in a bag; this undoubted superiority was felt tocompensate for whatever was regrettable in the Beaufort past.Mrs."
10904,5,"Archer, who was fond of coining her social philosophy into axioms,had once said:  ""We all have our pet common people--"" and though thephrase was a daring one, its truth was secretly admitted in many anexclusive bosom."
10905,5, But the Beauforts were not exactly common; somepeople said they were even worse.
10906,5, Mrs.
10907,5,"Beaufort belonged indeed to oneof America's most honoured families; she had been the lovely ReginaDallas (of the South Carolina branch), a penniless beauty introduced toNew York society by her cousin, the imprudent Medora Manson, who wasalways doing the wrong thing from the right motive."
10908,5," When one wasrelated to the Mansons and the Rushworths one had a ""droit de cite"" (asMr."
10909,5,"Sillerton Jackson, who had frequented the Tuileries, called it) inNew York society; but did one not forfeit it in marrying JuliusBeaufort?The question was: who was Beaufort?  He passed for an Englishman, wasagreeable, handsome, ill-tempered, hospitable and witty."
10910,5, He had cometo America with letters of recommendation from old Mrs.
10911,5,"MansonMingott's English son-in-law, the banker, and had speedily made himselfan important position in the world of affairs; but his habits weredissipated, his tongue was bitter, his antecedents were mysterious; andwhen Medora Manson announced her cousin's engagement to him it was feltto be one more act of folly in poor Medora's long record of imprudences.But folly is as often justified of her children as wisdom, and twoyears after young Mrs."
10912,5,Beaufort's marriage it was admitted that she hadthe most distinguished house in New York.
10913,5, No one knew exactly how themiracle was accomplished.
10914,5," She was indolent, passive, the caustic evencalled her dull; but dressed like an idol, hung with pearls, growingyounger and blonder and more beautiful each year, she throned in Mr.Beaufort's heavy brown-stone palace, and drew all the world therewithout lifting her jewelled little finger."
10915,5," The knowing people said itwas Beaufort himself who trained the servants, taught the chef newdishes, told the gardeners what hot-house flowers to grow for thedinner-table and the drawing-rooms, selected the guests, brewed theafter-dinner punch and dictated the little notes his wife wrote to herfriends."
10916,5," If he did, these domestic activities were privatelyperformed, and he presented to the world the appearance of a carelessand hospitable millionaire strolling into his own drawing-room with thedetachment of an invited guest, and saying:  ""My wife's gloxinias are amarvel, aren't they?  I believe she gets them out from Kew.""Mr."
10917,5,"Beaufort's secret, people were agreed, was the way he carriedthings off."
10918,5," It was all very well to whisper that he had been ""helped""to leave England by the international banking-house in which he hadbeen employed; he carried off that rumour as easily as the rest--thoughNew York's business conscience was no less sensitive than its moralstandard--he carried everything before him, and all New York into hisdrawing-rooms, and for over twenty years now people had said they were""going to the Beauforts'"" with the same tone of security as if they hadsaid they were going to Mrs."
10919,5,"Manson Mingott's, and with the addedsatisfaction of knowing they would get hot canvas-back ducks andvintage wines, instead of tepid Veuve Clicquot without a year andwarmed-up croquettes from Philadelphia.Mrs."
10920,5,"Beaufort, then, had as usual appeared in her box just before theJewel Song; and when, again as usual, she rose at the end of the thirdact, drew her opera cloak about her lovely shoulders, and disappeared,New York knew that meant that half an hour later the ball would begin.The Beaufort house was one that New Yorkers were proud to show toforeigners, especially on the night of the annual ball."
10921,5," The Beaufortshad been among the first people in New York to own their own red velvetcarpet and have it rolled down the steps by their own footmen, undertheir own awning, instead of hiring it with the supper and theball-room chairs."
10922,5," They had also inaugurated the custom of letting theladies take their cloaks off in the hall, instead of shuffling up tothe hostess's bedroom and recurling their hair with the aid of thegas-burner; Beaufort was understood to have said that he supposed allhis wife's friends had maids who saw to it that they were properlycoiffees when they left home.Then the house had been boldly planned with a ball-room, so that,instead of squeezing through a narrow passage to get to it (as at theChiverses') one marched solemnly down a vista of enfiladeddrawing-rooms (the sea-green, the crimson and the bouton d'or), seeingfrom afar the many-candled lustres reflected in the polished parquetry,and beyond that the depths of a conservatory where camellias andtree-ferns arched their costly foliage over seats of black and goldbamboo.Newland Archer, as became a young man of his position, strolled insomewhat late."
10923,5," He had left his overcoat with the silk-stockingedfootmen (the stockings were one of Beaufort's few fatuities), haddawdled a while in the library hung with Spanish leather and furnishedwith Buhl and malachite, where a few men were chatting and putting ontheir dancing-gloves, and had finally joined the line of guests whomMrs."
10924,5,Beaufort was receiving on the threshold of the crimsondrawing-room.Archer was distinctly nervous.
10925,5," He had not gone back to his club afterthe Opera (as the young bloods usually did), but, the night being fine,had walked for some distance up Fifth Avenue before turning back in thedirection of the Beauforts' house."
10926,5," He was definitely afraid that theMingotts might be going too far; that, in fact, they might have GrannyMingott's orders to bring the Countess Olenska to the ball.From the tone of the club box he had perceived how grave a mistake thatwould be; and, though he was more than ever determined to ""see thething through,"" he felt less chivalrously eager to champion hisbetrothed's cousin than before their brief talk at the Opera.Wandering on to the bouton d'or drawing-room (where Beaufort had hadthe audacity to hang ""Love Victorious,"" the much-discussed nude ofBouguereau) Archer found Mrs."
10927,5,Welland and her daughter standing nearthe ball-room door.
10928,5," Couples were already gliding over the floorbeyond: the light of the wax candles fell on revolving tulle skirts, ongirlish heads wreathed with modest blossoms, on the dashing aigrettesand ornaments of the young married women's coiffures, and on theglitter of highly glazed shirt-fronts and fresh glace gloves.Miss Welland, evidently about to join the dancers, hung on thethreshold, her lilies-of-the-valley in her hand (she carried no otherbouquet), her face a little pale, her eyes burning with a candidexcitement."
10929,5," A group of young men and girls were gathered about her,and there was much hand-clasping, laughing and pleasantry on which Mrs.Welland, standing slightly apart, shed the beam of a qualifiedapproval."
10930,5," It was evident that Miss Welland was in the act ofannouncing her engagement, while her mother affected the air ofparental reluctance considered suitable to the occasion.Archer paused a moment."
10931,5," It was at his express wish that theannouncement had been made, and yet it was not thus that he would havewished to have his happiness known."
10932,5, To proclaim it in the heat andnoise of a crowded ball-room was to rob it of the fine bloom of privacywhich should belong to things nearest the heart.
10933,5, His joy was so deepthat this blurring of the surface left its essence untouched; but hewould have liked to keep the surface pure too.
10934,5, It was something of asatisfaction to find that May Welland shared this feeling.
10935,5," Her eyesfled to his beseechingly, and their look said:  ""Remember, we're doingthis because it's right.""No appeal could have found a more immediate response in Archer'sbreast; but he wished that the necessity of their action had beenrepresented by some ideal reason, and not simply by poor Ellen Olenska.The group about Miss Welland made way for him with significant smiles,and after taking his share of the felicitations he drew his betrothedinto the middle of the ball-room floor and put his arm about her waist.""Now we shan't have to talk,"" he said, smiling into her candid eyes, asthey floated away on the soft waves of the Blue Danube.She made no answer."
10936,5," Her lips trembled into a smile, but the eyesremained distant and serious, as if bent on some ineffable vision.""Dear,"" Archer whispered, pressing her to him: it was borne in on himthat the first hours of being engaged, even if spent in a ball-room,had in them something grave and sacramental."
10937,5," What a new life it wasgoing to be, with this whiteness, radiance, goodness at one's side!The dance over, the two, as became an affianced couple, wandered intothe conservatory; and sitting behind a tall screen of tree-ferns andcamellias Newland pressed her gloved hand to his lips.""You see I did as you asked me to,"" she said.""Yes: I couldn't wait,"" he answered smiling."
10938,5," After a moment he added:""Only I wish it hadn't had to be at a ball.""""Yes, I know.""  She met his glance comprehendingly."
10939,5," ""But afterall--even here we're alone together, aren't we?""""Oh, dearest--always!"" Archer cried.Evidently she was always going to understand; she was always going tosay the right thing."
10940,5," The discovery made the cup of his bliss overflow,and he went on gaily:  ""The worst of it is that I want to kiss you andI can't.""  As he spoke he took a swift glance about the conservatory,assured himself of their momentary privacy, and catching her to himlaid a fugitive pressure on her lips."
10941,5," To counteract the audacity ofthis proceeding he led her to a bamboo sofa in a less secluded part ofthe conservatory, and sitting down beside her broke alily-of-the-valley from her bouquet."
10942,5," She sat silent, and the world laylike a sunlit valley at their feet.""Did you tell my cousin Ellen?"" she asked presently, as if she spokethrough a dream.He roused himself, and remembered that he had not done so."
10943,5," Someinvincible repugnance to speak of such things to the strange foreignwoman had checked the words on his lips.""No--I hadn't the chance after all,"" he said, fibbing hastily.""Ah.""  She looked disappointed, but gently resolved on gaining herpoint."
10944,5," ""You must, then, for I didn't either; and I shouldn't like herto think--""""Of course not."
10945,5," But aren't you, after all, the person to do it?""She pondered on this."
10946,5," ""If I'd done it at the right time, yes: but nowthat there's been a delay I think you must explain that I'd asked youto tell her at the Opera, before our speaking about it to everybodyhere."
10947,5, Otherwise she might think I had forgotten her.
10948,5," You see, she'sone of the family, and she's been away so long that she'srather--sensitive.""Archer looked at her glowingly."
10949,5," ""Dear and great angel!  Of course I'lltell her.""  He glanced a trifle apprehensively toward the crowdedball-room."
10950,5," ""But I haven't seen her yet."
10951,5," Has she come?""""No; at the last minute she decided not to.""""At the last minute?"" he echoed, betraying his surprise that she shouldever have considered the alternative possible.""Yes."
10952,5," She's awfully fond of dancing,"" the young girl answered simply.""But suddenly she made up her mind that her dress wasn't smart enoughfor a ball, though we thought it so lovely; and so my aunt had to takeher home.""""Oh, well--"" said Archer with happy indifference."
10953,5," Nothing about hisbetrothed pleased him more than her resolute determination to carry toits utmost limit that ritual of ignoring the ""unpleasant"" in which theyhad both been brought up.""She knows as well as I do,"" he reflected, ""the real reason of hercousin's staying away; but I shall never let her see by the least signthat I am conscious of there being a shadow of a shade on poor EllenOlenska's reputation.""IV.In the course of the next day the first of the usual betrothal visitswere exchanged."
10954,5, The New York ritual was precise and inflexible in suchmatters; and in conformity with it Newland Archer first went with hismother and sister to call on Mrs.
10955,5,"Welland, after which he and Mrs.Welland and May drove out to old Mrs."
10956,5,Manson Mingott's to receive thatvenerable ancestress's blessing.A visit to Mrs.
10957,5,Manson Mingott was always an amusing episode to theyoung man.
10958,5," The house in itself was already an historic document,though not, of course, as venerable as certain other old family housesin University Place and lower Fifth Avenue."
10959,5," Those were of the purest1830, with a grim harmony of cabbage-rose-garlanded carpets, rosewoodconsoles, round-arched fire-places with black marble mantels, andimmense glazed book-cases of mahogany; whereas old Mrs."
10960,5,"Mingott, whohad built her house later, had bodily cast out the massive furniture ofher prime, and mingled with the Mingott heirlooms the frivolousupholstery of the Second Empire."
10961,5," It was her habit to sit in a windowof her sitting-room on the ground floor, as if watching calmly for lifeand fashion to flow northward to her solitary doors."
10962,5," She seemed in nohurry to have them come, for her patience was equalled by herconfidence."
10963,5," She was sure that presently the hoardings, the quarries,the one-story saloons, the wooden green-houses in ragged gardens, andthe rocks from which goats surveyed the scene, would vanish before theadvance of residences as stately as her own--perhaps (for she was animpartial woman) even statelier; and that the cobble-stones over whichthe old clattering omnibuses bumped would be replaced by smoothasphalt, such as people reported having seen in Paris."
10964,5," Meanwhile, asevery one she cared to see came to HER (and she could fill her rooms aseasily as the Beauforts, and without adding a single item to the menuof her suppers), she did not suffer from her geographic isolation.The immense accretion of flesh which had descended on her in middlelife like a flood of lava on a doomed city had changed her from a plumpactive little woman with a neatly-turned foot and ankle into somethingas vast and august as a natural phenomenon."
10965,5," She had accepted thissubmergence as philosophically as all her other trials, and now, inextreme old age, was rewarded by presenting to her mirror an almostunwrinkled expanse of firm pink and white flesh, in the centre of whichthe traces of a small face survived as if awaiting excavation."
10966,5, Aflight of smooth double chins led down to the dizzy depths of astill-snowy bosom veiled in snowy muslins that were held in place by aminiature portrait of the late Mr.
10967,5,"Mingott; and around and below, waveafter wave of black silk surged away over the edges of a capaciousarmchair, with two tiny white hands poised like gulls on the surface ofthe billows.The burden of Mrs."
10968,5,"Manson Mingott's flesh had long since made itimpossible for her to go up and down stairs, and with characteristicindependence she had made her reception rooms upstairs and establishedherself (in flagrant violation of all the New York proprieties) on theground floor of her house; so that, as you sat in her sitting-roomwindow with her, you caught (through a door that was always open, and alooped-back yellow damask portiere) the unexpected vista of a bedroomwith a huge low bed upholstered like a sofa, and a toilet-table withfrivolous lace flounces and a gilt-framed mirror.Her visitors were startled and fascinated by the foreignness of thisarrangement, which recalled scenes in French fiction, and architecturalincentives to immorality such as the simple American had never dreamedof."
10969,5," That was how women with lovers lived in the wicked old societies,in apartments with all the rooms on one floor, and all the indecentpropinquities that their novels described."
10970,5," It amused Newland Archer(who had secretly situated the love-scenes of ""Monsieur de Camors"" inMrs."
10971,5,"Mingott's bedroom) to picture her blameless life led in thestage-setting of adultery; but he said to himself, with considerableadmiration, that if a lover had been what she wanted, the intrepidwoman would have had him too.To the general relief the Countess Olenska was not present in hergrandmother's drawing-room during the visit of the betrothed couple.Mrs."
10972,5,"Mingott said she had gone out; which, on a day of such glaringsunlight, and at the ""shopping hour,"" seemed in itself an indelicatething for a compromised woman to do."
10973,5," But at any rate it spared themthe embarrassment of her presence, and the faint shadow that herunhappy past might seem to shed on their radiant future."
10974,5," The visitwent off successfully, as was to have been expected."
10975,5, Old Mrs.
10976,5,"Mingottwas delighted with the engagement, which, being long foreseen bywatchful relatives, had been carefully passed upon in family council;and the engagement ring, a large thick sapphire set in invisible claws,met with her unqualified admiration.""It's the new setting: of course it shows the stone beautifully, but itlooks a little bare to old-fashioned eyes,"" Mrs."
10977,5,"Welland had explained,with a conciliatory side-glance at her future son-in-law.""Old-fashioned eyes?  I hope you don't mean mine, my dear?  I like allthe novelties,"" said the ancestress, lifting the stone to her smallbright orbs, which no glasses had ever disfigured."
10978,5," ""Very handsome,""she added, returning the jewel; ""very liberal."
10979,5, In my time a cameo setin pearls was thought sufficient.
10980,5," But it's the hand that sets off thering, isn't it, my dear Mr."
10981,5,"Archer?"" and she waved one of her tinyhands, with small pointed nails and rolls of aged fat encircling thewrist like ivory bracelets."
10982,5," ""Mine was modelled in Rome by the greatFerrigiani."
10983,5," You should have May's done: no doubt he'll have it done,my child."
10984,5," Her hand is large--it's these modern sports that spread thejoints--but the skin is white.--And when's the wedding to be?"" shebroke off, fixing her eyes on Archer's face.""Oh--"" Mrs."
10985,5,"Welland murmured, while the young man, smiling at hisbetrothed, replied:  ""As soon as ever it can, if only you'll back meup, Mrs."
10986,5,"Mingott.""""We must give them time to get to know each other a little better,mamma,"" Mrs."
10987,5,"Welland interposed, with the proper affectation ofreluctance; to which the ancestress rejoined:  ""Know each other?Fiddlesticks!  Everybody in New York has always known everybody."
10988,5," Letthe young man have his way, my dear; don't wait till the bubble's offthe wine."
10989,5," Marry them before Lent; I may catch pneumonia any winternow, and I want to give the wedding-breakfast.""These successive statements were received with the proper expressionsof amusement, incredulity and gratitude; and the visit was breaking upin a vein of mild pleasantry when the door opened to admit the CountessOlenska, who entered in bonnet and mantle followed by the unexpectedfigure of Julius Beaufort.There was a cousinly murmur of pleasure between the ladies, and Mrs.Mingott held out Ferrigiani's model to the banker."
10990,5," ""Ha!  Beaufort,this is a rare favour!"" (She had an odd foreign way of addressing menby their surnames.)""Thanks."
10991,5," I wish it might happen oftener,"" said the visitor in his easyarrogant way."
10992,5," ""I'm generally so tied down; but I met the CountessEllen in Madison Square, and she was good enough to let me walk homewith her.""""Ah--I hope the house will be gayer, now that Ellen's here!"" cried Mrs.Mingott with a glorious effrontery."
10993,5," ""Sit down--sit down, Beaufort:push up the yellow armchair; now I've got you I want a good gossip."
10994,5," Ihear your ball was magnificent; and I understand you invited Mrs.Lemuel Struthers?  Well--I've a curiosity to see the woman myself.""She had forgotten her relatives, who were drifting out into the hallunder Ellen Olenska's guidance."
10995,5, Old Mrs.
10996,5,"Mingott had always professeda great admiration for Julius Beaufort, and there was a kind of kinshipin their cool domineering way and their short-cuts through theconventions."
10997,5, Now she was eagerly curious to know what had decided theBeauforts to invite (for the first time) Mrs.
10998,5,"Lemuel Struthers, thewidow of Struthers's Shoe-polish, who had returned the previous yearfrom a long initiatory sojourn in Europe to lay siege to the tightlittle citadel of New York."
10999,5," ""Of course if you and Regina invite herthe thing is settled."
11000,5," Well, we need new blood and new money--and Ihear she's still very good-looking,"" the carnivorous old lady declared.In the hall, while Mrs."
11001,5,"Welland and May drew on their furs, Archer sawthat the Countess Olenska was looking at him with a faintly questioningsmile.""Of course you know already--about May and me,"" he said, answering herlook with a shy laugh."
11002,5," ""She scolded me for not giving you the newslast night at the Opera: I had her orders to tell you that we wereengaged--but I couldn't, in that crowd.""The smile passed from Countess Olenska's eyes to her lips: she lookedyounger, more like the bold brown Ellen Mingott of his boyhood."
11003,5," ""Ofcourse I know; yes."
11004,5, And I'm so glad.
11005,5," But one doesn't tell such thingsfirst in a crowd.""  The ladies were on the threshold and she held outher hand.""Good-bye; come and see me some day,"" she said, still looking at Archer.In the carriage, on the way down Fifth Avenue, they talked pointedly ofMrs."
11006,5,"Mingott, of her age, her spirit, and all her wonderful attributes.No one alluded to Ellen Olenska; but Archer knew that Mrs."
11007,5,"Welland wasthinking:  ""It's a mistake for Ellen to be seen, the very day after herarrival, parading up Fifth Avenue at the crowded hour with JuliusBeaufort--"" and the young man himself mentally added:  ""And she oughtto know that a man who's just engaged doesn't spend his time calling onmarried women."
11008,5," But I daresay in the set she's lived in they do--theynever do anything else."" And, in spite of the cosmopolitan views onwhich he prided himself, he thanked heaven that he was a New Yorker,and about to ally himself with one of his own kind.V.The next evening old Mr."
11009,5,Sillerton Jackson came to dine with theArchers.Mrs.
11010,5,Archer was a shy woman and shrank from society; but she liked tobe well-informed as to its doings.
11011,5, Her old friend Mr.
11012,5,"SillertonJackson applied to the investigation of his friends' affairs thepatience of a collector and the science of a naturalist; and hissister, Miss Sophy Jackson, who lived with him, and was entertained byall the people who could not secure her much-sought-after brother,brought home bits of minor gossip that filled out usefully the gaps inhis picture.Therefore, whenever anything happened that Mrs."
11013,5,"Archer wanted to knowabout, she asked Mr."
11014,5,"Jackson to dine; and as she honoured few peoplewith her invitations, and as she and her daughter Janey were anexcellent audience, Mr."
11015,5,Jackson usually came himself instead of sendinghis sister.
11016,5," If he could have dictated all the conditions, he wouldhave chosen the evenings when Newland was out; not because the youngman was uncongenial to him (the two got on capitally at their club) butbecause the old anecdotist sometimes felt, on Newland's part, atendency to weigh his evidence that the ladies of the family nevershowed.Mr."
11017,5,"Jackson, if perfection had been attainable on earth, would alsohave asked that Mrs."
11018,5,Archer's food should be a little better.
11019,5," But thenNew York, as far back as the mind of man could travel, had been dividedinto the two great fundamental groups of the Mingotts and Mansons andall their clan, who cared about eating and clothes and money, and theArcher-Newland-van-der-Luyden tribe, who were devoted to travel,horticulture and the best fiction, and looked down on the grosser formsof pleasure.You couldn't have everything, after all."
11020,5," If you dined with the LovellMingotts you got canvas-back and terrapin and vintage wines; at AdelineArcher's you could talk about Alpine scenery and ""The Marble Faun""; andluckily the Archer Madeira had gone round the Cape."
11021,5, Therefore when afriendly summons came from Mrs.
11022,5,"Archer, Mr."
11023,5,"Jackson, who was a trueeclectic, would usually say to his sister:  ""I've been a little goutysince my last dinner at the Lovell Mingotts'--it will do me good todiet at Adeline's.""Mrs."
11024,5,"Archer, who had long been a widow, lived with her son and daughterin West Twenty-eighth Street."
11025,5," An upper floor was dedicated to Newland,and the two women squeezed themselves into narrower quarters below."
11026,5," Inan unclouded harmony of tastes and interests they cultivated ferns inWardian cases, made macrame lace and wool embroidery on linen,collected American revolutionary glazed ware, subscribed to ""GoodWords,"" and read Ouida's novels for the sake of the Italian atmosphere.(They preferred those about peasant life, because of the descriptionsof scenery and the pleasanter sentiments, though in general they likednovels about people in society, whose motives and habits were morecomprehensible, spoke severely of Dickens, who ""had never drawn agentleman,"" and considered Thackeray less at home in the great worldthan Bulwer--who, however, was beginning to be thought old-fashioned.)Mrs."
11027,5,and Miss Archer were both great lovers of scenery.
11028,5," It was whatthey principally sought and admired on their occasional travels abroad;considering architecture and painting as subjects for men, and chieflyfor learned persons who read Ruskin."
11029,5, Mrs.
11030,5,"Archer had been born aNewland, and mother and daughter, who were as like as sisters, wereboth, as people said, ""true Newlands""; tall, pale, and slightlyround-shouldered, with long noses, sweet smiles and a kind of droopingdistinction like that in certain faded Reynolds portraits."
11031,5, Theirphysical resemblance would have been complete if an elderly embonpointhad not stretched Mrs.
11032,5,"Archer's black brocade, while Miss Archer'sbrown and purple poplins hung, as the years went on, more and moreslackly on her virgin frame.Mentally, the likeness between them, as Newland was aware, was lesscomplete than their identical mannerisms often made it appear."
11033,5," Thelong habit of living together in mutually dependent intimacy had giventhem the same vocabulary, and the same habit of beginning their phrases""Mother thinks"" or ""Janey thinks,"" according as one or the other wishedto advance an opinion of her own; but in reality, while Mrs."
11034,5,"Archer'sserene unimaginativeness rested easily in the accepted and familiar,Janey was subject to starts and aberrations of fancy welling up fromsprings of suppressed romance.Mother and daughter adored each other and revered their son andbrother; and Archer loved them with a tenderness made compunctious anduncritical by the sense of their exaggerated admiration, and by hissecret satisfaction in it."
11035,5," After all, he thought it a good thing for aman to have his authority respected in his own house, even if his senseof humour sometimes made him question the force of his mandate.On this occasion the young man was very sure that Mr."
11036,5,"Jackson wouldrather have had him dine out; but he had his own reasons for not doingso.Of course old Jackson wanted to talk about Ellen Olenska, and of courseMrs."
11037,5,Archer and Janey wanted to hear what he had to tell.
11038,5," All threewould be slightly embarrassed by Newland's presence, now that hisprospective relation to the Mingott clan had been made known; and theyoung man waited with an amused curiosity to see how they would turnthe difficulty.They began, obliquely, by talking about Mrs."
11039,5,"Lemuel Struthers.""It's a pity the Beauforts asked her,"" Mrs."
11040,5,Archer said gently.
11041,5," ""Butthen Regina always does what he tells her; and BEAUFORT--""""Certain nuances escape Beaufort,"" said Mr."
11042,5,"Jackson, cautiouslyinspecting the broiled shad, and wondering for the thousandth time whyMrs."
11043,5,Archer's cook always burnt the roe to a cinder.
11044,5,"(Newland, who hadlong shared his wonder, could always detect it in the older man'sexpression of melancholy disapproval.)""Oh, necessarily; Beaufort is a vulgar man,"" said Mrs."
11045,5,Archer.
11046,5," ""Mygrandfather Newland always used to say to my mother:  'Whatever you do,don't let that fellow Beaufort be introduced to the girls.'  But atleast he's had the advantage of associating with gentlemen; in Englandtoo, they say."
11047,5," It's all very mysterious--"" She glanced at Janey andpaused."
11048,5," She and Janey knew every fold of the Beaufort mystery, but inpublic Mrs."
11049,5,"Archer continued to assume that the subject was not one forthe unmarried.""But this Mrs."
11050,5,"Struthers,"" Mrs."
11051,5,"Archer continued; ""what did you say SHEwas, Sillerton?""""Out of a mine: or rather out of the saloon at the head of the pit.Then with Living Wax-Works, touring New England."
11052,5," After the policebroke THAT up, they say she lived--""  Mr."
11053,5,"Jackson in his turn glancedat Janey, whose eyes began to bulge from under her prominent lids.There were still hiatuses for her in Mrs."
11054,5,"Struthers's past.""Then,"" Mr."
11055,5,"Jackson continued (and Archer saw he was wondering why noone had told the butler never to slice cucumbers with a steel knife),""then Lemuel Struthers came along."
11056,5," They say his advertiser used thegirl's head for the shoe-polish posters; her hair's intensely black,you know--the Egyptian style."
11057,5," Anyhow, he--eventually--married her.""There were volumes of innuendo in the way the ""eventually"" was spaced,and each syllable given its due stress.""Oh, well--at the pass we've come to nowadays, it doesn't matter,"" saidMrs."
11058,5,Archer indifferently.
11059,5, The ladies were not really interested inMrs.
11060,5,Struthers just then; the subject of Ellen Olenska was too freshand too absorbing to them.
11061,5," Indeed, Mrs."
11062,5,Struthers's name had beenintroduced by Mrs.
11063,5,"Archer only that she might presently be able to say:""And Newland's new cousin--Countess Olenska?  Was SHE at the ball too?""There was a faint touch of sarcasm in the reference to her son, andArcher knew it and had expected it."
11064,5, Even Mrs.
11065,5,"Archer, who was seldomunduly pleased with human events, had been altogether glad of her son'sengagement."
11066,5,"(""Especially after that silly business with Mrs.Rushworth,"" as she had remarked to Janey, alluding to what had onceseemed to Newland a tragedy of which his soul would always bear thescar.)There was no better match in New York than May Welland, look at thequestion from whatever point you chose."
11067,5, Of course such a marriage wasonly what Newland was entitled to; but young men are so foolish andincalculable--and some women so ensnaring and unscrupulous--that it wasnothing short of a miracle to see one's only son safe past the SirenIsle and in the haven of a blameless domesticity.All this Mrs.
11068,5,"Archer felt, and her son knew she felt; but he knew alsothat she had been perturbed by the premature announcement of hisengagement, or rather by its cause; and it was for that reason--becauseon the whole he was a tender and indulgent master--that he had stayedat home that evening."
11069,5," ""It's not that I don't approve of the Mingotts'esprit de corps; but why Newland's engagement should be mixed up withthat Olenska woman's comings and goings I don't see,"" Mrs."
11070,5,"Archergrumbled to Janey, the only witness of her slight lapses from perfectsweetness.She had behaved beautifully--and in beautiful behaviour she wasunsurpassed--during the call on Mrs."
11071,5,"Welland; but Newland knew (and hisbetrothed doubtless guessed) that all through the visit she and Janeywere nervously on the watch for Madame Olenska's possible intrusion;and when they left the house together she had permitted herself to sayto her son:  ""I'm thankful that Augusta Welland received us alone.""These indications of inward disturbance moved Archer the more that hetoo felt that the Mingotts had gone a little too far."
11072,5," But, as it wasagainst all the rules of their code that the mother and son should everallude to what was uppermost in their thoughts, he simply replied: ""Oh,well, there's always a phase of family parties to be gone through whenone gets engaged, and the sooner it's over the better.""  At which hismother merely pursed her lips under the lace veil that hung down fromher grey velvet bonnet trimmed with frosted grapes.Her revenge, he felt--her lawful revenge--would be to ""draw"" Mr.Jackson that evening on the Countess Olenska; and, having publicly donehis duty as a future member of the Mingott clan, the young man had noobjection to hearing the lady discussed in private--except that thesubject was already beginning to bore him.Mr."
11073,5,"Jackson had helped himself to a slice of the tepid filet which themournful butler had handed him with a look as sceptical as his own, andhad rejected the mushroom sauce after a scarcely perceptible sniff."
11074,5," Helooked baffled and hungry, and Archer reflected that he would probablyfinish his meal on Ellen Olenska.Mr."
11075,5,"Jackson leaned back in his chair, and glanced up at the candlelitArchers, Newlands and van der Luydens hanging in dark frames on thedark walls.""Ah, how your grandfather Archer loved a good dinner, my dear Newland!""he said, his eyes on the portrait of a plump full-chested young man ina stock and a blue coat, with a view of a white-columned country-housebehind him."
11076,5," ""Well--well--well ..."
11077,5,"I wonder what he would have said toall these foreign marriages!""Mrs."
11078,5,"Archer ignored the allusion to the ancestral cuisine and Mr.Jackson continued with deliberation: ""No, she was NOT at the ball.""""Ah--"" Mrs."
11079,5,"Archer murmured, in a tone that implied:  ""She had thatdecency.""""Perhaps the Beauforts don't know her,"" Janey suggested, with herartless malice.Mr."
11080,5,"Jackson gave a faint sip, as if he had been tasting invisibleMadeira."
11081,5," ""Mrs."
11082,5,"Beaufort may not--but Beaufort certainly does, for shewas seen walking up Fifth Avenue this afternoon with him by the wholeof New York.""""Mercy--"" moaned Mrs."
11083,5,"Archer, evidently perceiving the uselessness oftrying to ascribe the actions of foreigners to a sense of delicacy.""I wonder if she wears a round hat or a bonnet in the afternoon,"" Janeyspeculated."
11084,5," ""At the Opera I know she had on dark blue velvet,perfectly plain and flat--like a night-gown.""""Janey!"" said her mother; and Miss Archer blushed and tried to lookaudacious.""It was, at any rate, in better taste not to go to the ball,"" Mrs.Archer continued.A spirit of perversity moved her son to rejoin:  ""I don't think it wasa question of taste with her."
11085,5," May said she meant to go, and thendecided that the dress in question wasn't smart enough.""Mrs."
11086,5,Archer smiled at this confirmation of her inference.
11087,5," ""PoorEllen,"" she simply remarked; adding compassionately:  ""We must alwaysbear in mind what an eccentric bringing-up Medora Manson gave her.What can you expect of a girl who was allowed to wear black satin ather coming-out ball?""""Ah--don't I remember her in it!"" said Mr."
11088,5,"Jackson; adding:  ""Poorgirl!"" in the tone of one who, while enjoying the memory, had fullyunderstood at the time what the sight portended.""It's odd,"" Janey remarked, ""that she should have kept such an uglyname as Ellen."
11089,5," I should have changed it to Elaine.""  She glanced aboutthe table to see the effect of this.Her brother laughed."
11090,5," ""Why Elaine?""""I don't know; it sounds more--more Polish,"" said Janey, blushing.""It sounds more conspicuous; and that can hardly be what she wishes,""said Mrs."
11091,5,"Archer distantly.""Why not?"" broke in her son, growing suddenly argumentative."
11092,5," ""Whyshouldn't she be conspicuous if she chooses?  Why should she slinkabout as if it were she who had disgraced herself?  She's 'poor Ellen'certainly, because she had the bad luck to make a wretched marriage;but I don't see that that's a reason for hiding her head as if she werethe culprit.""""That, I suppose,"" said Mr."
11093,5,"Jackson, speculatively, ""is the line theMingotts mean to take.""The young man reddened."
11094,5," ""I didn't have to wait for their cue, ifthat's what you mean, sir."
11095,5," Madame Olenska has had an unhappy life:that doesn't make her an outcast.""""There are rumours,"" began Mr."
11096,5,"Jackson, glancing at Janey.""Oh, I know: the secretary,"" the young man took him up."
11097,5," ""Nonsense,mother; Janey's grown-up."
11098,5," They say, don't they,"" he went on, ""that thesecretary helped her to get away from her brute of a husband, who kepther practically a prisoner?  Well, what if he did?  I hope there isn'ta man among us who wouldn't have done the same in such a case.""Mr."
11099,5,"Jackson glanced over his shoulder to say to the sad butler:""Perhaps ..."
11100,5,that sauce ...
11101,5,"just a little, after all--""; then, havinghelped himself, he remarked: ""I'm told she's looking for a house."
11102,5," Shemeans to live here.""""I hear she means to get a divorce,"" said Janey boldly.""I hope she will!"" Archer exclaimed.The word had fallen like a bombshell in the pure and tranquilatmosphere of the Archer dining-room."
11103,5, Mrs.
11104,5,"Archer raised her delicateeye-brows in the particular curve that signified:  ""The butler--"" andthe young man, himself mindful of the bad taste of discussing suchintimate matters in public, hastily branched off into an account of hisvisit to old Mrs."
11105,5,"Mingott.After dinner, according to immemorial custom, Mrs."
11106,5,"Archer and Janeytrailed their long silk draperies up to the drawing-room, where, whilethe gentlemen smoked below stairs, they sat beside a Carcel lamp withan engraved globe, facing each other across a rosewood work-table witha green silk bag under it, and stitched at the two ends of a tapestryband of field-flowers destined to adorn an ""occasional"" chair in thedrawing-room of young Mrs."
11107,5,"Newland Archer.While this rite was in progress in the drawing-room, Archer settled Mr.Jackson in an armchair near the fire in the Gothic library and handedhim a cigar."
11108,5, Mr.
11109,5,"Jackson sank into the armchair with satisfaction, lithis cigar with perfect confidence (it was Newland who bought them), andstretching his thin old ankles to the coals, said:  ""You say thesecretary merely helped her to get away, my dear fellow?  Well, he wasstill helping her a year later, then; for somebody met 'em living atLausanne together.""Newland reddened."
11110,5," ""Living together?  Well, why not?  Who had the rightto make her life over if she hadn't?  I'm sick of the hypocrisy thatwould bury alive a woman of her age if her husband prefers to live withharlots.""He stopped and turned away angrily to light his cigar."
11111,5," ""Women ought tobe free--as free as we are,"" he declared, making a discovery of whichhe was too irritated to measure the terrific consequences.Mr."
11112,5,"Sillerton Jackson stretched his ankles nearer the coals and emitteda sardonic whistle.""Well,"" he said after a pause, ""apparently Count Olenski takes yourview; for I never heard of his having lifted a finger to get his wifeback.""VI.That evening, after Mr."
11113,5,"Jackson had taken himself away, and the ladieshad retired to their chintz-curtained bedroom, Newland Archer mountedthoughtfully to his own study."
11114,5," A vigilant hand had, as usual, kept thefire alive and the lamp trimmed; and the room, with its rows and rowsof books, its bronze and steel statuettes of ""The Fencers"" on themantelpiece and its many photographs of famous pictures, lookedsingularly home-like and welcoming.As he dropped into his armchair near the fire his eyes rested on alarge photograph of May Welland, which the young girl had given him inthe first days of their romance, and which had now displaced all theother portraits on the table."
11115,5," With a new sense of awe he looked at thefrank forehead, serious eyes and gay innocent mouth of the youngcreature whose soul's custodian he was to be."
11116,5," That terrifying productof the social system he belonged to and believed in, the young girl whoknew nothing and expected everything, looked back at him like astranger through May Welland's familiar features; and once more it wasborne in on him that marriage was not the safe anchorage he had beentaught to think, but a voyage on uncharted seas.The case of the Countess Olenska had stirred up old settled convictionsand set them drifting dangerously through his mind."
11117,5," His ownexclamation:  ""Women should be free--as free as we are,"" struck to theroot of a problem that it was agreed in his world to regard asnon-existent."
11118,5," ""Nice"" women, however wronged, would never claim thekind of freedom he meant, and generous-minded men like himself weretherefore--in the heat of argument--the more chivalrously ready toconcede it to them."
11119,5, Such verbal generosities were in fact only ahumbugging disguise of the inexorable conventions that tied thingstogether and bound people down to the old pattern.
11120,5," But here he waspledged to defend, on the part of his betrothed's cousin, conduct that,on his own wife's part, would justify him in calling down on her allthe thunders of Church and State."
11121,5," Of course the dilemma was purelyhypothetical; since he wasn't a blackguard Polish nobleman, it wasabsurd to speculate what his wife's rights would be if he WERE."
11122,5," ButNewland Archer was too imaginative not to feel that, in his case andMay's, the tie might gall for reasons far less gross and palpable.What could he and she really know of each other, since it was his duty,as a ""decent"" fellow, to conceal his past from her, and hers, as amarriageable girl, to have no past to conceal?  What if, for some oneof the subtler reasons that would tell with both of them, they shouldtire of each other, misunderstand or irritate each other?  He reviewedhis friends' marriages--the supposedly happy ones--and saw none thatanswered, even remotely, to the passionate and tender comradeship whichhe pictured as his permanent relation with May Welland."
11123,5," He perceivedthat such a picture presupposed, on her part, the experience, theversatility, the freedom of judgment, which she had been carefullytrained not to possess; and with a shiver of foreboding he saw hismarriage becoming what most of the other marriages about him were: adull association of material and social interests held together byignorance on the one side and hypocrisy on the other."
11124,5, LawrenceLefferts occurred to him as the husband who had most completelyrealised this enviable ideal.
11125,5," As became the high-priest of form, hehad formed a wife so completely to his own convenience that, in themost conspicuous moments of his frequent love-affairs with other men'swives, she went about in smiling unconsciousness, saying that ""Lawrencewas so frightfully strict""; and had been known to blush indignantly,and avert her gaze, when some one alluded in her presence to the factthat Julius Beaufort (as became a ""foreigner"" of doubtful origin) hadwhat was known in New York as ""another establishment.""Archer tried to console himself with the thought that he was not quitesuch an ass as Larry Lefferts, nor May such a simpleton as poorGertrude; but the difference was after all one of intelligence and notof standards."
11126,5," In reality they all lived in a kind of hieroglyphicworld, where the real thing was never said or done or even thought, butonly represented by a set of arbitrary signs; as when Mrs."
11127,5,"Welland, whoknew exactly why Archer had pressed her to announce her daughter'sengagement at the Beaufort ball (and had indeed expected him to do noless), yet felt obliged to simulate reluctance, and the air of havinghad her hand forced, quite as, in the books on Primitive Man thatpeople of advanced culture were beginning to read, the savage bride isdragged with shrieks from her parents' tent.The result, of course, was that the young girl who was the centre ofthis elaborate system of mystification remained the more inscrutablefor her very frankness and assurance."
11128,5," She was frank, poor darling,because she had nothing to conceal, assured because she knew of nothingto be on her guard against; and with no better preparation than this,she was to be plunged overnight into what people evasively called ""thefacts of life.""The young man was sincerely but placidly in love."
11129,5," He delighted in theradiant good looks of his betrothed, in her health, her horsemanship,her grace and quickness at games, and the shy interest in books andideas that she was beginning to develop under his guidance."
11130,5," (She hadadvanced far enough to join him in ridiculing the Idyls of the King,but not to feel the beauty of Ulysses and the Lotus Eaters.) She wasstraightforward, loyal and brave; she had a sense of humour (chieflyproved by her laughing at HIS jokes); and he suspected, in the depthsof her innocently-gazing soul, a glow of feeling that it would be a joyto waken."
11131,5, But when he had gone the brief round of her he returneddiscouraged by the thought that all this frankness and innocence wereonly an artificial product.
11132,5, Untrained human nature was not frank andinnocent; it was full of the twists and defences of an instinctiveguile.
11133,5," And he felt himself oppressed by this creation of factitiouspurity, so cunningly manufactured by a conspiracy of mothers and auntsand grandmothers and long-dead ancestresses, because it was supposed tobe what he wanted, what he had a right to, in order that he mightexercise his lordly pleasure in smashing it like an image made of snow.There was a certain triteness in these reflections: they were thosehabitual to young men on the approach of their wedding day."
11134,5, But theywere generally accompanied by a sense of compunction and self-abasementof which Newland Archer felt no trace.
11135,5, He could not deplore (asThackeray's heroes so often exasperated him by doing) that he had not ablank page to offer his bride in exchange for the unblemished one shewas to give to him.
11136,5," He could not get away from the fact that if he hadbeen brought up as she had they would have been no more fit to findtheir way about than the Babes in the Wood; nor could he, for all hisanxious cogitations, see any honest reason (any, that is, unconnectedwith his own momentary pleasure, and the passion of masculine vanity)why his bride should not have been allowed the same freedom ofexperience as himself.Such questions, at such an hour, were bound to drift through his mind;but he was conscious that their uncomfortable persistence and precisionwere due to the inopportune arrival of the Countess Olenska."
11137,5," Here hewas, at the very moment of his betrothal--a moment for pure thoughtsand cloudless hopes--pitchforked into a coil of scandal which raisedall the special problems he would have preferred to let lie."
11138,5," ""HangEllen Olenska!"" he grumbled, as he covered his fire and began toundress."
11139,5," He could not really see why her fate should have the leastbearing on his; yet he dimly felt that he had only just begun tomeasure the risks of the championship which his engagement had forcedupon him.A few days later the bolt fell.The Lovell Mingotts had sent out cards for what was known as ""a formaldinner"" (that is, three extra footmen, two dishes for each course, anda Roman punch in the middle), and had headed their invitations with thewords ""To meet the Countess Olenska,"" in accordance with the hospitableAmerican fashion, which treats strangers as if they were royalties, orat least as their ambassadors.The guests had been selected with a boldness and discrimination inwhich the initiated recognised the firm hand of Catherine the Great.Associated with such immemorial standbys as the Selfridge Merrys, whowere asked everywhere because they always had been, the Beauforts, onwhom there was a claim of relationship, and Mr."
11140,5,"Sillerton Jackson andhis sister Sophy (who went wherever her brother told her to), were someof the most fashionable and yet most irreproachable of the dominant""young married"" set; the Lawrence Leffertses, Mrs."
11141,5,"Lefferts Rushworth(the lovely widow), the Harry Thorleys, the Reggie Chiverses and youngMorris Dagonet and his wife (who was a van der Luyden)."
11142,5," The companyindeed was perfectly assorted, since all the members belonged to thelittle inner group of people who, during the long New York season,disported themselves together daily and nightly with apparentlyundiminished zest.Forty-eight hours later the unbelievable had happened; every one hadrefused the Mingotts' invitation except the Beauforts and old Mr.Jackson and his sister."
11143,5," The intended slight was emphasised by the factthat even the Reggie Chiverses, who were of the Mingott clan, wereamong those inflicting it; and by the uniform wording of the notes, inall of which the writers ""regretted that they were unable to accept,""without the mitigating plea of a ""previous engagement"" that ordinarycourtesy prescribed.New York society was, in those days, far too small, and too scant inits resources, for every one in it (including livery-stable-keepers,butlers and cooks) not to know exactly on which evenings."
11144,5,"""Undine Spragg--how can you?"" her mother wailed, raising aprematurely-wrinkled hand heavy with rings to defend the note which alanguid ""bell-boy"" had just brought in.But her defence was as feeble as her protest, and she continued tosmile on her visitor while Miss Spragg, with a turn of her quick youngfingers, possessed herself of the missive and withdrew to the window toread it.""I guess it's meant for me,"" she merely threw over her shoulder at hermother.""Did you EVER, Mrs."
11145,5,"Heeny?"" Mrs."
11146,5,Spragg murmured with deprecating pride.Mrs.
11147,5,"Heeny, a stout professional-looking person in a waterproof, herrusty veil thrown back, and a shabby alligator bag at her feet, followedthe mother's glance with good-humoured approval.""I never met with a lovelier form,"" she agreed, answering the spiritrather than the letter of her hostess's enquiry.Mrs."
11148,5,Spragg and her visitor were enthroned in two heavy gilt armchairsin one of the private drawing-rooms of the Hotel Stentorian.
11149,5,"The Spraggrooms were known as one of the Looey suites, and the drawing-room walls,above their wainscoting of highly-varnished mahogany, were hung withsalmon-pink damask and adorned with oval portraits of Marie Antoinetteand the Princess de Lamballe."
11150,5,In the centre of the florid carpet a gilttable with a top of Mexican onyx sustained a palm in a gilt basket tiedwith a pink bow.
11151,5,"But for this ornament, and a copy of ""The Hound of theBaskervilles"" which lay beside it, the room showed no traces of humanuse, and Mrs."
11152,5,Spragg herself wore as complete an air of detachment as ifshe had been a wax figure in a show-window.
11153,5,"Her attire was fashionableenough to justify such a post, and her pale soft-cheeked face, withpuffy eye-lids and drooping mouth, suggested a partially-melted waxfigure which had run to double-chin.Mrs."
11154,5,"Heeny, in comparison, had a reassuring look of solidity andreality."
11155,5,"The planting of her firm black bulk in its chair, and thegrasp of her broad red hands on the gilt arms, bespoke an organized andself-reliant activity, accounted for by the fact that Mrs."
11156,5,"Heeny was a""society"" manicure and masseuse."
11157,5,Toward Mrs.
11158,5,"Spragg and her daughtershe filled the double role of manipulator and friend; and it was in thelatter capacity that, her day's task ended, she had dropped in for amoment to ""cheer up"" the lonely ladies of the Stentorian.The young girl whose ""form"" had won Mrs."
11159,5,"Heeny's professionalcommendation suddenly shifted its lovely lines as she turned back fromthe window.""Here--you can have it after all,"" she said, crumpling the note andtossing it with a contemptuous gesture into her mother's lap.""Why--isn't it from Mr."
11160,5,"Popple?"" Mrs."
11161,5,"Spragg exclaimed unguardedly.""No--it isn't."
11162,5,"What made you think I thought it was?"" snapped herdaughter; but the next instant she added, with an outbreak of childishdisappointment: ""It's only from Mr."
11163,5,"Marvell's sister--at least she saysshe's his sister.""Mrs."
11164,5,"Spragg, with a puzzled frown, groped for her eye-glass among thejet fringes of her tightly-girded front.Mrs."
11165,5,"Heeny's small blue eyes shot out sparks of curiosity.""Marvell--what Marvell is that?""The girl explained languidly: ""A little fellow--I think Mr."
11166,5,"Popple saidhis name was Ralph""; while her mother continued: ""Undine met them bothlast night at that party downstairs."
11167,5,And from something Mr.
11168,5,"Popple saidto her about going to one of the new plays, she thought--""""How on earth do you know what I thought?"" Undine flashed back, her greyeyes darting warnings at her mother under their straight black brows.""Why, you SAID you thought--"" Mrs."
11169,5,Spragg began reproachfully; butMrs.
11170,5,"Heeny, heedless of their bickerings, was pursuing her own train ofthought.""What Popple? Claud Walsingham Popple--the portrait painter?""""Yes--I suppose so."
11171,5,He said he'd like to paint me.
11172,5,Mabel Lipscombintroduced him.
11173,5,"I don't care if I never see him again,"" the girl said,bathed in angry pink.""Do you know him, Mrs."
11174,5,"Heeny?"" Mrs."
11175,5,"Spragg enquired.""I should say I did."

11182,5,"But he ain't nearly AS in it,""she continued judicially, ""as Ralph Marvell--the little fellow, as youcall him.""Undine Spragg, at the word, swept round on the speaker with one ofthe quick turns that revealed her youthful flexibility."
11183,5,"She was alwaysdoubling and twisting on herself, and every movement she made seemedto start at the nape of her neck, just below the lifted roll ofreddish-gold hair, and flow without a break through her whole slimlength to the tips of her fingers and the points of her slender restlessfeet.""Why, do you know the Marvells? Are THEY stylish?"" she asked.Mrs."
11184,5,"Heeny gave the discouraged gesture of a pedagogue who has vainlystriven to implant the rudiments of knowledge in a rebellious mind.""Why, Undine Spragg, I've told you all about them time and again!His mother was a Dagonet."
11185,5,"They live with old Urban Dagonet down inWashington Square.""To Mrs."
11186,5,"Spragg this conveyed even less than to her daughter, ""'way downthere? Why do they live with somebody else? Haven't they got the meansto have a home of their own?""Undine's perceptions were more rapid, and she fixed her eyes searchinglyon Mrs."
11187,5,"Heeny.""Do you mean to say Mr."
11188,5,Marvell's as swell as Mr.
11189,5,"Popple?""""As swell? Why, Claud Walsingham Popple ain't in the same class withhim!""The girl was upon her mother with a spring, snatching and smoothing outthe crumpled note.""Laura Fairford--is that the sister's name?""""Mrs."

11191,5,"What does she write about?""Undine's face lit up as if a shaft of sunset had struck it through thetriple-curtained windows of the Stentorian.""She says she wants me to dine with her next Wednesday."
11192,5,"Isn't it queer?Why does SHE want me? She's never seen me!"" Her tone implied that shehad long been accustomed to being ""wanted"" by those who had.Mrs."

11197,5,"""How queer! But they haven't allgot sisters, have they? It must be fearfully poky for the ones thathaven't.""""They get their mothers--or their married friends,"" said Mrs."
11198,5,"Heenyomnisciently.""Married gentlemen?"" enquired Mrs."
11199,5,"Spragg, slightly shocked, butgenuinely desirous of mastering her lesson.""Mercy, no! Married ladies.""""But are there never any gentlemen present?"" pursued Mrs."
11200,5,"Spragg,feeling that if this were the case Undine would certainly bedisappointed.""Present where? At their dinners? Of course--Mrs."

11211,5,Heenyadded with discrimination.Undine was brooding over the note.
11212,5,"""It IS written to mother--Mrs."
11213,5,AbnerE.
11214,5,Spragg--I never saw anything so funny! 'Will you ALLOW your daughterto dine with me?' Allow! Is Mrs.
11215,5,"Fairford peculiar?""""No--you are,"" said Mrs."
11216,5,Heeny bluntly.
11217,5,"""Don't you know it's the thingin the best society to pretend that girls can't do anything withouttheir mothers' permission? You just remember that."
11218,5,Undine.
11219,5,"You mustn'taccept invitations from gentlemen without you say you've got to ask yourmother first.""""Mercy! But how'll mother know what to say?""""Why, she'll say what you tell her to, of course."
11220,5,You'd better tell heryou want to dine with Mrs.
11221,5,"Fairford,"" Mrs."
11222,5,"Heeny added humorously, asshe gathered her waterproof together and stooped for her bag.""Have I got to write the note, then?"" Mrs."
11223,5,Spragg asked with risingagitation.Mrs.
11224,5,Heeny reflected.
11225,5,"""Why, no."
11226,5,I guess Undine can write it as if it wasfrom you.
11227,5,Mrs.
11228,5,"Fairford don't know your writing.""This was an evident relief to Mrs."
11229,5,"Spragg, and as Undine swept to herroom with the note her mother sank back, murmuring plaintively: ""Oh,don't go yet, Mrs."
11230,5,Heeny.
11231,5,"I haven't seen a human being all day, and Ican't seem to find anything to say to that French maid.""Mrs."
11232,5,Heeny looked at her hostess with friendly compassion.
11233,5,She was wellaware that she was the only bright spot on Mrs.
11234,5,Spragg's horizon.
11235,5,"Sincethe Spraggs, some two years previously, had moved from Apex City to NewYork, they had made little progress in establishing relations with theirnew environment; and when, about four months earlier, Mrs."
11236,5,Spragg'sdoctor had called in Mrs.
11237,5,"Heeny to minister professionally to hispatient, he had done more for her spirit than for her body."
11238,5,Mrs.
11239,5,"Heenyhad had such ""cases"" before: she knew the rich helpless family, strandedin lonely splendour in a sumptuous West Side hotel, with a fathercompelled to seek a semblance of social life at the hotel bar, anda mother deprived of even this contact with her kind, and reduced toillness by boredom and inactivity."
11240,5,Poor Mrs.
11241,5,"Spragg had done her ownwashing in her youth, but since her rising fortunes had made thisoccupation unsuitable she had sunk into the relative inertia which theladies of Apex City regarded as one of the prerogatives of affluence."
11242,5,"AtApex, however, she had belonged to a social club, and, until they movedto the Mealey House, had been kept busy by the incessant struggle withdomestic cares; whereas New York seemed to offer no field for any formof lady-like activity."
11243,5,"She therefore took her exercise vicariously, withMrs."
11244,5,Heeny's help; and Mrs.
11245,5,Heeny knew how to manipulate her imaginationas well as her muscles.
11246,5,It was Mrs.
11247,5,"Heeny who peopled the solitudeof the long ghostly days with lively anecdotes of the Van Degens, theDriscolls, the Chauncey Ellings and the other social potentates whoseleast doings Mrs."
11248,5,"Spragg and Undine had followed from afar in the Apexpapers, and who had come to seem so much more remote since only thewidth of the Central Park divided mother and daughter from theirOlympian portals.Mrs."
11249,5,"Spragg had no ambition for herself--she seemed to have transferredher whole personality to her child--but she was passionately resolvedthat Undine should have what she wanted, and she sometimes fancied thatMrs."
11250,5,"Heeny, who crossed those sacred thresholds so familiarly, mightsome day gain admission for Undine.""Well--I'll stay a little mite longer if you want; and supposing I wasto rub up your nails while we're talking? It'll be more sociable,"" themasseuse suggested, lifting her bag to the table and covering its shinyonyx surface with bottles and polishers.Mrs."
11251,5,Spragg consentingly slipped the rings from her small mottled hands.It was soothing to feel herself in Mrs.
11252,5,"Heeny's grasp, and though sheknew the attention would cost her three dollars she was secure in thesense that Abner wouldn't mind."
11253,5,It had been clear to Mrs.
11254,5,"Spragg, eversince their rather precipitate departure from Apex City, that Abner wasresolved not to mind--resolved at any cost to ""see through"" the New Yorkadventure."
11255,5,It seemed likely now that the cost would be considerable.They had lived in New York for two years without any social benefitto their daughter; and it was of course for that purpose that they hadcome.
11256,5,"If, at the time, there had been other and more pressing reasons,they were such as Mrs."
11257,5,"Spragg and her husband never touched on, even inthe gilded privacy of their bedroom at the Stentorian; and so completelyhad silence closed in on the subject that to Mrs."
11258,5,"Spragg it had becomenon-existent: she really believed that, as Abner put it, they had leftApex because Undine was too big for the place.She seemed as yet--poor child!--too small for New York: actuallyimperceptible to its heedless multitudes; and her mother trembled forthe day when her invisibility should be borne in on her."
11259,5,Mrs.
11260,5,Spraggdid not mind the long delay for herself--she had stores of lymphaticpatience.
11261,5,"But she had noticed lately that Undine was beginning to benervous, and there was nothing that Undine's parents dreaded so much asher being nervous."
11262,5,Mrs.
11263,5,"Spragg's maternal apprehensions unconsciouslyescaped in her next words.""I do hope she'll quiet down now,"" she murmured, feeling quieter herselfas her hand sank into Mrs."
11264,5,"Heeny's roomy palm.""Who's that? Undine?""""Yes."
11265,5,She seemed so set on that Mr.
11266,5,Popple's coming round.
11267,5,"From the wayhe acted last night she thought he'd be sure to come round this morning.She's so lonesome, poor child--I can't say as I blame her.""""Oh, he'll come round."
11268,5,"Things don't happen as quick as that in NewYork,"" said Mrs."
11269,5,"Heeny, driving her nail-polisher cheeringly.Mrs."
11270,5,Spragg sighed again.
11271,5,"""They don't appear to."
11272,5,"They say New Yorkersare always in a hurry; but I can't say as they've hurried much to makeour acquaintance.""Mrs."
11273,5,Heeny drew back to study the effect of her work.
11274,5,"""You wait, Mrs.Spragg, you wait."
11275,5,"If you go too fast you sometimes have to rip out thewhole seam.""""Oh, that's so--that's SO!"" Mrs."
11276,5,"Spragg exclaimed, with a tragicemphasis that made the masseuse glance up at her.""Of course it's so."
11277,5,And it's more so in New York than anywhere.
11278,5,"Thewrong set's like fly-paper: once you're in it you can pull and pull, butyou'll never get out of it again.""Undine's mother heaved another and more helpless sigh."
11279,5,"""I wish YOU'Dtell Undine that, Mrs."
11280,5,"Heeny.""""Oh, I guess Undine's all right."
11281,5,"A girl like her can afford to wait.And if young Marvell's really taken with her she'll have the run of theplace in no time.""This solacing thought enabled Mrs."
11282,5,Spragg to yield herself unreservedlyto Mrs.
11283,5,"Heeny's ministrations, which were prolonged for a happyconfidential hour; and she had just bidden the masseuse good-bye, andwas restoring the rings to her fingers, when the door opened to admither husband.Mr."
11284,5,"Spragg came in silently, setting his high hat down on thecentre-table, and laying his overcoat across one of the gilt chairs."
11285,5,"Hewas tallish, grey-bearded and somewhat stooping, with the slack figureof the sedentary man who would be stout if he were not dyspeptic; andhis cautious grey eyes with pouch-like underlids had straight blackbrows like his daughter's."
11286,5,"His thin hair was worn a little too long overhis coat collar, and a Masonic emblem dangled from the heavy gold chainwhich crossed his crumpled black waistcoat.He stood still in the middle of the room, casting a slow pioneeringglance about its gilded void; then he said gently: ""Well, mother?""Mrs."
11287,5,"Spragg remained seated, but her eyes dwelt on him affectionately.""Undine's been asked out to a dinner-party; and Mrs."
11288,5,Heeny says it's toone of the first families.
11289,5,"It's the sister of one of the gentlemen thatMabel Lipscomb introduced her to last night.""There was a mild triumph in her tone, for it was owing to her insistenceand Undine's that Mr."
11290,5,"Spragg had been induced to give up the housethey had bought in West End Avenue, and move with his family to theStentorian."
11291,5,"Undine had early decided that they could not hope to geton while they ""kept house""--all the fashionable people she knew eitherboarded or lived in hotels."
11292,5,Mrs.
11293,5,"Spragg was easily induced to takethe same view, but Mr."
11294,5,"Spragg had resisted, being at the moment unableeither to sell his house or to let it as advantageously as he had hoped.After the move was made it seemed for a time as though he had beenright, and the first social steps would be as difficult to make in ahotel as in one's own house; and Mrs."
11295,5,"Spragg was therefore eager to havehim know that Undine really owed her first invitation to a meeting underthe roof of the Stentorian.""You see we were right to come here, Abner,"" she added, and he absentlyrejoined: ""I guess you two always manage to be right.""But his face remained unsmiling, and instead of seating himself andlighting his cigar, as he usually did before dinner, he took two orthree aimless turns about the room, and then paused in front of hiswife.""What's the matter--anything wrong down town?"" she asked, her eyesreflecting his anxiety.Mrs."
11296,5,"Spragg's knowledge of what went on ""down town"" was of the mostelementary kind, but her husband's face was the barometer in which shehad long been accustomed to read the leave to go on unrestrictedly,or the warning to pause and abstain till the coming storm should beweathered.He shook his head."
11297,5,"""N--no."
11298,5,"Nothing worse than what I can see to, if youand Undine will go steady for a while."" He paused and looked across theroom at his daughter's door."
11299,5,"""Where is she--out?""""I guess she's in her room, going over her dresses with that Frenchmaid."
11300,5,"I don't know as she's got anything fit to wear to that dinner,""Mrs."
11301,5,Spragg added in a tentative murmur.Mr.
11302,5,Spragg smiled at last.
11303,5,"""Well--I guess she WILL have,"" he saidprophetically.He glanced again at his daughter's door, as if to make sure of its beingshut; then, standing close before his wife, he lowered his voice to say:""I saw Elmer Moffatt down town to-day.""""Oh, Abner!"" A wave of almost physical apprehension passed over Mrs.Spragg."
11304,5,"Her jewelled hands trembled in her black brocade lap, and thepulpy curves of her face collapsed as if it were a pricked balloon.""Oh, Abner,"" she moaned again, her eyes also on her daughter's door."
11305,5,"Mr.Spragg's black eyebrows gathered in an angry frown, but it was evidentthat his anger was not against his wife.""What's the good of Oh Abner-ing? Elmer Moffatt's nothing to us--nomore'n if we never laid eyes on him.""""No--I know it; but what's he doing here? Did you speak to him?"" shefaltered.He slipped his thumbs into his waistcoat pockets."
11306,5,"""No--I guess Elmer andI are pretty well talked out.""Mrs."
11307,5,Spragg took up her moan.
11308,5,"""Don't you tell her you saw him, Abner.""""I'll do as you say; but she may meet him herself.""""Oh, I guess not--not in this new set she's going with! Don't tell herANYHOW.""He turned away, feeling for one of the cigars which he always carriedloose in his pocket; and his wife, rising, stole after him, and laid herhand on his arm.""He can't do anything to her, can he?""""Do anything to her?"" He swung about furiously."
11309,5,"""I'd like to see himtouch her--that's all!""IIUndine's white and gold bedroom, with sea-green panels and old rosecarpet, looked along Seventy-second Street toward the leafless tree-topsof the Central Park.She went to the window, and drawing back its many layers of lace gazedeastward down the long brownstone perspective."
11310,5,"Beyond the Park lay FifthAvenue--and Fifth Avenue was where she wanted to be!She turned back into the room, and going to her writing-table laid Mrs.Fairford's note before her, and began to study it minutely."
11311,5,"She hadread in the ""Boudoir Chat"" of one of the Sunday papers that the smartestwomen were using the new pigeon-blood notepaper with white ink; andrather against her mother's advice she had ordered a large supply, withher monogram in silver."
11312,5,"It was a disappointment, therefore, to find thatMrs."
11313,5,"Fairford wrote on the old-fashioned white sheet, without even amonogram--simply her address and telephone number."
11314,5,It gave Undine rathera poor opinion of Mrs.
11315,5,"Fairford's social standing, and for a momentshe thought with considerable satisfaction of answering the note onher pigeon-blood paper."
11316,5,Then she remembered Mrs.
11317,5,Heeny's emphaticcommendation of Mrs.
11318,5,"Fairford, and her pen wavered."
11319,5,"What if white paperwere really newer than pigeon blood? It might be more stylish, anyhow.Well, she didn't care if Mrs."
11320,5,Fairford didn't like red paper--SHE did!And she wasn't going to truckle to any woman who lived in a small housedown beyond Park Avenue...Undine was fiercely independent and yet passionately imitative.
11321,5,"Shewanted to surprise every one by her dash and originality, but she couldnot help modelling herself on the last person she met, and the confusionof ideals thus produced caused her much perturbation when she had tochoose between two courses."
11322,5,"She hesitated a moment longer, and then tookfrom the drawer a plain sheet with the hotel address.It was amusing to write the note in her mother's name--she giggled asshe formed the phrase ""I shall be happy to permit my daughter to takedinner with you"" (""take dinner"" seemed more elegant than Mrs."
11323,5,"Fairford's""dine"")--but when she came to the signature she was met by a newdifficulty."
11324,5,Mrs.
11325,5,"Fairford had signed herself ""Laura Fairford""--just asone school-girl would write to another."
11326,5,But could this be a proper modelfor Mrs.
11327,5,"Spragg? Undine could not tolerate the thought of her mother'sabasing herself to a denizen of regions beyond Park Avenue, and sheresolutely formed the signature: ""Sincerely, Mrs."
11328,5,Abner E.
11329,5,"Spragg.""Then uncertainty overcame her, and she re-wrote her note and copied Mrs.Fairford's formula: ""Yours sincerely, Leota B."
11330,5,"Spragg."" But this struckher as an odd juxtaposition of formality and freedom, and she made athird attempt: ""Yours with love, Leota B."
11331,5,"Spragg."" This, however,seemed excessive, as the ladies had never met; and after several otherexperiments she finally decided on a compromise, and ended the note:""Yours sincerely, Mrs."
11332,5,Leota B.
11333,5,"Spragg."" That might be conventional.Undine reflected, but it was certainly correct."
11334,5,"This point settled, sheflung open her door, calling imperiously down the passage: ""Celeste!""and adding, as the French maid appeared: ""I want to look over all mydinner-dresses.""Considering the extent of Miss Spragg's wardrobe her dinner-dresses werenot many."
11335,5,"She had ordered a number the year before but, vexed at herlack of use for them, had tossed them over impatiently to the maid.Since then, indeed, she and Mrs."
11336,5,"Spragg had succumbed to the abstractpleasure of buying two or three more, simply because they were tooexquisite and Undine looked too lovely in them; but she had grown tiredof these also--tired of seeing them hang unworn in her wardrobe, like somany derisive points of interrogation."
11337,5,"And now, as Celeste spread themout on the bed, they seemed disgustingly common-place, and as familiaras if she had danced them to shreds."
11338,5,"Nevertheless, she yielded to themaid's persuasions and tried them on.The first and second did not gain by prolonged inspection: they lookedold-fashioned already."
11339,5,"""It's something about the sleeves,"" Undinegrumbled as she threw them aside.The third was certainly the prettiest; but then it was the one shehad worn at the hotel dance the night before and the impossibility ofwearing it again within the week was too obvious for discussion."
11340,5,"Yet sheenjoyed looking at herself in it, for it reminded her of her sparklingpassages with Claud Walsingham Popple, and her quieter but more fruitfultalk with his little friend--the young man she had hardly noticed.""You can go, Celeste--I'll take off the dress myself,"" she said: andwhen Celeste had passed out, laden with discarded finery."
11341,5,"Undine boltedher door, dragged the tall pier-glass forward and, rummaging in a drawerfor fan and gloves, swept to a seat before the mirror with the air ofa lady arriving at an evening party."
11342,5,"Celeste, before leaving, had drawndown the blinds and turned on the electric light, and the white and goldroom, with its blazing wall-brackets, formed a sufficiently brilliantbackground to carry out the illusion."
11343,5,"So untempered a glare would havebeen destructive to all half-tones and subtleties of modelling; butUndine's beauty was as vivid, and almost as crude, as the brightnesssuffusing it."
11344,5,"Her black brows, her reddish-tawny hair and the pure redand white of her complexion defied the searching decomposing radiance:she might have been some fabled creature whose home was in a beam oflight.Undine, as a child, had taken but a lukewarm interest in the diversionsof her playmates."
11345,5,"Even in the early days when she had lived with herparents in a ragged outskirt of Apex, and hung on the fence with IndianaFrusk, the freckled daughter of the plumber ""across the way,"" she hadcared little for dolls or skipping-ropes, and still less for the riotousgames in which the loud Indiana played Atalanta to all the boyhood ofthe quarter."
11346,5,"Already Undine's chief delight was to ""dress up"" in hermother's Sunday skirt and ""play lady"" before the wardrobe mirror."
11347,5,"Thetaste had outlasted childhood, and she still practised the same secretpantomime, gliding in, settling her skirts, swaying her fan, movingher lips in soundless talk and laughter; but lately she had shrunkfrom everything that reminded her of her baffled social yearnings."
11348,5,"Now,however, she could yield without afterthought to the joy of dramatizingher beauty."
11349,5,Within a few days she would be enacting the scene she wasnow mimicking; and it amused her to see in advance just what impressionshe would produce on Mrs.
11350,5,"Fairford's guests.For a while she carried on her chat with an imaginary circle ofadmirers, twisting this way and that, fanning, fidgeting, twitching ather draperies, as she did in real life when people were noticing her.Her incessant movements were not the result of shyness: she thought itthe correct thing to be animated in society, and noise and restlessnesswere her only notion of vivacity."
11351,5,"She therefore watched herselfapprovingly, admiring the light on her hair, the flash of teeth betweenher smiling lips, the pure shadows of her throat and shoulders as shepassed from one attitude to another."
11352,5,Only one fact disturbed her: therewas a hint of too much fulness in the curves of her neck and in thespring of her hips.
11353,5,"She was tall enough to carry off a little extraweight, but excessive slimness was the fashion, and she shuddered at thethought that she might some day deviate from the perpendicular.Presently she ceased to twist and sparkle at her image, and sinking intoher chair gave herself up to retrospection."
11354,5,"She was vexed, in lookingback, to think how little notice she had taken of young Marvell, whoturned out to be so much less negligible than his brilliant friend.She remembered thinking him rather shy, less accustomed to society; andthough in his quiet deprecating way he had said one or two droll thingshe lacked Mr."
11355,5,"Popple's masterly manner, his domineering yet caressingaddress."
11356,5,When Mr.
11357,5,"Popple had fixed his black eyes on Undine, andmurmured something ""artistic"" about the colour of her hair, she hadthrilled to the depths of her being."
11358,5,"Even now it seemed incredible thathe should not turn out to be more distinguished than young Marvell: heseemed so much more in the key of the world she read about in the Sundaypapers--the dazzling auriferous world of the Van Degens, the Driscollsand their peers.She was roused by the sound in the hall of her mother's last words toMrs."
11359,5,Heeny.
11360,5,"Undine waited till their adieux were over; then, opening herdoor, she seized the astonished masseuse and dragged her into the room.Mrs."
11361,5,"Heeny gazed in admiration at the luminous apparition in whose holdshe found herself.""Mercy, Undine--you do look stunning! Are you trying on your dress forMrs."
11362,5,"Fairford's?""""Yes--no--this is only an old thing."" The girl's eyes glittered undertheir black brows."
11363,5,"""Mrs."
11364,5,"Heeny, you've got to tell me the truth--AREthey as swell as you said?""""Who? The Fairfords and Marvells? If they ain't swell enough for you.Undine Spragg, you'd better go right over to the court of England!""Undine straightened herself."
11365,5,"""I want the best."
11366,5,"Are they as swell as theDriscolls and Van Degens?""Mrs."
11367,5,Heeny sounded a scornful laugh.
11368,5,"""Look at here, now, you unbelievinggirl! As sure as I'm standing here before you, I've seen Mrs."
11369,5,"Harmon B.Driscoll of Fifth Avenue laying in her pink velvet bed with Honiton lacesheets on it, and crying her eyes out because she couldn't get askedto one of Mrs."
11370,5,Paul Marvell's musicals.
11371,5,"She'd never 'a dreamt of beingasked to a dinner there! Not all of her money couldn't 'a bought herthat--and she knows it!""Undine stood for a moment with bright cheeks and parted lips; then sheflung her soft arms about the masseuse."
11372,5,"""Oh Mrs."
11373,5,"Heeny--you're lovelyto me!"" she breathed, her lips on Mrs."
11374,5,"Heeny's rusty veil; while thelatter, freeing herself with a good-natured laugh, said as she turnedaway: ""Go steady."
11375,5,"Undine, and you'll get anywheres.""GO STEADY, UNDINE! Yes, that was the advice she needed."
11376,5,"Sometimes, inher dark moods, she blamed her parents for not having given it to her.She was so young..."
11377,5,and they had told her so little! As she looked backshe shuddered at some of her escapes.
11378,5,"Even since they had come to NewYork she had been on the verge of one or two perilous adventures, andthere had been a moment during their first winter when she had actuallyengaged herself to the handsome Austrian riding-master who accompaniedher in the Park."
11379,5,"He had carelessly shown her a card-case with a coronet,and had confided in her that he had been forced to resign from a crackcavalry regiment for fighting a duel about a Countess; and as a resultof these confidences she had pledged herself to him, and bestowed on himher pink pearl ring in exchange for one of twisted silver, which hesaid the Countess had given him on her deathbed with the request thathe should never take it off till he met a woman more beautiful thanherself.Soon afterward, luckily."
11380,5,"Undine had run across Mabel Lipscomb, whomshe had known at a middle western boarding-school as Mabel Blitch."
11381,5,"MissBlitch occupied a position of distinction as the only New York girl atthe school, and for a time there had been sharp rivalry for herfavour between Undine and Indiana Frusk, whose parents had somehowcontrived--for one term--to obtain her admission to the sameestablishment."
11382,5,"In spite of Indiana's unscrupulous methods, and of acertain violent way she had of capturing attention, the victory remainedwith Undine, whom Mabel pronounced more refined; and the discomfitedIndiana, denouncing her schoolmates as a ""bunch of mushes,"" haddisappeared forever from the scene of her defeat.Since then Mabel had returned to New York and married a stock-broker;and Undine's first steps in social enlightenment dated from the day whenshe had met Mrs."
11383,5,"Harry Lipscomb, and been again taken under her wing.Harry Lipscomb had insisted on investigating the riding-master's record,and had found that his real name was Aaronson, and that he had leftCracow under a charge of swindling servant-girls out of their savings;in the light of which discoveries Undine noticed for the first time thathis lips were too red and that his hair was pommaded."
11384,5,"That was one ofthe episodes that sickened her as she looked back, and made her resolveonce more to trust less to her impulses--especially in the matter ofgiving away rings."
11385,5,"In the interval, however, she felt she had learned agood deal, especially since, by Mabel Lipscomb's advice, the Spraggs hadmoved to the Stentorian, where that lady was herself established.There was nothing of the monopolist about Mabel, and she lost no time inmaking Undine free of the Stentorian group and its affiliated branches:a society addicted to ""days,"" and linked together by membership incountless clubs, mundane, cultural or ""earnest."" Mabel took Undine tothe days, and introduced her as a ""guest"" to the club-meetings, whereshe was supported by the presence of many other guests--""my friend MissStager, of Phalanx, Georgia,"" or (if the lady were literary) simply ""myfriend Ora Prance Chettle of Nebraska--you know what Mrs."
11386,5,"Chettle standsfor.""Some of these reunions took place in the lofty hotels moored like asonorously named fleet of battle-ships along the upper reaches of theWest Side: the Olympian, the Incandescent, the Ormolu; while others,perhaps the more exclusive, were held in the equally lofty but moreromantically styled apartment-houses: the Parthenon, the Tintern Abbeyor the Lido.Undine's preference was for the worldly parties, at which games wereplayed, and she returned home laden with prizes in Dutch silver; butshe was duly impressed by the debating clubs, where ladies of localdistinction addressed the company from an improvised platform, or themembers argued on subjects of such imperishable interest as: ""What ischarm?"" or ""The Problem-Novel"" after which pink lemonade and rainbowsandwiches were consumed amid heated discussion of the ""ethical aspect""of the question.It was all very novel and interesting, and at first Undine envied MabelLipscomb for having made herself a place in such circles; but in timeshe began to despise her for being content to remain there."
11387,5,"For it didnot take Undine long to learn that introduction to Mabel's ""set"" hadbrought her no nearer to Fifth Avenue."
11388,5,"Even in Apex, Undine's tenderimagination had been nurtured on the feats and gestures of FifthAvenue."
11389,5,"She knew all of New York's golden aristocracy by name, and thelineaments of its most distinguished scions had been made familiar bypassionate poring over the daily press."
11390,5,"In Mabel's world she soughtin vain for the originals, and only now and then caught a tantalizingglimpse of one of their familiars: as when Claud Walsingham Popple,engaged on the portrait of a lady whom the Lipscombs described as ""thewife of a Steel Magnet,"" felt it his duty to attend one of his client'steas, where it became Mabel's privilege to make his acquaintance and toname to him her friend Miss Spragg.Unsuspected social gradations were thus revealed to the attentiveUndine, but she was beginning to think that her sad proficiency had beenacquired in vain when her hopes were revived by the appearance of Mr.Popple and his friend at the Stentorian dance."
11391,5,She thought she hadlearned enough to be safe from any risk of repeating the hideousAaronson mistake; yet she now saw she had blundered again indistinguishing Claud Walsingham Popple while she almost snubbed his moreretiring companion.
11392,5,"It was all very puzzling, and her perplexity hadbeen farther increased by Mrs."
11393,5,Heeny's tale of the great Mrs.
11394,5,Harmon B.Driscoll's despair.Hitherto Undine had imagined that the Driscoll and Van Degen clans andtheir allies held undisputed suzerainty over New York society.
11395,5,"MabelLipscomb thought so too, and was given to bragging of her acquaintancewith a Mrs."
11396,5,"Spoff, who was merely a second cousin of Mrs."
11397,5,HarmonB.
11398,5,Driscoll's.
11399,5,Yet here was she.
11400,5,"Undine Spragg of Apex, about to beintroduced into an inner circle to which Driscolls and Van Degens hadlaid siege in vain! It was enough to make her feel a little dizzy withher triumph--to work her up into that state of perilous self-confidencein which all her worst follies had been committed.She stood up and, going close to the glass, examined the reflectionof her bright eyes and glowing cheeks."
11401,5,"This time her fears weresuperfluous: there were to be no more mistakes and no more follies now!She was going to know the right people at last--she was going to getwhat she wanted!As she stood there, smiling at her happy image, she heard her father'svoice in the room beyond, and instantly began to tear off her dress,strip the long gloves from her arms and unpin the rose in her hair.Tossing the fallen finery aside, she slipped on a dressing-gown andopened the door into the drawing-room.Mr."
11402,5,"Spragg was standing near her mother, who sat in a drooping attitude,her head sunk on her breast, as she did when she had one of her ""turns.""He looked up abruptly as Undine entered.""Father--has mother told you? Mrs."
11403,5,Fairford has asked me to dine.
11404,5,She'sMrs.
11405,5,Paul Marvell's daughter--Mrs.
11406,5,"Marvell was a Dagonet--and they'resweller than anybody; they WON'T KNOW the Driscolls and Van Degens!""Mr."
11407,5,"Spragg surveyed her with humorous fondness.""That so? What do they want to know you for, I wonder?"" he jeered.""Can't imagine--unless they think I'll introduce YOU!"" she jeered backin the same key, her arms around his stooping shoulders, her shininghair against his cheek.""Well--and are you going to? Have you accepted?"" he took up her joke asshe held him pinioned; while Mrs."
11408,5,"Spragg, behind them, stirred in herseat with a little moan.Undine threw back her head, plunging her eyes in his, and pressing soclose that to his tired elderly sight her face was a mere bright blur.""I want to awfully,"" she declared, ""but I haven't got a single thing towear.""Mrs."
11409,5,"Spragg, at this, moaned more audibly."
11410,5,"""Undine, I wouldn't askfather to buy any more clothes right on top of those last bills.""""I ain't on top of those last bills yet--I'm way down under them,"" Mr.Spragg interrupted, raising his hands to imprison his daughter's slenderwrists.""Oh, well--if you want me to look like a scarecrow, and not get askedagain, I've got a dress that'll do PERFECTLY,"" Undine threatened, in atone between banter and vexation.Mr."
11411,5,"Spragg held her away at arm's length, a smile drawing up the loosewrinkles about his eyes.""Well, that kind of dress might come in mighty handy on SOME occasions;so I guess you'd better hold on to it for future use, and go and selectanother for this Fairford dinner,"" he said; and before he could finishhe was in her arms again, and she was smothering his last word in littlecries and kisses.IIIThough she would not for the world have owned it to her parents, Undinewas disappointed in the Fairford dinner.The house, to begin with, was small and rather shabby."
11412,5,"There was nogilding, no lavish diffusion of light: the room they sat in afterdinner, with its green-shaded lamps making faint pools of brightness,and its rows of books from floor to ceiling, reminded Undine of the oldcirculating library at Apex, before the new marble building was putup."
11413,5,"Then, instead of a gas-log, or a polished grate with electric bulbsbehind ruby glass, there was an old-fashioned wood-fire, like picturesof ""Back to the farm for Christmas""; and when the logs fell forward Mrs.Pairford or her brother had to jump up to push them in place, and theashes scattered over the hearth untidily.The dinner too was disappointing."
11414,5,"Undine was too young to take note ofculinary details, but she had expected to view the company through abower of orchids and eat pretty-coloured entrees in ruffled papers.Instead, there was only a low centre-dish of ferns, and plain roastedand broiled meat that one could recognize--as if they'd been dyspepticson a diet! With all the hints in the Sunday papers, she thought itdull of Mrs."
11415,5,"Fairford not to have picked up something newer; and as theevening progressed she began to suspect that it wasn't a real ""dinnerparty,"" and that they had just asked her in to share what they had whenthey were alone.But a glance about the table convinced her that Mrs."
11416,5,Fairford could nothave meant to treat her other guests so lightly.
11417,5,"They were only eightin number, but one was no less a person than young Mrs."
11418,5,"Peter VanDegen--the one who had been a Dagonet--and the consideration which thisyoung lady, herself one of the choicest ornaments of the Society Column,displayed toward the rest of the company, convinced Undine that theymust be more important than they looked."
11419,5,She liked Mrs.
11420,5,"Fairford,a small incisive woman, with a big nose and good teeth revealed byfrequent smiles."
11421,5,"In her dowdy black and antiquated ornaments she was notwhat Undine would have called ""stylish""; but she had a droll kind waywhich reminded the girl of her father's manner when he was not tired orworried about money."
11422,5,"One of the other ladies, having white hair, did notlong arrest Undine's attention; and the fourth, a girl like herself, whowas introduced as Miss Harriet Ray, she dismissed at a glance as plainand wearing a last year's ""model.""The men, too, were less striking than she had hoped."
11423,5,She had notexpected much of Mr.
11424,5,"Fairford, since married men were intrinsicallyuninteresting, and his baldness and grey moustache seemed naturally torelegate him to the background; but she had looked for some brilliantyouths of her own age--in her inmost heart she had looked for Mr.Popple."
11425,5,"He was not there, however, and of the other men one, whomthey called Mr."
11426,5,"Bowen, was hopelessly elderly--she supposed he was thehusband of the white-haired lady--and the other two, who seemed to befriends of young Marvell's, were both lacking in Claud Walsingham'sdash.Undine sat between Mr."
11427,5,"Bowen and young Marvell, who struck her as very""sweet"" (it was her word for friendliness), but even shyer than at thehotel dance."
11428,5,"Yet she was not sure if he were shy, or if his quietnesswere only a new kind of self-possession which expressed itselfnegatively instead of aggressively."
11429,5,"Small, well-knit, fair, he satstroking his slight blond moustache and looking at her with kindly,almost tender eyes; but he left it to his sister and the others to drawher out and fit her into the pattern.Mrs."
11430,5,Fairford talked so well that the girl wondered why Mrs.
11431,5,Heeny hadfound her lacking in conversation.
11432,5,But though Undine thought silentpeople awkward she was not easily impressed by verbal fluency.
11433,5,All theladies in Apex City were more voluble than Mrs.
11434,5,"Fairford, and hada larger vocabulary: the difference was that with Mrs."
11435,5,Fairfordconversation seemed to be a concert and not a solo.
11436,5,"She kept drawing inthe others, giving each a turn, beating time for them with her smile,and somehow harmonizing and linking together what they said."
11437,5,"She tookparticular pains to give Undine her due part in the performance; butthe girl's expansive impulses were always balanced by odd reactionsof mistrust, and to-night the latter prevailed."
11438,5,"She meant to watch andlisten without letting herself go, and she sat very straight and pink,answering promptly but briefly, with the nervous laugh that punctuatedall her phrases--saying ""I don't care if I do"" when her host asked herto try some grapes, and ""I wouldn't wonder"" when she thought any one wastrying to astonish her.This state of lucidity enabled her to take note of all that was beingsaid."
11439,5,"The talk ran more on general questions, and less on people, thanshe was used to; but though the allusions to pictures and books escapedher, she caught and stored up every personal reference, and the pink inher cheeks deepened at a random mention of Mr."
11440,5,"Popple.""Yes--he's doing me,"" Mrs."
11441,5,"Peter Van Degen was saying, in her slightlydrawling voice."
11442,5,"""He's doing everybody this year, you know--""""As if that were a reason!"" Undine heard Mrs."
11443,5,"Fairford breathe to Mr.Bowen; who replied, at the same pitch: ""It's a Van Degen reason, isn'tit?""--to which Mrs."
11444,5,"Fairford shrugged assentingly.""That delightful Popple--he paints so exactly as he talks!"" thewhite-haired lady took it up."
11445,5,"""All his portraits seem to proclaim whata gentleman he is, and how he fascinates women! They're not pictures ofMrs."
11446,5,"or Miss So-and-so, but simply of the impression Popple thinks he'smade on them.""Mrs."
11447,5,Fairford smiled.
11448,5,"""I've sometimes thought,"" she mused, ""that Mr.Popple must be the only gentleman I know; at least he's the only manwho has ever told me he was a gentleman--and Mr."
11449,5,"Popple never fails tomention it.""Undine's ear was too well attuned to the national note of irony for hernot to perceive that her companions were making sport of the painter.She winced at their banter as if it had been at her own expense, yetit gave her a dizzy sense of being at last in the very stronghold offashion."
11450,5,Her attention was diverted by hearing Mrs.
11451,5,"Van Degen, undercover of the general laugh, say in a low tone to young Marvell: ""Ithought you liked his things, or I wouldn't have had him paint me.""Something in her tone made all Undine's perceptions bristle, and shestrained her ears for the answer.""I think he'll do you capitally--you must let me come and see some daysoon."" Marvell's tone was always so light, so unemphasized, that shecould not be sure of its being as indifferent as it sounded."
11452,5,She lookeddown at the fruit on her plate and shot a side-glance through her lashesat Mrs.
11453,5,Peter Van Degen.Mrs.
11454,5,Van Degen was neither beautiful nor imposing: just a darkgirlish-looking creature with plaintive eyes and a fidgety frequentlaugh.
11455,5,"But she was more elaborately dressed and jewelled than the otherladies, and her elegance and her restlessness made her seem lessalien to Undine."
11456,5,"She had turned on Marvell a gaze at once pleading andpossessive; but whether betokening merely an inherited intimacy (Undinehad noticed that they were all more or less cousins) or a more personalfeeling, her observer was unable to decide; just as the tone ofthe young man's reply might have expressed the open avowal ofgood-fellowship or the disguise of a different sentiment."
11457,5,"All wasblurred and puzzling to the girl in this world of half-lights,half-tones, eliminations and abbreviations; and she felt a violentlonging to brush away the cobwebs and assert herself as the dominantfigure of the scene.Yet in the drawing-room, with the ladies, where Mrs."
11458,5,"Fairford came andsat by her, the spirit of caution once more prevailed."
11459,5,"She wanted to benoticed but she dreaded to be patronized, and here again her hostess'sgradations of tone were confusing."
11460,5,Mrs.
11461,5,"Fairford made no tactlessallusions to her being a newcomer in New York--there was nothing asbitter to the girl as that--but her questions as to what pictures hadinterested Undine at the various exhibitions of the moment, and which ofthe new books she had read, were almost as open to suspicion, since theyhad to be answered in the negative."
11462,5,"Undine did not even know that therewere any pictures to be seen, much less that ""people"" went to see them;and she had read no new book but ""When The Kissing Had to Stop,"" ofwhich Mrs."
11463,5,Fairford seemed not to have heard.
11464,5,"On the theatre they wereequally at odds, for while Undine had seen ""Oolaloo"" fourteen times, andwas ""wild"" about Ned Norris in ""The Soda-Water Fountain,"" she had notheard of the famous Berlin comedians who were performing Shakespeare atthe German Theatre, and knew only by name the clever American actresswho was trying to give ""repertory"" plays with a good stock company."
11465,5,"Theconversation was revived for a moment by her recalling that she had seenSarah Bernhard in a play she called ""Leg-long,"" and another which shepronounced ""Fade""; but even this did not carry them far, as she hadforgotten what both plays were about and had found the actress a gooddeal older than she expected.Matters were not improved by the return of the men from thesmoking-room."
11466,5,"Henley Fairford replaced his wife at Undine's side; andsince it was unheard-of at Apex for a married man to force his societyon a young girl, she inferred that the others didn't care to talk toher, and that her host and hostess were in league to take her off theirhands."
11467,5,"This discovery resulted in her holding her vivid head very high,and answering ""I couldn't really say,"" or ""Is that so?"" to all Mr.Fairford's ventures; and as these were neither numerous nor striking itwas a relief to both when the rising of the elderly lady gave the signalfor departure.In the hall, where young Marvell had managed to precede her."
11468,5,Undinefound Mrs.
11469,5,Van Degen putting on her cloak.
11470,5,"As she gathered it about hershe laid her hand on Marvell's arm.""Ralphie, dear, you'll come to the opera with me on Friday? We'll dinetogether first--Peter's got a club dinner."" They exchanged what seemed asmile of intelligence, and Undine heard the young man accept."
11471,5,"Then Mrs.Van Degen turned to her.""Good-bye, Miss Spragg."
11472,5,"I hope you'll come--""""--TO DINE WITH ME TOO?"" That must be what she was going to say, andUndine's heart gave a bound.""--to see me some afternoon,"" Mrs."
11473,5,"Van Degen ended, going down the stepsto her motor, at the door of which a much-furred footman waited withmore furs on his arm.Undine's face burned as she turned to receive her cloak."
11474,5,"When she haddrawn it on with haughty deliberation she found Marvell at her side,in hat and overcoat, and her heart gave a higher bound."
11475,5,"He was going to""escort"" her home, of course! This brilliant youth--she felt now that heWAS brilliant--who dined alone with married women, whom the ""Van Degenset"" called ""Ralphie, dear,"" had really no eyes for any one but herself;and at the thought her lost self-complacency flowed back warm throughher veins.The street was coated with ice, and she had a delicious momentdescending the steps on Marvell's arm, and holding it fast while theywaited for her cab to come up; but when he had helped her in he closedthe door and held his hand out over the lowered window.""Good-bye,"" he said, smiling; and she could not help the break of pridein her voice, as she faltered out stupidly, from the depths of herdisillusionment: ""Oh--good-bye.""IV""Father, you've got to take a box for me at the opera next Friday.""From the tone of her voice Undine's parents knew at once that she was""nervous.""They had counted a great deal on the Fairford dinner as a means oftranquillization, and it was a blow to detect signs of the oppositeresult when, late the next morning, their daughter came dawdling intothe sodden splendour of the Stentorian breakfast-room.The symptoms of Undine's nervousness were unmistakable to Mr."
11476,5,and Mrs.Spragg.
11477,5,"They could read the approaching storm in the darkening of hereyes from limpid grey to slate-colour, and in the way her straightblack brows met above them and the red curves of her lips narrowed to aparallel line below.Mr."
11478,5,"Spragg, having finished the last course of his heterogeneous meal,was adjusting his gold eye-glasses for a glance at the paper whenUndine trailed down the sumptuous stuffy room, where coffee-fumes hungperpetually under the emblazoned ceiling and the spongy carpet mighthave absorbed a year's crumbs without a sweeping.About them sat other pallid families, richly dressed, and silentlyeating their way through a bill-of-fare which seemed to have ransackedthe globe for gastronomic incompatibilities; and in the middle of theroom a knot of equally pallid waiters, engaged in languid conversation,turned their backs by common consent on the persons they were supposedto serve.Undine, who rose too late to share the family breakfast, usually had herchocolate brought to her in bed by Celeste, after the manner describedin the articles on ""A Society Woman's Day"" which were appearing inBoudoir Chat."
11479,5,"Her mere appearance in the restaurant therefore preparedher parents for those symptoms of excessive tension which a nearerinspection confirmed, and Mr."
11480,5,"Spragg folded his paper and hooked hisglasses to his waistcoat with the air of a man who prefers to know theworst and have it over.""An opera box!"" faltered Mrs."
11481,5,"Spragg, pushing aside the bananas andcream with which she had been trying to tempt an appetite too languidfor fried liver or crab mayonnaise.""A parterre box,"" Undine corrected, ignoring the exclamation, andcontinuing to address herself to her father."
11482,5,"""Friday's the stylishnight, and that new tenor's going to sing again in 'Cavaleeria,'"" shecondescended to explain.""That so?"" Mr."
11483,5,"Spragg thrust his hands into his waistcoat pockets, andbegan to tilt his chair till he remembered there was no wall to meet it.He regained his balance and said: ""Wouldn't a couple of good orchestraseats do you?""""No; they wouldn't,"" Undine answered with a darkening brow."
11484,5,He looked ather humorously.
11485,5,"""You invited the whole dinner-party, I suppose?""""No--no one.""""Going all alone in a box?"" She was disdainfully silent."
11486,5,"""I don't s'poseyou're thinking of taking mother and me?""This was so obviously comic that they all laughed--even Mrs."
11487,5,"Spragg--andUndine went on more mildly: ""I want to do something for Mabel Lipscomb:make some return."
11488,5,"She's always taking me 'round, and I've never done athing for her--not a single thing.""This appeal to the national belief in the duty of reciprocal ""treating""could not fail of its effect, and Mrs."
11489,5,"Spragg murmured: ""She never HAS,Abner,""--but Mr."
11490,5,"Spragg's brow remained unrelenting.""Do you know what a box costs?""""No; but I s'pose you do,"" Undine returned with unconscious flippancy.""I do."
11491,5,That's the trouble.
11492,5,"WHY won't seats do you?""""Mabel could buy seats for herself.""""That's so,"" interpolated Mrs."
11493,5,"Spragg--always the first to succumb toher daughter's arguments.""Well, I guess I can't buy a box for her.""Undine's face gloomed more deeply."
11494,5,"She sat silent, her chocolatethickening in the cup, while one hand, almost as much beringed as hermother's, drummed on the crumpled table-cloth.""We might as well go straight back to Apex,"" she breathed at lastbetween her teeth.Mrs."
11495,5,Spragg cast a frightened glance at her husband.
11496,5,"These strugglesbetween two resolute wills always brought on her palpitations, and shewished she had her phial of digitalis with her.""A parterre box costs a hundred and twenty-five dollars a night,"" saidMr."
11497,5,"Spragg, transferring a toothpick to his waistcoat pocket.""I only want it once.""He looked at her with a quizzical puckering of his crows'-feet."
11498,5,"""Youonly want most things once."
11499,5,"Undine.""It was an observation they had made in her earliest youth--Undine neverwanted anything long, but she wanted it ""right off."" And until she gotit the house was uninhabitable.""I'd a good deal rather have a box for the season,"" she rejoined, and hesaw the opening he had given her."
11500,5,"She had two ways of getting thingsout of him against his principles; the tender wheedling way, and theharsh-lipped and cold--and he did not know which he dreaded most."
11501,5,"As achild they had admired her assertiveness, had made Apex ring withtheir boasts of it; but it had long since cowed Mrs."
11502,5,"Spragg, and it wasbeginning to frighten her husband.""Fact is, Undie,"" he said, weakening, ""I'm a little mite strapped justthis month.""Her eyes grew absent-minded, as they always did when he alluded tobusiness."
11503,5,"THAT was man's province; and what did men go ""down town"" forbut to bring back the spoils to their women? She rose abruptly, leavingher parents seated, and said, more to herself than the others: ""ThinkI'll go for a ride.""""Oh, Undine!"" fluttered Mrs."
11504,5,Spragg.
11505,5,"She always had palpitations whenUndine rode, and since the Aaronson episode her fears were not confinedto what the horse might do.""Why don't you take your mother out shopping a little?"" Mr."
11506,5,"Spraggsuggested, conscious of the limitation of his resources.Undine made no answer, but swept down the room, and out of the doorahead of her mother, with scorn and anger in every line of her arrogantyoung back."
11507,5,Mrs.
11508,5,"Spragg tottered meekly after her, and Mr."
11509,5,"Spragglounged out into the marble hall to buy a cigar before taking the Subwayto his office.Undine went for a ride, not because she felt particularly disposed forthe exercise, but because she wished to discipline her mother."
11510,5,"She wasalmost sure she would get her opera box, but she did not see why sheshould have to struggle for her rights, and she was especially annoyedwith Mrs."
11511,5,Spragg for seconding her so half-heartedly.
11512,5,"If she and hermother did not hold together in such crises she would have twice thework to do.Undine hated ""scenes"": she was essentially peace-loving, and would havepreferred to live on terms of unbroken harmony with her parents."
11513,5,Butshe could not help it if they were unreasonable.
11514,5,"Ever since she couldremember there had been ""fusses"" about money; yet she and her mother hadalways got what they wanted, apparently without lasting detriment to thefamily fortunes."
11515,5,"It was therefore natural to conclude that there wereample funds to draw upon, and that Mr."
11516,5,Spragg's occasional resistanceswere merely due to an imperfect understanding of what constituted thenecessities of life.When she returned from her ride Mrs.
11517,5,Spragg received her as if she hadcome back from the dead.
11518,5,"It was absurd, of course; but Undine was inuredto the absurdity of parents.""Has father telephoned?"" was her first brief question.""No, he hasn't yet.""Undine's lips tightened, but she proceeded deliberately with the removalof her habit.""You'd think I'd asked him to buy me the Opera House, the wayhe's acting over a single box,"" she muttered, flinging aside hersmartly-fitting coat."
11519,5,Mrs.
11520,5,Spragg received the flying garment andsmoothed it out on the bed.
11521,5,"Neither of the ladies could ""bear"" to havetheir maid about when they were at their toilet, and Mrs."
11522,5,"Spragg hadalways performed these ancillary services for Undine.""You know, Undie, father hasn't always got the money in his pocket, andthe bills have been pretty heavy lately."
11523,5,"Father was a rich man for Apex,but that's different from being rich in New York.""She stood before her daughter, looking down on her appealingly.Undine, who had seated herself while she detached her stock andwaistcoat, raised her head with an impatient jerk."
11524,5,"""Why on earth did weever leave Apex, then?"" she exclaimed.Mrs."
11525,5,"Spragg's eyes usually dropped before her daughter's inclementgaze; but on this occasion they held their own with a kind of awe-struckcourage, till Undine's lids sank above her flushing cheeks.She sprang up, tugging at the waistband of her habit, while Mrs."
11526,5,"Spragg,relapsing from temerity to meekness, hovered about her with obstructivezeal."
11527,5,"""If you'd only just let go of my skirt, mother--I can unhook ittwice as quick myself.""Mrs."
11528,5,"Spragg drew back, understanding that her presence was no longerwanted."
11529,5,"But on the threshold she paused, as if overruled by a strongerinfluence, and said, with a last look at her daughter: ""You didn't meetanybody when you were out, did you, Undie?""Undine's brows drew together: she was struggling with her longpatent-leather boot.""Meet anybody? Do you mean anybody I know? I don't KNOW anybody--I nevershall, if father can't afford to let me go round with people!""The boot was off with a wrench, and she flung it violently across theold-rose carpet, while Mrs."
11530,5,"Spragg, turning away to hide a look ofinexpressible relief, slipped discreetly from the room.The day wore on."
11531,5,"Undine had meant to go down and tell Mabel Lipscombabout the Fairford dinner, but its aftertaste was flat on her lips."
11532,5,"Whatwould it lead to? Nothing, as far as she could see."
11533,5,Ralph Marvell hadnot even asked when he might call; and she was ashamed to confess toMabel that he had not driven home with her.Suddenly she decided that she would go and see the pictures of whichMrs.
11534,5,Fairford had spoken.
11535,5,"Perhaps she might meet some of the people shehad seen at dinner--from their talk one might have imagined that theyspent their lives in picture-galleries.The thought reanimated her, and she put on her handsomest furs, and ahat for which she had not yet dared present the bill to her father."
11536,5,"Itwas the fashionable hour in Fifth Avenue, but Undine knew none of theladies who were bowing to each other from interlocked motors."
11537,5,She had tocontent herself with the gaze of admiration which she left in her wakealong the pavement; but she was used to the homage of the streets andher vanity craved a choicer fare.When she reached the art gallery which Mrs.
11538,5,"Fairford had named shefound it even more crowded than Fifth Avenue; and some of the ladiesand gentlemen wedged before the pictures had the ""look"" which signifiedsocial consecration."
11539,5,"As Undine made her way among them, she was aware ofattracting almost as much notice as in the street, and she flungherself into rapt attitudes before the canvases, scribbling notes inthe catalogue in imitation of a tall girl in sables, while ripples ofself-consciousness played up and down her watchful back.Presently her attention was drawn to a lady in black who was examiningthe pictures through a tortoise-shell eye-glass adorned with diamondsand hanging from a long pearl chain."
11540,5,Undine was instantly struck by theopportunities which this toy presented for graceful wrist movementsand supercilious turns of the head.
11541,5,"It seemed suddenly plebeian andpromiscuous to look at the world with a naked eye, and all her floatingdesires were merged in the wish for a jewelled eye-glass and chain."
11542,5,"Soviolent was this wish that, drawn on in the wake of the owner of theeye-glass, she found herself inadvertently bumping against a stouttight-coated young man whose impact knocked her catalogue from her hand.As the young man picked the catalogue up and held it out to her shenoticed that his bulging eyes and queer retreating face were suffusedwith a glow of admiration."
11543,5,He was so unpleasant-looking that she wouldhave resented his homage had not his odd physiognomy called up somevaguely agreeable association of ideas.
11544,5,"Where had she seen before thisgrotesque saurian head, with eye-lids as thick as lips and lips asthick as ear-lobes? It fled before her down a perspective of innumerablenewspaper portraits, all, like the original before her, tightly coated,with a huge pearl transfixing a silken tie....""Oh, thank you,"" she murmured, all gleams and graces, while he stood hatin hand, saying sociably:""The crowd's simply awful, isn't it?""At the same moment the lady of the eye-glass drifted closer, and with atap of her wand, and a careless ""Peter, look at this,"" swept him to theother side of the gallery.Undine's heart was beating excitedly, for as he turned away she hadidentified him."
11545,5,"Peter Van Degen--who could he be but young Peter VanDegen, the son of the great banker, Thurber Van Degen, the husband ofRalph Marvell's cousin, the hero of ""Sunday Supplements,"" the captor ofBlue Ribbons at Horse-Shows, of Gold Cups at Motor Races, the owner ofwinning race-horses and ""crack"" sloops: the supreme exponent, in short,of those crowning arts that made all life seem stale and unprofitableoutside the magic ring of the Society Column? Undine smiled as sherecalled the look with which his pale protruding eyes had rested onher--it almost consoled her for his wife's indifference!When she reached home she found that she could not remember anythingabout the pictures she had seen...There was no message from her father, and a reaction of disgust set in.Of what good were such encounters if they were to have no sequel? Shewould probably never meet Peter Van Degen again--or, if she DID runacross him in the same accidental way, she knew they could not continuetheir conversation without being ""introduced."" What was the use of beingbeautiful and attracting attention if one were perpetually doomed torelapse again into the obscure mass of the Uninvited?Her gloom was not lightened by finding Ralph Marvell's card on thedrawing-room table."
11546,5,She thought it unflattering and almost impolite ofhim to call without making an appointment: it seemed to show that hedid not wish to continue their acquaintance.
11547,5,"But as she tossed the cardaside her mother said: ""He was real sorry not to see you."
11548,5,"Undine--he sathere nearly an hour.""Undine's attention was roused."
11549,5,"""Sat here--all alone? Didn't you tell himI was out?""""Yes--but he came up all the same."
11550,5,"He asked for me.""""Asked for YOU?""The social order seemed to be falling in ruins at Undine's feet."
11551,5,Avisitor who asked for a girl's mother!--she stared at Mrs.
11552,5,Spragg withcold incredulity.
11553,5,"""What makes you think he did?""""Why, they told me so."
11554,5,"I telephoned down that you were out, and theysaid he'd asked for me."" Mrs."
11555,5,Spragg let the fact speak for itself--itwas too much out of the range of her experience to admit of even ahypothetical explanation.Undine shrugged her shoulders.
11556,5,"""It was a mistake, of course."
11557,5,"Why onearth did you let him come up?""""I thought maybe he had a message for you, Undie.""This plea struck her daughter as not without weight."
11558,5,"""Well, did he?""she asked, drawing out her hat-pins and tossing down her hat on the onyxtable.""Why, no--he just conversed."
11559,5,"He was lovely to me, but I couldn't makeout what he was after,"" Mrs."
11560,5,Spragg was obliged to own.Her daughter looked at her with a kind of chill commiseration.
11561,5,"""Younever CAN,"" she murmured, turning away.She stretched herself out moodily on one of the pink and gold sofas,and lay there brooding, an unread novel on her knee."
11562,5,Mrs.
11563,5,"Spragg timidlyslipped a cushion under her daughter's head, and then dissembled herselfbehind the lace window-curtains and sat watching the lights spring outdown the long street and spread their glittering net across the Park."
11564,5,Itwas one of Mrs.
11565,5,"Spragg's chief occupations to watch the nightly lightingof New York.Undine lay silent, her hands clasped behind her head."
11566,5,"She was plunged inone of the moods of bitter retrospection when all her past seemed like along struggle for something she could not have, from a trip to Europe toan opera-box; and when she felt sure that, as the past had been, so thefuture would be."
11567,5,"And yet, as she had often told her parents, all shesought for was improvement: she honestly wanted the best.Her first struggle--after she had ceased to scream for candy, or sulkfor a new toy--had been to get away from Apex in summer."
11568,5,"Her summers,as she looked back on them, seemed to typify all that was dreariest andmost exasperating in her life."
11569,5,"The earliest had been spent in theyellow ""frame"" cottage where she had hung on the fence, kicking hertoes against the broken palings and exchanging moist chewing-gum andhalf-eaten apples with Indiana Frusk."
11570,5,"Later on, she had returned fromher boarding-school to the comparative gentility of summer vacations atthe Mealey House, whither her parents, forsaking their squalid suburb,had moved in the first flush of their rising fortunes."
11571,5,"The tessellatedfloors, the plush parlours and organ-like radiators of the Mealey Househad, aside from their intrinsic elegance, the immense advantage oflifting the Spraggs high above the Frusks, and making it possible forUndine, when she met Indiana in the street or at school, to chill heradvances by a careless allusion to the splendours of hotel life."
11572,5,"Buteven in such a setting, and in spite of the social superiority itimplied, the long months of the middle western summer, fly-blown,torrid, exhaling stale odours, soon became as insufferable as they hadbeen in the little yellow house."
11573,5,"At school Undine met other girls whoseparents took them to the Great Lakes for August; some even went toCalifornia, others--oh bliss ineffable!--went ""east.""Pale and listless under the stifling boredom of the Mealey Houseroutine, Undine secretly sucked lemons, nibbled slate-pencils and drankpints of bitter coffee to aggravate her look of ill-health; and when shelearned that even Indiana Frusk was to go on a month's visit to Buffaloit needed no artificial aids to emphasize the ravages of envy."
11574,5,"Herparents, alarmed by her appearance, were at last convinced of thenecessity of change, and timidly, tentatively, they transferredthemselves for a month to a staring hotel on a glaring lake.There Undine enjoyed the satisfaction of sending ironic post-cards toIndiana, and discovering that she could more than hold her ownagainst the youth and beauty of the other visitors."
11575,5,"Then she made theacquaintance of a pretty woman from Richmond, whose husband, a miningengineer, had brought her west with him while he inspected thenewly developed Eubaw mines; and the southern visitor's dismay, herrepugnances, her recoil from the faces, the food, the amusements, thegeneral bareness and stridency of the scene, were a terrible initiationto Undine."
11576,5,"There was something still better beyond, then--moreluxurious, more exciting, more worthy of her! She once said to herself,afterward, that it was always her fate to find out just too late aboutthe ""something beyond."" But in this case it was not too late--andobstinately, inflexibly, she set herself to the task of forcing herparents to take her ""east"" the next summer.Yielding to the inevitable, they suffered themselves to be impelled toa Virginia ""resort,"" where Undine had her first glimpse of more romanticpossibilities--leafy moonlight rides and drives, picnics in mountainglades, and an atmosphere of Christmas-chromo sentimentality thattempered her hard edges a little, and gave her glimpses of a moredelicate kind of pleasure."
11577,5,But here again everything was spoiled by apeep through another door.
11578,5,"Undine, after a first mustering of the othergirls in the hotel, had, as usual, found herself easily first--till thearrival, from Washington, of Mr."
11579,5,and Mrs.
11580,5,"Wincher and their daughter.Undine was much handsomer than Miss Wincher, but she saw at a glancethat she did not know how to use her beauty as the other used herplainness."
11581,5,"She was exasperated too, by the discovery that Miss Wincherseemed not only unconscious of any possible rivalry between them, butactually unaware of her existence."
11582,5,"Listless, long-faced, supercilious,the young lady from Washington sat apart reading novels or playingsolitaire with her parents, as though the huge hotel's loud life ofgossip and flirtation were invisible and inaudible to her."
11583,5,Undine nevereven succeeded in catching her eye: she always lowered it to her bookwhen the Apex beauty trailed or rattled past her secluded corner.
11584,5,"Butone day an acquaintance of the Winchers' turned up--a lady from Boston,who had come to Virginia on a botanizing tour; and from scraps of MissWincher's conversation with the newcomer, Undine, straining her earsbehind a column of the long veranda, obtained a new glimpse into theunimagined.The Winchers, it appeared, found themselves at Potash Springs merelybecause a severe illness of Mrs."
11585,5,"Wincher's had made it impossible, atthe last moment, to move her farther from Washington."
11586,5,"They had let theirhouse on the North Shore, and as soon as they could leave ""this dreadfulhole"" were going to Europe for the autumn."
11587,5,Miss Wincher simply didn'tknow how she got through the days; though no doubt it was as good asa rest-cure after the rush of the winter.
11588,5,"Of course they would havepreferred to hire a house, but the ""hole,"" if one could believe it,didn't offer one; so they had simply shut themselves off as bestthey could from the ""hotel crew""--had her friend, Miss Wincherparenthetically asked, happened to notice the Sunday young men? Theywere queerer even than the ""belles"" they came for--and had escaped thepromiscuity of the dinner-hour by turning one of their rooms into adining-room, and picnicking there--with the Persimmon House standards,one couldn't describe it in any other way! But luckily the awful placewas doing mamma good, and now they had nearly served their term...Undine turned sick as she listened."
11589,5,"Only the evening before she hadgone on a ""buggy-ride"" with a young gentleman from Deposit--a dentist'sassistant--and had let him kiss her, and given him the flower from herhair."
11590,5,"She loathed the thought of him now: she loathed all the peopleabout her, and most of all the disdainful Miss Wincher."
11591,5,"It enraged herto think that the Winchers classed her with the ""hotel crew""--withthe ""belles"" who awaited their Sunday young men."
11592,5,"The place was foreverblighted for her, and the next week she dragged her amazed but thankfulparents back to Apex.But Miss Wincher's depreciatory talk had opened ampler vistas, and thepioneer blood in Undine would not let her rest."
11593,5,"She had heard the callof the Atlantic seaboard, and the next summer found the Spraggs at SkogHarbour, Maine."
11594,5,Even now Undine felt a shiver of boredom as she recalledit.
11595,5,That summer had been the worst of all.
11596,5,"The bare wind-beaten inn, allshingles without and blueberry pie within, was ""exclusive,"" parochial,Bostonian; and the Spraggs wore through the interminable weeks in blankunmitigated isolation."
11597,5,"The incomprehensible part of it was that everyother woman in the hotel was plain, dowdy or elderly--and most of themall three."
11598,5,"If there had been any competition on ordinary lines Undinewould have won, as Van Degen said, ""hands down."" But there wasn't--theother ""guests"" simply formed a cold impenetrable group who walked,boated, played golf, and discussed Christian Science and the Subliminal,unaware of the tremulous organism drifting helplessly against theirrock-bound circle.It was on the day the Spraggs left Skog Harbour that Undine vowed toherself with set lips: ""I'll never try anything again till I try NewYork."" Now she had gained her point and tried New York, and so far, itseemed, with no better success."
11599,5,"From small things to great, everythingwent against her."
11600,5,"In such hours of self-searching she was ready enoughto acknowledge her own mistakes, but they exasperated her less than theblunders of her parents."
11601,5,"She was sure, for instance, that she was onwhat Mrs."
11602,5,"Heeny called ""the right tack"" at last: yet just at themoment when her luck seemed about to turn she was to be thwarted by herfather's stupid obstinacy about the opera-box...She lay brooding over these things till long after Mrs."
11603,5,"Spragg had goneaway to dress for dinner, and it was nearly eight o'clock when she heardher father's dragging tread in the hall.She kept her eyes fixed on her book while he entered the room and movedabout behind her, laying aside his hat and overcoat; then his steps cameclose and a small parcel dropped on the pages of her book.""Oh, father!"" She sprang up, all alight, the novel on the floor, herfingers twitching for the tickets."
11604,5,"But a substantial packet emerged,like nothing she had ever seen."
11605,5,"She looked at it, hoping, fearing--shebeamed blissful interrogation on her father while his sallow smilecontinued to tantalize her."
11606,5,"Then she closed on him with a rush,smothering his words against her hair.""It's for more than one night--why, it's for every other Friday! Oh, youdarling, you darling!"" she exulted.Mr."
11607,5,"Spragg, through the glittering meshes, feigned dismay."
11608,5,"""That so?They must have given me the wrong--!"" Then, convicted by her radianteyes as she swung round on him: ""I knew you only wanted it ONCE foryourself."
11609,5,"Undine; but I thought maybe, off night."
11610,5,Selden paused in surprise.
11611,5,"In the afternoon rush of the GrandCentral Station his eyes had been refreshed by the sight of MissLily Bart.It was a Monday in early September, and he was returning to hiswork from a hurried dip into the country; but what was Miss Bartdoing in town at that season? If she had appeared to be catching atrain, he might have inferred that he had come on her in the actof transition between one and another of the country houses whichdisputed her presence after the close of the Newport season; buther desultory air perplexed him."
11612,5,"She stood apart from the crowd,letting it drift by her to the platform or the street, and wearingan air of irresolution which might, as he surmised, be the mask ofa very definite purpose."
11613,5,"It struck him at once that she was waitingfor some one, but he hardly knew why the idea arrested him."
11614,5,"Therewas nothing new about Lily Bart, yet he could never see her withouta faint movement of interest: it was characteristic of her that shealways roused speculation, that her simplest acts seemed the resultof far-reaching intentions.An impulse of curiosity made him turn out of his direct line to thedoor, and stroll past her."
11615,5,He knew that if she did not wish to beseen she would contrive to elude him; and it amused him to think ofputting her skill to the test.“Mr.
11616,5,"Selden—what good luck!”She came forward smiling, eager almost, in her resolve to intercepthim."
11617,5,"One or two persons, in brushing past them, lingered to look;for Miss Bart was a figure to arrest even the suburban travellerrushing to his last train.Selden had never seen her more radiant."
11618,5,"Her vivid head, relievedagainst the dull tints of the crowd, made her more conspicuous thanin a ball-room, and under her dark hat and veil she regained thegirlish smoothness, the purity of tint, that she was beginning tolose after eleven years of late hours and indefatigable dancing.Was it really eleven years, Selden found himself wondering, and hadshe indeed reached the nine-and-twentieth birthday with which herrivals credited her?“What luck!” she repeated."
11619,5,"“How nice of you to come to my rescue!”He responded joyfully that to do so was his mission in life, andasked what form the rescue was to take.“Oh, almost any—even to sitting on a bench and talking to me."
11620,5,Onesits out a cotillion—why not sit out a train? It isn’t a bit hotterhere than in Mrs.
11621,5,"Van Osburgh’s conservatory—and some of the womenare not a bit uglier.” She broke off, laughing, to explain that shehad come up to town from Tuxedo, on her way to the Gus Trenors’ atBellomont, and had missed the three-fifteen train to Rhinebeck.“And there isn’t another till half-past five.” She consulted thelittle jewelled watch among her laces."
11622,5,“Just two hours to wait.
11623,5,AndI don’t know what to do with myself.
11624,5,"My maid came up this morningto do some shopping for me, and was to go on to Bellomont at oneo’clock, and my aunt’s house is closed, and I don’t know a soul intown.” She glanced plaintively about the station."
11625,5,“It IS hotterthan Mrs.
11626,5,"Van Osburgh’s, after all."
11627,5,"If you can spare the time, dotake me somewhere for a breath of air.”He declared himself entirely at her disposal: the adventure struckhim as diverting."
11628,5,"As a spectator, he had always enjoyed Lily Bart;and his course lay so far out of her orbit that it amused him tobe drawn for a moment into the sudden intimacy which her proposalimplied.“Shall we go over to Sherry’s for a cup of tea?”She smiled assentingly, and then made a slight grimace.“So many people come up to town on a Monday—one is sure to meet alot of bores."
11629,5,"I’m as old as the hills, of course, and it ought notto make any difference; but if I’M old enough, you’re not,” sheobjected gaily."
11630,5,"“I’m dying for tea—but isn’t there a quieter place?”He answered her smile, which rested on him vividly."
11631,5,Her discretionsinterested him almost as much as her imprudences: he was so surethat both were part of the same carefully-elaborated plan.
11632,5,"Injudging Miss Bart, he had always made use of the “argument fromdesign.”“The resources of New York are rather meagre,” he said; “but I’llfind a hansom first, and then we’ll invent something.” He led herthrough the throng of returning holiday-makers, past sallow-facedgirls in preposterous hats, and flat-chested women struggling withpaper bundles and palm-leaf fans."
11633,5,"Was it possible that she belongedto the same race? The dinginess, the crudity of this averagesection of womanhood made him feel how highly specialized she was.A rapid shower had cooled the air, and clouds still hungrefreshingly over the moist street.“How delicious! Let us walk a little,” she said as they emergedfrom the station.They turned into Madison Avenue and began to stroll northward.As she moved beside him, with her long light step, Selden wasconscious of taking a luxurious pleasure in her nearness: in themodelling of her little ear, the crisp upward wave of her hair—wasit ever so slightly brightened by art?—and the thick plantingof her straight black lashes."
11634,5,"Everything about her was at oncevigorous and exquisite, at once strong and fine."
11635,5,"He had a confusedsense that she must have cost a great deal to make, that a greatmany dull and ugly people must, in some mysterious way, havebeen sacrificed to produce her."
11636,5,He was aware that the qualitiesdistinguishing her from the herd of her sex were chiefly external:as though a fine glaze of beauty and fastidiousness had beenapplied to vulgar clay.
11637,5,"Yet the analogy left him unsatisfied, for acoarse texture will not take a high finish; and was it not possiblethat the material was fine, but that circumstance had fashioned itinto a futile shape?As he reached this point in his speculations the sun came out, andher lifted parasol cut off his enjoyment."
11638,5,"A moment or two later shepaused with a sigh.“Oh, dear, I’m so hot and thirsty—and what a hideous place New Yorkis!” She looked despairingly up and down the dreary thoroughfare.“Other cities put on their best clothes in summer, but New Yorkseems to sit in its shirtsleeves.” Her eyes wandered down one ofthe side streets."
11639,5,“Someone has had the humanity to plant a fewtrees over there.
11640,5,"Let us go into the shade.”“I am glad my street meets with your approval,” said Selden as theyturned the corner.“Your street? Do you live here?”She glanced with interest along the new brick and limestonehouse-fronts, fantastically varied in obedience to the Americancraving for novelty, but fresh and inviting with their awnings andflower-boxes.“Ah, yes—to be sure: THE BENEDICK."
11641,5,What a nice-looking building!I don’t think I’ve ever seen it before.” She looked across at theflat-house with its marble porch and pseudo-Georgian facade.
11642,5,“Whichare your windows? Those with the awnings down?”“On the top floor—yes.”“And that nice little balcony is yours? How cool it looks up there!”He paused a moment.
11643,5,"“Come up and see,” he suggested."
11644,5,"“I can giveyou a cup of tea in no time—and you won’t meet any bores.”Her colour deepened—she still had the art of blushing at the righttime—but she took the suggestion as lightly as it was made.“Why not? It’s too tempting—I’ll take the risk,” she declared.“Oh, I’m not dangerous,” he said in the same key."
11645,5,"In truth, hehad never liked her as well as at that moment."
11646,5,"He knew she hadaccepted without afterthought: he could never be a factor in hercalculations, and there was a surprise, a refreshment almost, inthe spontaneity of her consent.On the threshold he paused a moment, feeling for his latchkey.“There’s no one here; but I have a servant who is supposed to comein the mornings, and it’s just possible he may have put out thetea-things and provided some cake.”He ushered her into a slip of a hall hung with old prints."
11647,5,"Shenoticed the letters and notes heaped on the table among his glovesand sticks; then she found herself in a small library, dark butcheerful, with its walls of books, a pleasantly faded Turkey rug,a littered desk and, as he had foretold, a tea-tray on a low tablenear the window."
11648,5,"A breeze had sprung up, swaying inward the muslincurtains, and bringing a fresh scent of mignonette and petuniasfrom the flower-box on the balcony.Lily sank with a sigh into one of the shabby leather chairs.“How delicious to have a place like this all to one’s self! What amiserable thing it is to be a woman.” She leaned back in a luxuryof discontent.Selden was rummaging in a cupboard for the cake.“Even women,” he said, “have been known to enjoy the privileges ofa flat.”“Oh, governesses—or widows."
11649,5,"But not girls—not poor, miserable,marriageable girls!”“I even know a girl who lives in a flat.”She sat up in surprise."
11650,5,"“You do?”“I do,” he assured her, emerging from the cupboard with thesought-for cake.“Oh, I know—you mean Gerty Farish.” She smiled a little unkindly.“But I said MARRIAGEABLE—and besides, she has a horrid littleplace, and no maid, and such queer things to eat."
11651,5,Her cook does thewashing and the food tastes of soap.
11652,5,"I should hate that, you know.”“You shouldn’t dine with her on wash-days,” said Selden, cuttingthe cake.They both laughed, and he knelt by the table to light the lampunder the kettle, while she measured out the tea into a littletea-pot of green glaze."
11653,5,"As he watched her hand, polished as abit of old ivory, with its slender pink nails, and the sapphirebracelet slipping over her wrist, he was struck with the ironyof suggesting to her such a life as his cousin Gertrude Farishhad chosen."
11654,5,"She was so evidently the victim of the civilizationwhich had produced her, that the links of her bracelet seemed likemanacles chaining her to her fate.She seemed to read his thought."
11655,5,"“It was horrid of me to say that ofGerty,” she said with charming compunction."
11656,5,“I forgot she was yourcousin.
11657,5,"But we’re so different, you know: she likes being good,and I like being happy."
11658,5,"And besides, she is free and I am not."
11659,5,"IfI were, I daresay I could manage to be happy even in her flat."
11660,5,"Itmust be pure bliss to arrange the furniture just as one likes, andgive all the horrors to the ash-man."
11661,5,If I could only do over myaunt’s drawing-room I know I should be a better woman.”“Is it so very bad?” he asked sympathetically.She smiled at him across the tea-pot which she was holding up to befilled.“That shows how seldom you come there.
11662,5,"Why don’t you come oftener?”“When I do come, it’s not to look at Mrs."
11663,5,"Peniston’s furniture.”“Nonsense,” she said."
11664,5,"“You don’t come at all—and yet we get on sowell when we meet.”“Perhaps that’s the reason,” he answered promptly."
11665,5,"“I’m afraidI haven’t any cream, you know—shall you mind a slice of lemoninstead?”“I shall like it better.” She waited while he cut the lemon anddropped a thin disk into her cup."
11666,5,"“But that is not the reason,” sheinsisted.“The reason for what?”“For your never coming.” She leaned forward with a shade ofperplexity in her charming eyes."
11667,5,“I wish I knew—I wish I could makeyou out.
11668,5,Of course I know there are men who don’t like me—one cantell that at a glance.
11669,5,"And there are others who are afraid of me:they think I want to marry them.” She smiled up at him frankly.“But I don’t think you dislike me—and you can’t possibly think Iwant to marry you.”“No—I absolve you of that,” he agreed.“Well, then——?”He had carried his cup to the fireplace, and stood leaning againstthe chimney-piece and looking down on her with an air of indolentamusement."
11670,5,The provocation in her eyes increased his amusement—hehad not supposed she would waste her powder on such small game; butperhaps she was only keeping her hand in; or perhaps a girl of hertype had no conversation but of the personal kind.
11671,5,"At any rate, shewas amazingly pretty, and he had asked her to tea and must live upto his obligations.“Well, then,” he said with a plunge, “perhaps THAT’S the reason.”“What?”“The fact that you don’t want to marry me."
11672,5,"Perhaps I don’t regardit as such a strong inducement to go and see you.” He felt a slightshiver down his spine as he ventured this, but her laugh reassuredhim.“Dear Mr."
11673,5,"Selden, that wasn’t worthy of you."
11674,5,"It’s stupid of you tomake love to me, and it isn’t like you to be stupid.” She leanedback, sipping her tea with an air so enchantingly judicial that,if they had been in her aunt’s drawing-room, he might almost havetried to disprove her deduction.“Don’t you see,” she continued, “that there are men enough to saypleasant things to me, and that what I want is a friend who won’tbe afraid to say disagreeable ones when I need them? Sometimes Ihave fancied you might be that friend—I don’t know why, except thatyou are neither a prig nor a bounder, and that I shouldn’t haveto pretend with you or be on my guard against you.” Her voice haddropped to a note of seriousness, and she sat gazing up at him withthe troubled gravity of a child.“You don’t know how much I need such a friend,” she said."
11675,5,"“My auntis full of copy-book axioms, but they were all meant to apply toconduct in the early fifties."
11676,5,I always feel that to live up to themwould include wearing book-muslin with gigot sleeves.
11677,5,"And the otherwomen—my best friends—well, they use me or abuse me; but they don’tcare a straw what happens to me."
11678,5,"I’ve been about too long—peopleare getting tired of me; they are beginning to say I ought to marry.”There was a moment’s pause, during which Selden meditated one ortwo replies calculated to add a momentary zest to the situation;but he rejected them in favour of the simple question: “Well, whydon’t you?”She coloured and laughed."
11679,5,"“Ah, I see you ARE a friend after all,and that is one of the disagreeable things I was asking for.”“It wasn’t meant to be disagreeable,” he returned amicably."
11680,5,“Isn’tmarriage your vocation? Isn’t it what you’re all brought up for?”She sighed.
11681,5,“I suppose so.
11682,5,What else is there?”“Exactly.
11683,5,And so why not take the plunge and have it over?”She shrugged her shoulders.
11684,5,“You speak as if I ought to marry thefirst man who came along.”“I didn’t mean to imply that you are as hard put to it as that.
11685,5,Butthere must be some one with the requisite qualifications.”She shook her head wearily.
11686,5,“I threw away one or two good chanceswhen I first came out—I suppose every girl does; and you know Iam horribly poor—and very expensive.
11687,5,"I must have a great deal ofmoney.”Selden had turned to reach for a cigarette-box on the mantelpiece.“What’s become of Dillworth?” he asked.“Oh, his mother was frightened—she was afraid I should have all thefamily jewels reset."
11688,5,And she wanted me to promise that I wouldn’tdo over the drawing-room.”“The very thing you are marrying for!”“Exactly.
11689,5,"So she packed him off to India.”“Hard luck—but you can do better than Dillworth.”He offered the box, and she took out three or four cigarettes,putting one between her lips and slipping the others into a littlegold case attached to her long pearl chain.“Have I time? Just a whiff, then.” She leaned forward, holding thetip of her cigarette to his."
11690,5,"As she did so, he noted, with a purelyimpersonal enjoyment, how evenly the black lashes were set in hersmooth white lids, and how the purplish shade beneath them meltedinto the pure pallor of the cheek.She began to saunter about the room, examining the bookshelvesbetween the puffs of her cigarette-smoke."
11691,5,"Some of the volumeshad the ripe tints of good tooling and old morocco, and her eyeslingered on them caressingly, not with the appreciation of theexpert, but with the pleasure in agreeable tones and textures thatwas one of her inmost susceptibilities."
11692,5,"Suddenly her expressionchanged from desultory enjoyment to active conjecture, and sheturned to Selden with a question.“You collect, don’t you—you know about first editions and things?”“As much as a man may who has no money to spend."
11693,5,"Now and then Ipick up something in the rubbish heap; and I go and look on at thebig sales.”She had again addressed herself to the shelves, but her eyes nowswept them inattentively, and he saw that she was preoccupied witha new idea.“And Americana—do you collect Americana?”Selden stared and laughed.“No, that’s rather out of my line."
11694,5,"I’m not really a collector, yousee; I simply like to have good editions of the books I am fond of.”She made a slight grimace."
11695,5,"“And Americana are horribly dull, Isuppose?”“I should fancy so—except to the historian."
11696,5,But your real collectorvalues a thing for its rarity.
11697,5,I don’t suppose the buyers ofAmericana sit up reading them all night—old Jefferson Grycecertainly didn’t.”She was listening with keen attention.
11698,5,"“And yet they fetch fabulousprices, don’t they? It seems so odd to want to pay a lot for anugly badly-printed book that one is never going to read! And Isuppose most of the owners of Americana are not historians either?”“No; very few of the historians can afford to buy them."
11699,5,They haveto use those in the public libraries or in private collections.
11700,5,"Itseems to be the mere rarity that attracts the average collector.”He had seated himself on an arm of the chair near which she wasstanding, and she continued to question him, asking which were therarest volumes, whether the Jefferson Gryce collection was reallyconsidered the finest in the world, and what was the largest priceever fetched by a single volume.It was so pleasant to sit there looking up at her, as she liftednow one book and then another from the shelves, fluttering thepages between her fingers, while her drooping profile was outlinedagainst the warm background of old bindings, that he talked onwithout pausing to wonder at her sudden interest in so unsuggestivea subject."
11701,5,"But he could never be long with her without trying tofind a reason for what she was doing, and as she replaced hisfirst edition of La Bruyere and turned away from the bookcases,he began to ask himself what she had been driving at."
11702,5,Her nextquestion was not of a nature to enlighten him.
11703,5,"She paused beforehim with a smile which seemed at once designed to admit him to herfamiliarity, and to remind him of the restrictions it imposed.“Don’t you ever mind,” she asked suddenly, “not being rich enoughto buy all the books you want?”He followed her glance about the room, with its worn furniture andshabby walls.“Don’t I just? Do you take me for a saint on a pillar?”“And having to work—do you mind that?”“Oh, the work itself is not so bad—I’m rather fond of the law.”“No; but the being tied down: the routine—don’t you ever want toget away, to see new places and people?”“Horribly—especially when I see all my friends rushing to thesteamer.”She drew a sympathetic breath."
11704,5,“But do you mind enough—to marry toget out of it?”Selden broke into a laugh.
11705,5,"“God forbid!” he declared.She rose with a sigh, tossing her cigarette into the grate.“Ah, there’s the difference—a girl must, a man may if he chooses.”She surveyed him critically."
11706,5,“Your coat’s a little shabby—but whocares? It doesn’t keep people from asking you to dine.
11707,5,If I wereshabby no one would have me: a woman is asked out as much forher clothes as for herself.
11708,5,"The clothes are the background, theframe, if you like: they don’t make success, but they are a partof it."
11709,5,"Who wants a dingy woman? We are expected to be pretty andwell-dressed till we drop—and if we can’t keep it up alone, we haveto go into partnership.”Selden glanced at her with amusement: it was impossible, even withher lovely eyes imploring him, to take a sentimental view of hercase.“Ah, well, there must be plenty of capital on the look-out forsuch an investment."
11710,5,"Perhaps you’ll meet your fate tonight at theTrenors’.”She returned his look interrogatively.“I thought you might be going there—oh, not in that capacity! Butthere are to be a lot of your set—Gwen Van Osburgh, the Wetheralls,Lady Cressida Raith—and the George Dorsets.”She paused a moment before the last name, and shot a query throughher lashes; but he remained imperturbable.“Mrs."
11711,5,"Trenor asked me; but I can’t get away till the end of theweek; and those big parties bore me.”“Ah, so they do me,” she exclaimed.“Then why go?”“It’s part of the business—you forget! And besides, if I didn’t, Ishould be playing bezique with my aunt at Richfield Springs.”“That’s almost as bad as marrying Dillworth,” he agreed, and theyboth laughed for pure pleasure in their sudden intimacy.She glanced at the clock.“Dear me! I must be off."
11712,5,"It’s after five.”She paused before the mantelpiece, studying herself in the mirrorwhile she adjusted her veil."
11713,5,"The attitude revealed the long slopeof her slender sides, which gave a kind of wild-wood grace toher outline—as though she were a captured dryad subdued to theconventions of the drawing-room; and Selden reflected that it wasthe same streak of sylvan freedom in her nature that lent suchsavour to her artificiality.He followed her across the room to the entrance-hall; but on thethreshold she held out her hand with a gesture of leave-taking.“It’s been delightful; and now you will have to return my visit.”“But don’t you want me to see you to the station?”“No; good bye here, please.”She let her hand lie in his a moment, smiling up at him adorably.“Good bye, then—and good luck at Bellomont!” he said, opening thedoor for her.On the landing she paused to look about her."
11714,5,"There were a thousandchances to one against her meeting anybody, but one could nevertell, and she always paid for her rare indiscretions by a violentreaction of prudence."
11715,5,"There was no one in sight, however, but achar-woman who was scrubbing the stairs."
11716,5,"Her own stout person andits surrounding implements took up so much room that Lily, to passher, had to gather up her skirts and brush against the wall."
11717,5,"Asshe did so, the woman paused in her work and looked up curiously,resting her clenched red fists on the wet cloth she had just drawnfrom her pail."
11718,5,"She had a broad sallow face, slightly pitted withsmall-pox, and thin straw-coloured hair through which her scalpshone unpleasantly.“I beg your pardon,” said Lily, intending by her politeness toconvey a criticism of the other’s manner.The woman, without answering, pushed her pail aside, and continuedto stare as Miss Bart swept by with a murmur of silken linings.Lily felt herself flushing under the look."
11719,5,"What did the creaturesuppose? Could one never do the simplest, the most harmless thing,without subjecting one’s self to some odious conjecture? Half waydown the next flight, she smiled to think that a char-woman’s stareshould so perturb her."
11720,5,The poor thing was probably dazzled by suchan unwonted apparition.
11721,5,"But WERE such apparitions unwonted onSelden’s stairs? Miss Bart was not familiar with the moral code ofbachelors’ flat-houses, and her colour rose again as it occurred toher that the woman’s persistent gaze implied a groping among pastassociations."
11722,5,"But she put aside the thought with a smile at her ownfears, and hastened downward, wondering if she should find a cabshort of Fifth Avenue.Under the Georgian porch she paused again, scanning the street fora hansom."
11723,5,"None was in sight, but as she reached the sidewalk sheran against a small glossy-looking man with a gardenia in his coat,who raised his hat with a surprised exclamation.“Miss Bart? Well—of all people! This IS luck,” he declared; and shecaught a twinkle of amused curiosity between his screwed-up lids.“Oh, Mr."
11724,5,"Rosedale—how are you?” she said, perceiving that theirrepressible annoyance on her face was reflected in the suddenintimacy of his smile.Mr."
11725,5,Rosedale stood scanning her with interest and approval.
11726,5,"Hewas a plump rosy man of the blond Jewish type, with smart Londonclothes fitting him like upholstery, and small sidelong eyes whichgave him the air of appraising people as if they were bric-a-brac.He glanced up interrogatively at the porch of the Benedick.“Been up to town for a little shopping, I suppose?” he said, in atone which had the familiarity of a touch.Miss Bart shrank from it slightly, and then flung herself intoprecipitate explanations.“Yes—I came up to see my dress-maker."
11727,5,"I am just on my way to catchthe train to the Trenors’.”“Ah—your dress-maker; just so,” he said blandly."
11728,5,“I didn’t knowthere were any dress-makers in the Benedick.”“The Benedick?” She looked gently puzzled.
11729,5,"“Is that the name ofthis building?”“Yes, that’s the name: I believe it’s an old word for bachelor,isn’t it? I happen to own the building—that’s the way I know.” Hissmile deepened as he added with increasing assurance: “But you mustlet me take you to the station."
11730,5,"The Trenors are at Bellomont, ofcourse? You’ve barely time to catch the five-forty."
11731,5,"The dress-makerkept you waiting, I suppose.”Lily stiffened under the pleasantry.“Oh, thanks,” she stammered; and at that moment her eye caughta hansom drifting down Madison Avenue, and she hailed it with adesperate gesture.“You’re very kind; but I couldn’t think of troubling you,” shesaid, extending her hand to Mr."
11732,5,"Rosedale; and heedless of hisprotestations, she sprang into the rescuing vehicle, and called outa breathless order to the driver.Chapter 2In the hansom she leaned back with a sigh."
11733,5,"Why must a girl pay sodearly for her least escape from routine? Why could one never doa natural thing without having to screen it behind a structure ofartifice? She had yielded to a passing impulse in going to LawrenceSelden’s rooms, and it was so seldom that she could allow herselfthe luxury of an impulse! This one, at any rate, was going to costher rather more than she could afford."
11734,5,"She was vexed to see that,in spite of so many years of vigilance, she had blundered twicewithin five minutes."
11735,5,That stupid story about her dress-maker wasbad enough—it would have been so simple to tell Rosedale that shehad been taking tea with Selden! The mere statement of the factwould have rendered it innocuous.
11736,5,"But, after having let herselfbe surprised in a falsehood, it was doubly stupid to snub thewitness of her discomfiture."
11737,5,"If she had had the presence of mind tolet Rosedale drive her to the station, the concession might havepurchased his silence."
11738,5,"He had his race’s accuracy in the appraisalof values, and to be seen walking down the platform at the crowdedafternoon hour in the company of Miss Lily Bart would have beenmoney in his pocket, as he might himself have phrased it."
11739,5,"He knew,of course, that there would be a large house-party at Bellomont,and the possibility of being taken for one of Mrs."
11740,5,Trenor’s guestswas doubtless included in his calculations.
11741,5,Mr.
11742,5,"Rosedale was stillat a stage in his social ascent when it was of importance toproduce such impressions.The provoking part was that Lily knew all this—knew how easy itwould have been to silence him on the spot, and how difficult itmight be to do so afterward."
11743,5,Mr.
11744,5,"Simon Rosedale was a man whomade it his business to know everything about every one, whoseidea of showing himself to be at home in society was to displayan inconvenient familiarity with the habits of those with whomhe wished to be thought intimate."
11745,5,Lily was sure that withintwenty-four hours the story of her visiting her dress-maker atthe Benedick would be in active circulation among Mr.
11746,5,Rosedale’sacquaintances.
11747,5,The worst of it was that she had always snubbed andignored him.
11748,5,"On his first appearance—when her improvident cousin,Jack Stepney, had obtained for him (in return for favours tooeasily guessed) a card to one of the vast impersonal Van Osburgh“crushes”—Rosedale, with that mixture of artistic sensibility andbusiness astuteness which characterizes his race, had instantlygravitated toward Miss Bart."
11749,5,"She understood his motives, forher own course was guided by as nice calculations."
11750,5,"Training andexperience had taught her to be hospitable to newcomers, since themost unpromising might be useful later on, and there were plentyof available OUBLIETTES to swallow them if they were not."
11751,5,"Butsome intuitive repugnance, getting the better of years of socialdiscipline, had made her push Mr."
11752,5,Rosedale into his OUBLIETTEwithout a trial.
11753,5,"He had left behind only the ripple of amusementwhich his speedy despatch had caused among her friends; and thoughlater (to shift the metaphor) he reappeared lower down the stream,it was only in fleeting glimpses, with long submergences between.Hitherto Lily had been undisturbed by scruples."
11754,5,In her little setMr.
11755,5,"Rosedale had been pronounced “impossible,” and Jack Stepneyroundly snubbed for his attempt to pay his debts in dinnerinvitations."
11756,5,Even Mrs.
11757,5,"Trenor, whose taste for variety had ledher into some hazardous experiments, resisted Jack’s attempts todisguise Mr."
11758,5,"Rosedale as a novelty, and declared that he was thesame little Jew who had been served up and rejected at the socialboard a dozen times within her memory; and while Judy Trenor wasobdurate there was small chance of Mr."
11759,5,Rosedale’s penetratingbeyond the outer limbo of the Van Osburgh crushes.
11760,5,"Jack gave up thecontest with a laughing “You’ll see,” and, sticking manfully to hisguns, showed himself with Rosedale at the fashionable restaurants,in company with the personally vivid if socially obscure ladies whoare available for such purposes."
11761,5,"But the attempt had hitherto beenvain, and as Rosedale undoubtedly paid for the dinners, the laughremained with his debtor.Mr."
11762,5,"Rosedale, it will be seen, was thus far not a factor to befeared—unless one put one’s self in his power."
11763,5,And this wasprecisely what Miss Bart had done.
11764,5,Her clumsy fib had let him seethat she had something to conceal; and she was sure he had a scoreto settle with her.
11765,5,Something in his smile told her he had notforgotten.
11766,5,"She turned from the thought with a little shiver, butit hung on her all the way to the station, and dogged her down theplatform with the persistency of Mr."
11767,5,"Rosedale himself.She had just time to take her seat before the train started; buthaving arranged herself in her corner with the instinctive feelingfor effect which never forsook her, she glanced about in the hopeof seeing some other member of the Trenors’ party."
11768,5,"She wanted toget away from herself, and conversation was the only means ofescape that she knew.Her search was rewarded by the discovery of a very blond young manwith a soft reddish beard, who, at the other end of the carriage,appeared to be dissembling himself behind an unfolded newspaper.Lily’s eye brightened, and a faint smile relaxed the drawn linesof her mouth."
11769,5,She had known that Mr.
11770,5,"Percy Gryce was to be atBellomont, but she had not counted on the luck of having him toherself in the train; and the fact banished all perturbing thoughtsof Mr."
11771,5,Rosedale.
11772,5,"Perhaps, after all, the day was to end morefavourably than it had begun.She began to cut the pages of a novel, tranquilly studying herprey through downcast lashes while she organized a method ofattack."
11773,5,"Something in his attitude of conscious absorption toldher that he was aware of her presence: no one had ever been quiteso engrossed in an evening paper! She guessed that he was too shyto come up to her, and that she would have to devise some meansof approach which should not appear to be an advance on her part.It amused her to think that any one as rich as Mr."
11774,5,"Percy Gryceshould be shy; but she was gifted with treasures of indulgence forsuch idiosyncrasies, and besides, his timidity might serve herpurpose better than too much assurance."
11775,5,"She had the art of givingself-confidence to the embarrassed, but she was not equally sure ofbeing able to embarrass the self-confident.She waited till the train had emerged from the tunnel and wasracing between the ragged edges of the northern suburbs."
11776,5,"Then,as it lowered its speed near Yonkers, she rose from her seat anddrifted slowly down the carriage."
11777,5,As she passed Mr.
11778,5,"Gryce, thetrain gave a lurch, and he was aware of a slender hand gripping theback of his chair."
11779,5,"He rose with a start, his ingenuous face lookingas though it had been dipped in crimson: even the reddish tint inhis beard seemed to deepen."
11780,5,"The train swayed again, almost flingingMiss Bart into his arms.She steadied herself with a laugh and drew back; but he wasenveloped in the scent of her dress, and his shoulder had felt herfugitive touch.“Oh, Mr."
11781,5,"Gryce, is it you? I’m so sorry—I was trying to find theporter and get some tea.”She held out her hand as the train resumed its level rush, and theystood exchanging a few words in the aisle."
11782,5,Yes—he was going toBellomont.
11783,5,He had heard she was to be of the party—he blushed againas he admitted it.
11784,5,"And was he to be there for a whole week? Howdelightful!But at this point one or two belated passengers from the laststation forced their way into the carriage, and Lily had to retreatto her seat.“The chair next to mine is empty—do take it,” she said over hershoulder; and Mr."
11785,5,"Gryce, with considerable embarrassment, succeededin effecting an exchange which enabled him to transport himself andhis bags to her side.“Ah—and here is the porter, and perhaps we can have some tea.”She signalled to that official, and in a moment, with the ease thatseemed to attend the fulfilment of all her wishes, a little tablehad been set up between the seats, and she had helped Mr."
11786,5,"Gryce tobestow his encumbering properties beneath it.When the tea came he watched her in silent fascination whileher hands flitted above the tray, looking miraculously fine andslender in contrast to the coarse china and lumpy bread."
11787,5,It seemedwonderful to him that any one should perform with such carelessease the difficult task of making tea in public in a lurchingtrain.
11788,5,"He would never have dared to order it for himself, lest heshould attract the notice of his fellow-passengers; but, secure inthe shelter of her conspicuousness, he sipped the inky draught witha delicious sense of exhilaration.Lily, with the flavour of Selden’s caravan tea on her lips, hadno great fancy to drown it in the railway brew which seemed suchnectar to her companion; but, rightly judging that one of thecharms of tea is the fact of drinking it together, she proceededto give the last touch to Mr."
11789,5,"Gryce’s enjoyment by smiling at himacross her lifted cup.“Is it quite right—I haven’t made it too strong?” she askedsolicitously; and he replied with conviction that he had nevertasted better tea.“I daresay it is true,” she reflected; and her imagination wasfired by the thought that Mr."
11790,5,"Gryce, who might have sounded thedepths of the most complex self-indulgence, was perhaps actuallytaking his first journey alone with a pretty woman.It struck her as providential that she should be the instrumentof his initiation."
11791,5,Some girls would not have known how tomanage him.
11792,5,"They would have over-emphasized the novelty of theadventure, trying to make him feel in it the zest of an escapade.But Lily’s methods were more delicate."
11793,5,She remembered that hercousin Jack Stepney had once defined Mr.
11794,5,"Gryce as the young manwho had promised his mother never to go out in the rain withouthis overshoes; and acting on this hint, she resolved to impart agently domestic air to the scene, in the hope that her companion,instead of feeling that he was doing something reckless or unusual,would merely be led to dwell on the advantage of always having acompanion to make one’s tea in the train.But in spite of her efforts, conversation flagged after the trayhad been removed, and she was driven to take a fresh measurementof Mr."
11795,5,Gryce’s limitations.
11796,5,"It was not, after all, opportunity butimagination that he lacked: he had a mental palate which wouldnever learn to distinguish between railway tea and nectar."
11797,5,"Therewas, however, one topic she could rely on: one spring that shehad only to touch to set his simple machinery in motion."
11798,5,"She hadrefrained from touching it because it was a last resource, and shehad relied on other arts to stimulate other sensations; but as asettled look of dulness began to creep over his candid features,she saw that extreme measures were necessary.“And how,” she said, leaning forward, “are you getting on with yourAmericana?”His eye became a degree less opaque: it was as though an incipientfilm had been removed from it, and she felt the pride of a skilfuloperator.“I’ve got a few new things,” he said, suffused with pleasure, butlowering his voice as though he feared his fellow-passengers mightbe in league to despoil him.She returned a sympathetic enquiry, and gradually he was drawnon to talk of his latest purchases."
11799,5,"It was the one subject whichenabled him to forget himself, or allowed him, rather, to rememberhimself without constraint, because he was at home in it, and couldassert a superiority that there were few to dispute."
11800,5,"Hardly any ofhis acquaintances cared for Americana, or knew anything about them;and the consciousness of this ignorance threw Mr."
11801,5,Gryce’s knowledgeinto agreeable relief.
11802,5,"The only difficulty was to introduce thetopic and to keep it to the front; most people showed no desire tohave their ignorance dispelled, and Mr."
11803,5,"Gryce was like a merchantwhose warehouses are crammed with an unmarketable commodity.But Miss Bart, it appeared, really did want to know aboutAmericana; and moreover, she was already sufficiently informed tomake the task of farther instruction as easy as it was agreeable.She questioned him intelligently, she heard him submissively; and,prepared for the look of lassitude which usually crept over hislisteners’ faces, he grew eloquent under her receptive gaze."
11804,5,"The“points” she had had the presence of mind to glean from Selden, inanticipation of this very contingency, were serving her to suchgood purpose that she began to think her visit to him had been theluckiest incident of the day."
11805,5,"She had once more shown her talentfor profiting by the unexpected, and dangerous theories as to theadvisability of yielding to impulse were germinating under thesurface of smiling attention which she continued to present to hercompanion.Mr."
11806,5,"Gryce’s sensations, if less definite, were equally agreeable.He felt the confused titillation with which the lower organismswelcome the gratification of their needs, and all his sensesfloundered in a vague well-being, through which Miss Bart’spersonality was dimly but pleasantly perceptible.Mr."
11807,5,Gryce’s interest in Americana had not originated with himself:it was impossible to think of him as evolving any taste of hisown.
11808,5,"An uncle had left him a collection already noted amongbibliophiles; the existence of the collection was the only factthat had ever shed glory on the name of Gryce, and the nephew tookas much pride in his inheritance as though it had been his ownwork."
11809,5,"Indeed, he gradually came to regard it as such, and to feel asense of personal complacency when he chanced on any reference tothe Gryce Americana."
11810,5,"Anxious as he was to avoid personal notice, hetook, in the printed mention of his name, a pleasure so exquisiteand excessive that it seemed a compensation for his shrinking frompublicity.To enjoy the sensation as often as possible, he subscribed to allthe reviews dealing with book-collecting in general, and Americanhistory in particular, and as allusions to his library aboundedin the pages of these journals, which formed his only reading, hecame to regard himself as figuring prominently in the public eye,and to enjoy the thought of the interest which would be excitedif the persons he met in the street, or sat among in travelling,were suddenly to be told that he was the possessor of the GryceAmericana.Most timidities have such secret compensations, and Miss Bart wasdiscerning enough to know that the inner vanity is generally inproportion to the outer self-depreciation."
11811,5,"With a more confidentperson she would not have dared to dwell so long on one topic,or to show such exaggerated interest in it; but she had rightlyguessed that Mr."
11812,5,"Gryce’s egoism was a thirsty soil, requiringconstant nurture from without."
11813,5,Miss Bart had the gift of followingan undercurrent of thought while she appeared to be sailing on thesurface of conversation; and in this case her mental excursiontook the form of a rapid survey of Mr.
11814,5,Percy Gryce’s future ascombined with her own.
11815,5,"The Gryces were from Albany, and but latelyintroduced to the metropolis, where the mother and son had come,after old Jefferson Gryce’s death, to take possession of his housein Madison Avenue—an appalling house, all brown stone without andblack walnut within, with the Gryce library in a fire-proof annexthat looked like a mausoleum."
11816,5,"Lily, however, knew all about them:young Mr."
11817,5,"Gryce’s arrival had fluttered the maternal breasts ofNew York, and when a girl has no mother to palpitate for her shemust needs be on the alert for herself."
11818,5,"Lily, therefore, had notonly contrived to put herself in the young man’s way, but had madethe acquaintance of Mrs."
11819,5,"Gryce, a monumental woman with the voiceof a pulpit orator and a mind preoccupied with the iniquities ofher servants, who came sometimes to sit with Mrs."
11820,5,Peniston andlearn from that lady how she managed to prevent the kitchen-maid’ssmuggling groceries out of the house.
11821,5,Mrs.
11822,5,"Gryce had a kind ofimpersonal benevolence: cases of individual need she regardedwith suspicion, but she subscribed to Institutions when theirannual reports showed an impressive surplus."
11823,5,"Her domestic dutieswere manifold, for they extended from furtive inspections of theservants’ bedrooms to unannounced descents to the cellar; but shehad never allowed herself many pleasures."
11824,5,"Once, however, she hadhad a special edition of the Sarum Rule printed in rubric andpresented to every clergyman in the diocese; and the gilt album inwhich their letters of thanks were pasted formed the chief ornamentof her drawing-room table.Percy had been brought up in the principles which so excellent awoman was sure to inculcate."
11825,5,"Every form of prudence and suspicionhad been grafted on a nature originally reluctant and cautious,with the result that it would have seemed hardly needful for Mrs.Gryce to extract his promise about the overshoes, so little likelywas he to hazard himself abroad in the rain."
11826,5,"After attaining hismajority, and coming into the fortune which the late Mr."
11827,5,"Gryce hadmade out of a patent device for excluding fresh air from hotels,the young man continued to live with his mother in Albany; buton Jefferson Gryce’s death, when another large property passedinto her son’s hands, Mrs."
11828,5,Gryce thought that what she called his“interests” demanded his presence in New York.
11829,5,"She accordinglyinstalled herself in the Madison Avenue house, and Percy, whosesense of duty was not inferior to his mother’s, spent all his weekdays in the handsome Broad Street office where a batch of pale menon small salaries had grown grey in the management of the Gryceestate, and where he was initiated with becoming reverence intoevery detail of the art of accumulation.As far as Lily could learn, this had hitherto been Mr."
11830,5,"Gryce’s onlyoccupation, and she might have been pardoned for thinking it nottoo hard a task to interest a young man who had been kept on suchlow diet."
11831,5,"At any rate, she felt herself so completely in command ofthe situation that she yielded to a sense of security in which allfear of Mr."
11832,5,"Rosedale, and of the difficulties on which that fearwas contingent, vanished beyond the edge of thought.The stopping of the train at Garrisons would not have distractedher from these thoughts, had she not caught a sudden look ofdistress in her companion’s eye."
11833,5,"His seat faced toward the door,and she guessed that he had been perturbed by the approach of anacquaintance; a fact confirmed by the turning of heads and generalsense of commotion which her own entrance into a railway-carriagewas apt to produce.She knew the symptoms at once, and was not surprised to be hailedby the high notes of a pretty woman, who entered the trainaccompanied by a maid, a bull-terrier, and a footman staggeringunder a load of bags and dressing-cases.“Oh, Lily—are you going to Bellomont? Then you can’t let mehave your seat, I suppose? But I MUST have a seat in thiscarriage—porter, you must find me a place at once."
11834,5,Can’t some onebe put somewhere else? I want to be with my friends.
11835,5,"Oh, how do youdo, Mr."
11836,5,Gryce? Do please make him understand that I must have aseat next to you and Lily.”Mrs.
11837,5,"George Dorset, regardless of the mild efforts of a travellerwith a carpet-bag, who was doing his best to make room for herby getting out of the train, stood in the middle of the aisle,diffusing about her that general sense of exasperation which apretty woman on her travels not infrequently creates.She was smaller and thinner than Lily Bart, with a restlesspliability of pose, as if she could have been crumpled up and runthrough a ring, like the sinuous draperies she affected."
11838,5,"Her smallpale face seemed the mere setting of a pair of dark exaggeratedeyes, of which the visionary gaze contrasted curiously with herself-assertive tone and gestures; so that, as one of her friendsobserved, she was like a disembodied spirit who took up a greatdeal of room.Having finally discovered that the seat adjoining Miss Bart’swas at her disposal, she possessed herself of it with a fartherdisplacement of her surroundings, explaining meanwhile that she hadcome across from Mount Kisco in her motor-car that morning, and hadbeen kicking her heels for an hour at Garrisons, without even thealleviation of a cigarette, her brute of a husband having neglectedto replenish her case before they parted that morning.“And at this hour of the day I don’t suppose you’ve a single oneleft, have you, Lily?” she plaintively concluded.Miss Bart caught the startled glance of Mr."
11839,5,"Percy Gryce, whose ownlips were never defiled by tobacco.“What an absurd question, Bertha!” she exclaimed, blushing at thethought of the store she had laid in at Lawrence Selden’s.“Why, don’t you smoke? Since when have you given it up? What—younever—— And you don’t either, Mr."
11840,5,"Gryce? Ah, of course—how stupidof me—I understand.”And Mrs."
11841,5,"Dorset leaned back against her travelling cushions with asmile which made Lily wish there had been no vacant seat beside herown.Chapter 3Bridge at Bellomont usually lasted till the small hours; and whenLily went to bed that night she had played too long for her owngood.Feeling no desire for the self-communion which awaited her in herroom, she lingered on the broad stairway, looking down into thehall below, where the last card-players were grouped about the trayof tall glasses and silver-collared decanters which the butler hadjust placed on a low table near the fire.The hall was arcaded, with a gallery supported on columns ofpale yellow marble."
11842,5,"Tall clumps of flowering plants were groupedagainst a background of dark foliage in the angles of the walls.On the crimson carpet a deer-hound and two or three spaniels dozedluxuriously before the fire, and the light from the great centrallantern overhead shed a brightness on the women’s hair and strucksparks from their jewels as they moved.There were moments when such scenes delighted Lily, when theygratified her sense of beauty and her craving for the externalfinish of life; there were others when they gave a sharper edgeto the meagreness of her own opportunities."
11843,5,"This was one of themoments when the sense of contrast was uppermost, and she turnedaway impatiently as Mrs."
11844,5,"George Dorset, glittering in serpentinespangles, drew Percy Gryce in her wake to a confidential nookbeneath the gallery.It was not that Miss Bart was afraid of losing her newly-acquiredhold over Mr."
11845,5,Gryce.
11846,5,Mrs.
11847,5,"Dorset might startle or dazzle him,but she had neither the skill nor the patience to effect hiscapture."
11848,5,"She was too self-engrossed to penetrate the recesses ofhis shyness, and besides, why should she care to give herself thetrouble? At most it might amuse her to make sport of his simplicityfor an evening—after that he would be merely a burden to her, andknowing this, she was far too experienced to encourage him."
11849,5,"Butthe mere thought of that other woman, who could take a man up andtoss him aside as she willed, without having to regard him as apossible factor in her plans, filled Lily Bart with envy."
11850,5,"She hadbeen bored all the afternoon by Percy Gryce—the mere thought seemedto waken an echo of his droning voice—but she could not ignore himon the morrow, she must follow up her success, must submit to moreboredom, must be ready with fresh compliances and adaptabilities,and all on the bare chance that he might ultimately decide to doher the honour of boring her for life.It was a hateful fate—but how escape from it? What choice had she?To be herself, or a Gerty Farish."
11851,5,"As she entered her bedroom, withits softly-shaded lights, her lace dressing-gown lying acrossthe silken bedspread, her little embroidered slippers before thefire, a vase of carnations filling the air with perfume, andthe last novels and magazines lying uncut on a table beside thereading-lamp, she had a vision of Miss Farish’s cramped flat, withits cheap conveniences and hideous wall-papers."
11852,5,"No; she was notmade for mean and shabby surroundings, for the squalid compromisesof poverty."
11853,5,"Her whole being dilated in an atmosphere of luxury; itwas the background she required, the only climate she could breathein."
11854,5,But the luxury of others was not what she wanted.
11855,5,A few yearsago it had sufficed her: she had taken her daily meed of pleasurewithout caring who provided it.
11856,5,"Now she was beginning to chafe atthe obligations it imposed, to feel herself a mere pensioner on thesplendour which had once seemed to belong to her."
11857,5,There were evenmoments when she was conscious of having to pay her way.For a long time she had refused to play bridge.
11858,5,"She knew she couldnot afford it, and she was afraid of acquiring so expensive ataste."
11859,5,"She had seen the danger exemplified in more than one of herassociates—in young Ned Silverton, for instance, the charming fairboy now seated in abject rapture at the elbow of Mrs."
11860,5,"Fisher, astriking divorcee with eyes and gowns as emphatic as the head-linesof her “case.” Lily could remember when young Silverton hadstumbled into their circle, with the air of a strayed Arcadianwho has published charming sonnets in his college journal."
11861,5,Sincethen he had developed a taste for Mrs.
11862,5,"Fisher and bridge, and thelatter at least had involved him in expenses from which he had beenmore than once rescued by harassed maiden sisters, who treasuredthe sonnets, and went without sugar in their tea to keep theirdarling afloat."
11863,5,"Ned’s case was familiar to Lily: she had seen hischarming eyes—which had a good deal more poetry in them than thesonnets—change from surprise to amusement, and from amusementto anxiety, as he passed under the spell of the terrible god ofchance; and she was afraid of discovering the same symptoms in herown case.For in the last year she had found that her hostesses expected herto take a place at the card-table."
11864,5,"It was one of the taxes shehad to pay for their prolonged hospitality, and for the dressesand trinkets which occasionally replenished her insufficientwardrobe."
11865,5,And since she had played regularly the passion had grownon her.
11866,5,"Once or twice of late she had won a large sum, and insteadof keeping it against future losses, had spent it in dress orjewelry; and the desire to atone for this imprudence, combinedwith the increasing exhilaration of the game, drove her to riskhigher stakes at each fresh venture."
11867,5,"She tried to excuse herselfon the plea that, in the Trenor set, if one played at all one musteither play high or be set down as priggish or stingy; but she knewthat the gambling passion was upon her, and that in her presentsurroundings there was small hope of resisting it.Tonight the luck had been persistently bad, and the little goldpurse which hung among her trinkets was almost empty when shereturned to her room."
11868,5,"She unlocked the wardrobe, and taking out herjewel-case, looked under the tray for the roll of bills from whichshe had replenished the purse before going down to dinner."
11869,5,Onlytwenty dollars were left: the discovery was so startling that for amoment she fancied she must have been robbed.
11870,5,"Then she took paperand pencil, and seating herself at the writing-table, tried toreckon up what she had spent during the day."
11871,5,"Her head was throbbingwith fatigue, and she had to go over the figures again and again;but at last it became clear to her that she had lost three hundreddollars at cards."
11872,5,"She took out her cheque-book to see if herbalance was larger than she remembered, but found she had erredin the other direction."
11873,5,"Then she returned to her calculations;but figure as she would, she could not conjure back the vanishedthree hundred dollars."
11874,5,It was the sum she had set aside to pacifyher dress-maker—unless she should decide to use it as a sop to thejeweller.
11875,5,"At any rate, she had so many uses for it that its veryinsufficiency had caused her to play high in the hope of doublingit."
11876,5,"But of course she had lost—she who needed every penny, whileBertha Dorset, whose husband showered money on her, must havepocketed at least five hundred, and Judy Trenor, who could haveafforded to lose a thousand a night, had left the table clutchingsuch a heap of bills that she had been unable to shake hands withher guests when they bade her good night.A world in which such things could be seemed a miserable placeto Lily Bart; but then she had never been able to understand thelaws of a universe which was so ready to leave her out of itscalculations.She began to undress without ringing for her maid, whom she hadsent to bed."
11877,5,"She had been long enough in bondage to other people’spleasure to be considerate of those who depended on hers, and inher bitter moods it sometimes struck her that she and her maid werein the same position, except that the latter received her wagesmore regularly.As she sat before the mirror brushing her hair, her face lookedhollow and pale, and she was frightened by two little lines nearher mouth, faint flaws in the smooth curve of the cheek.“Oh, I must stop worrying!” she exclaimed."
11878,5,"“Unless it’s theelectric light——” she reflected, springing up from her seat andlighting the candles on the dressing-table.She turned out the wall-lights, and peered at herself between thecandle-flames."
11879,5,"The white oval of her face swam out waveringly froma background of shadows, the uncertain light blurring it like ahaze; but the two lines about the mouth remained.Lily rose and undressed in haste.“It is only because I am tired and have such odious things to thinkabout,” she kept repeating; and it seemed an added injustice thatpetty cares should leave a trace on the beauty which was her onlydefence against them.But the odious things were there, and remained with her."
11880,5,"Shereturned wearily to the thought of Percy Gryce, as a wayfarer picksup a heavy load and toils on after a brief rest."
11881,5,She was almostsure she had “landed” him: a few days’ work and she would win herreward.
11882,5,But the reward itself seemed unpalatable just then: shecould get no zest from the thought of victory.
11883,5,"It would be a restfrom worry, no more—and how little that would have seemed to hera few years earlier! Her ambitions had shrunk gradually in thedesiccating air of failure."
11884,5,"But why had she failed? Was it her ownfault or that of destiny?She remembered how her mother, after they had lost their money, usedto say to her with a kind of fierce vindictiveness: “But you’ll getit all back—you’ll get it all back, with your face.”..."
11885,5,"Theremembrance roused a whole train of association, and she lay in thedarkness reconstructing the past out of which her present had grown.A house in which no one ever dined at home unless there was“company”; a door-bell perpetually ringing; a hall-table showeredwith square envelopes which were opened in haste, and oblongenvelopes which were allowed to gather dust in the depths of abronze jar; a series of French and English maids giving warningamid a chaos of hurriedly-ransacked wardrobes and dress-closets;an equally changing dynasty of nurses and footmen; quarrels in thepantry, the kitchen and the drawing-room; precipitate trips toEurope, and returns with gorged trunks and days of interminableunpacking; semi-annual discussions as to where the summer shouldbe spent, grey interludes of economy and brilliant reactions ofexpense—such was the setting of Lily Bart’s first memories.Ruling the turbulent element called home was the vigorous anddetermined figure of a mother still young enough to dance herball-dresses to rags, while the hazy outline of a neutral-tintedfather filled an intermediate space between the butler and the manwho came to wind the clocks."
11886,5,"Even to the eyes of infancy, Mrs.Hudson Bart had appeared young; but Lily could not recall the timewhen her father had not been bald and slightly stooping, withstreaks of grey in his hair, and a tired walk."
11887,5,It was a shock toher to learn afterward that he was but two years older than hermother.Lily seldom saw her father by daylight.
11888,5,All day he was “downtown”;and in winter it was long after nightfall when she heard his faggedstep on the stairs and his hand on the school-room door.
11889,5,"He wouldkiss her in silence, and ask one or two questions of the nurse orthe governess; then Mrs."
11890,5,"Bart’s maid would come to remind him thathe was dining out, and he would hurry away with a nod to Lily."
11891,5,"Insummer, when he joined them for a Sunday at Newport or Southampton,he was even more effaced and silent than in winter."
11892,5,"It seemedto tire him to rest, and he would sit for hours staring at thesea-line from a quiet corner of the verandah, while the clatter ofhis wife’s existence went on unheeded a few feet off."
11893,5,"Generally,however, Mrs."
11894,5,"Bart and Lily went to Europe for the summer, andbefore the steamer was half way over Mr."
11895,5,Bart had dipped below thehorizon.
11896,5,Sometimes his daughter heard him denounced for havingneglected to forward Mrs.
11897,5,"Bart’s remittances; but for the most parthe was never mentioned or thought of till his patient stoopingfigure presented itself on the New York dock as a buffer betweenthe magnitude of his wife’s luggage and the restrictions of theAmerican custom-house.In this desultory yet agitated fashion life went on through Lily’steens: a zig-zag broken course down which the family craft glidedon a rapid current of amusement, tugged at by the underflow ofa perpetual need—the need of more money."
11898,5,"Lily could not recallthe time when there had been money enough, and in some vague wayher father seemed always to blame for the deficiency."
11899,5,It couldcertainly not be the fault of Mrs.
11900,5,"Bart, who was spoken of by herfriends as a “wonderful manager.” Mrs."
11901,5,"Bart was famous for theunlimited effect she produced on limited means; and to the lady andher acquaintances there was something heroic in living as thoughone were much richer than one’s bank-book denoted.Lily was naturally proud of her mother’s aptitude in this line: shehad been brought up in the faith that, whatever it cost, one musthave a good cook, and be what Mrs."
11902,5,Bart called “decently dressed.”Mrs.
11903,5,"Bart’s worst reproach to her husband was to ask him if heexpected her to “live like a pig”; and his replying in the negativewas always regarded as a justification for cabling to Paris for anextra dress or two, and telephoning to the jeweller that he might,after all, send home the turquoise bracelet which Mrs."
11904,5,"Bart hadlooked at that morning.Lily knew people who “lived like pigs,” and their appearance andsurroundings justified her mother’s repugnance to that form ofexistence."
11905,5,"They were mostly cousins, who inhabited dingy houseswith engravings from Cole’s Voyage of Life on the drawing-roomwalls, and slatternly parlour-maids who said “I’ll go and see”to visitors calling at an hour when all right-minded persons areconventionally if not actually out."
11906,5,"The disgusting part of it wasthat many of these cousins were rich, so that Lily imbibed the ideathat if people lived like pigs it was from choice, and through thelack of any proper standard of conduct."
11907,5,"This gave her a sense ofreflected superiority, and she did not need Mrs."
11908,5,Bart’s comments onthe family frumps and misers to foster her naturally lively tastefor splendour.Lily was nineteen when circumstances caused her to revise her viewof the universe.The previous year she had made a dazzling debut fringed by a heavythunder-cloud of bills.
11909,5,"The light of the debut still lingered onthe horizon, but the cloud had thickened; and suddenly it broke.The suddenness added to the horror; and there were still timeswhen Lily relived with painful vividness every detail of the dayon which the blow fell."
11910,5,"She and her mother had been seated at theluncheon-table, over the CHAUFROIX and cold salmon of the previousnight’s dinner: it was one of Mrs."
11911,5,Bart’s few economies to consumein private the expensive remnants of her hospitality.
11912,5,"Lily wasfeeling the pleasant languor which is youth’s penalty for dancingtill dawn; but her mother, in spite of a few lines about the mouth,and under the yellow waves on her temples, was as alert, determinedand high in colour as if she had risen from an untroubled sleep.In the centre of the table, between the melting MARRONS GLACESand candied cherries, a pyramid of American Beauties lifted theirvigorous stems; they held their heads as high as Mrs."
11913,5,"Bart, buttheir rose-colour had turned to a dissipated purple, and Lily’ssense of fitness was disturbed by their reappearance on theluncheon-table.“I really think, mother,” she said reproachfully, “we mightafford a few fresh flowers for luncheon."
11914,5,Just some jonquils orlilies-of-the-valley—”Mrs.
11915,5,Bart stared.
11916,5,"Her own fastidiousness had its eye fixed on theworld, and she did not care how the luncheon-table looked whenthere was no one present at it but the family."
11917,5,"But she smiled ather daughter’s innocence.“Lilies-of-the-valley,” she said calmly, “cost two dollars a dozenat this season.”Lily was not impressed."
11918,5,"She knew very little of the value of money.“It would not take more than six dozen to fill that bowl,” sheargued.“Six dozen what?” asked her father’s voice in the doorway.The two women looked up in surprise; though it was a Saturday, thesight of Mr."
11919,5,Bart at luncheon was an unwonted one.
11920,5,But neitherhis wife nor his daughter was sufficiently interested to ask anexplanation.Mr.
11921,5,"Bart dropped into a chair, and sat gazing absently at thefragment of jellied salmon which the butler had placed before him.“I was only saying,” Lily began, “that I hate to see faded flowersat luncheon; and mother says a bunch of lilies-of-the-valley wouldnot cost more than twelve dollars."
11922,5,"Mayn’t I tell the florist tosend a few every day?”She leaned confidently toward her father: he seldom refused heranything, and Mrs."
11923,5,Bart had taught her to plead with him when herown entreaties failed.Mr.
11924,5,"Bart sat motionless, his gaze still fixed on the salmon, andhis lower jaw dropped; he looked even paler than usual, and histhin hair lay in untidy streaks on his forehead."
11925,5,Suddenly he lookedat his daughter and laughed.
11926,5,"The laugh was so strange that Lilycoloured under it: she disliked being ridiculed, and her fatherseemed to see something ridiculous in the request."
11927,5,"Perhaps hethought it foolish that she should trouble him about such a trifle.“Twelve dollars—twelve dollars a day for flowers? Oh, certainly, mydear—give him an order for twelve hundred.” He continued to laugh.Mrs."
11928,5,"Bart gave him a quick glance.“You needn’t wait, Poleworth—I will ring for you,” she said to thebutler.The butler withdrew with an air of silent disapproval, leaving theremains of the CHAUFROIX on the sideboard.“What is the matter, Hudson? Are you ill?” said Mrs."
11929,5,"Bart severely.She had no tolerance for scenes which were not of her own making,and it was odious to her that her husband should make a show ofhimself before the servants.“Are you ill?” she repeated.“Ill?—— No, I’m ruined,” he said.Lily made a frightened sound, and Mrs."
11930,5,"Bart rose to her feet.“Ruined——?” she cried; but controlling herself instantly, sheturned a calm face to Lily.“Shut the pantry door,” she said.Lily obeyed, and when she turned back into the room her father wassitting with both elbows on the table, the plate of salmon betweenthem, and his head bowed on his hands.Mrs."
11931,5,Bart stood over him with a white face which made her hairunnaturally yellow.
11932,5,"She looked at Lily as the latter approached:her look was terrible, but her voice was modulated to a ghastlycheerfulness.“Your father is not well—he doesn’t know what he is saying."
11933,5,"Itis nothing—but you had better go upstairs; and don’t talk to theservants,” she added.Lily obeyed; she always obeyed when her mother spoke in thatvoice."
11934,5,She had not been deceived by Mrs.
11935,5,Bart’s words: she knewat once that they were ruined.
11936,5,"In the dark hours which followed,that awful fact overshadowed even her father’s slow and difficultdying."
11937,5,"To his wife he no longer counted: he had become extinctwhen he ceased to fulfil his purpose, and she sat at his sidewith the provisional air of a traveller who waits for a belatedtrain to start."
11938,5,Lily’s feelings were softer: she pitied him in afrightened ineffectual way.
11939,5,"But the fact that he was for the mostpart unconscious, and that his attention, when she stole into theroom, drifted away from her after a moment, made him even more of astranger than in the nursery days when he had never come home tillafter dark."
11940,5,"She seemed always to have seen him through a blur—firstof sleepiness, then of distance and indifference—and now the foghad thickened till he was almost indistinguishable."
11941,5,"If she couldhave performed any little services for him, or have exchanged withhim a few of those affecting words which an extensive perusal offiction had led her to connect with such occasions, the filialinstinct might have stirred in her; but her pity, finding no activeexpression, remained in a state of spectatorship, overshadowed byher mother’s grim unflagging resentment."
11942,5,Every look and act of Mrs.Bart’s seemed to say: “You are sorry for him now—but you will feeldifferently when you see what he has done to us.”It was a relief to Lily when her father died.Then a long winter set in.
11943,5,"There was a little money left, but toMrs."
11944,5,Bart it seemed worse than nothing—the mere mockery of whatshe was entitled to.
11945,5,"What was the use of living if one had to livelike a pig? She sank into a kind of furious apathy, a state ofinert anger against fate."
11946,5,"Her faculty for “managing” deserted her,or she no longer took sufficient pride in it to exert it."
11947,5,"It waswell enough to “manage” when by so doing one could keep one’s owncarriage; but when one’s best contrivance did not conceal the factthat one had to go on foot, the effort was no longer worth making.Lily and her mother wandered from place to place, now paying longvisits to relations whose house-keeping Mrs."
11948,5,"Bart criticized, andwho deplored the fact that she let Lily breakfast in bed when thegirl had no prospects before her, and now vegetating in cheapcontinental refuges, where Mrs."
11949,5,Bart held herself fiercely alooffrom the frugal tea-tables of her companions in misfortune.
11950,5,She wasespecially careful to avoid her old friends and the scenes of herformer successes.
11951,5,"To be poor seemed to her such a confession offailure that it amounted to disgrace; and she detected a note ofcondescension in the friendliest advances.Only one thought consoled her, and that was the contemplation ofLily’s beauty."
11952,5,"She studied it with a kind of passion, as thoughit were some weapon she had slowly fashioned for her vengeance.It was the last asset in their fortunes, the nucleus around whichtheir life was to be rebuilt."
11953,5,"She watched it jealously, as thoughit were her own property and Lily its mere custodian; and shetried to instil into the latter a sense of the responsibility thatsuch a charge involved."
11954,5,"She followed in imagination the careerof other beauties, pointing out to her daughter what might beachieved through such a gift, and dwelling on the awful warning ofthose who, in spite of it, had failed to get what they wanted: toMrs."
11955,5,"Bart, only stupidity could explain the lamentable denouementof some of her examples."
11956,5,"She was not above the inconsistency ofcharging fate, rather than herself, with her own misfortunes; butshe inveighed so acrimoniously against love-matches that Lily wouldhave fancied her own marriage had been of that nature, had not Mrs.Bart frequently assured her that she had been “talked into it”—bywhom, she never made clear.Lily was duly impressed by the magnitude of her opportunities."
11957,5,Thedinginess of her present life threw into enchanting relief theexistence to which she felt herself entitled.
11958,5,To a less illuminatedintelligence Mrs.
11959,5,"Bart’s counsels might have been dangerous; butLily understood that beauty is only the raw material of conquest,and that to convert it into success other arts are required."
11960,5,"Sheknew that to betray any sense of superiority was a subtler form ofthe stupidity her mother denounced, and it did not take her longto learn that a beauty needs more tact than the possessor of anaverage set of features.Her ambitions were not as crude as Mrs."
11961,5,Bart’s.
11962,5,"It had been amongthat lady’s grievances that her husband—in the early days, beforehe was too tired—had wasted his evenings in what she vaguelydescribed as “reading poetry”; and among the effects packed off toauction after his death were a score or two of dingy volumes whichhad struggled for existence among the boots and medicine bottles ofhis dressing-room shelves."
11963,5,"There was in Lily a vein of sentiment,perhaps transmitted from this source, which gave an idealizingtouch to her most prosaic purposes."
11964,5,"She liked to think of herbeauty as a power for good, as giving her the opportunity to attaina position where she should make her influence felt in the vaguediffusion of refinement and good taste."
11965,5,"She was fond of picturesand flowers, and of sentimental fiction, and she could not helpthinking that the possession of such tastes ennobled her desire forworldly advantages."
11966,5,She would not indeed have cared to marry a manwho was merely rich: she was secretly ashamed of her mother’s crudepassion for money.
11967,5,"Lily’s preference would have been for an Englishnobleman with political ambitions and vast estates; or, for secondchoice, an Italian prince with a castle in the Apennines and anhereditary office in the Vatican."
11968,5,"Lost causes had a romantic charmfor her, and she liked to picture herself as standing aloof fromthe vulgar press of the Quirinal, and sacrificing her pleasure tothe claims of an immemorial tradition....How long ago and how far off it all seemed! Those ambitions werehardly more futile and childish than the earlier ones which hadcentred about the possession of a French jointed doll with realhair."
11969,5,Was it only ten years since she had wavered in imaginationbetween the English earl and the Italian prince? Relentlessly hermind travelled on over the dreary interval....After two years of hungry roaming Mrs.
11970,5,Bart had died——died of adeep disgust.
11971,5,"She had hated dinginess, and it was her fate to bedingy."
11972,5,Her visions of a brilliant marriage for Lily had faded afterthe first year.“People can’t marry you if they don’t see you—and how can they seeyou in these holes where we’re stuck?” That was the burden of herlament; and her last adjuration to her daughter was to escape fromdinginess if she could.“Don’t let it creep up on you and drag you down.
11973,5,"Fight your way outof it somehow—you’re young and can do it,” she insisted.She had died during one of their brief visits to New York, andthere Lily at once became the centre of a family council composedof the wealthy relatives whom she had been taught to despisefor living like pigs."
11974,5,"It may be that they had an inkling of thesentiments in which she had been brought up, for none of themmanifested a very lively desire for her company; indeed, thequestion threatened to remain unsolved till Mrs."
11975,5,"Peniston with asigh announced: “I’ll try her for a year.”Every one was surprised, but one and all concealed their surprise,lest Mrs."
11976,5,Peniston should be alarmed by it into reconsidering herdecision.Mrs.
11977,5,Peniston was Mr.
11978,5,"Bart’s widowed sister, and if she was byno means the richest of the family group, its other membersnevertheless abounded in reasons why she was clearly destined byProvidence to assume the charge of Lily."
11979,5,"In the first place she wasalone, and it would be charming for her to have a young companion.Then she sometimes travelled, and Lily’s familiarity with foreigncustoms—deplored as a misfortune by her more conservativerelatives—would at least enable her to act as a kind of courier.But as a matter of fact Mrs."
11980,5,Peniston had not been affected bythese considerations.
11981,5,"She had taken the girl simply because no oneelse would have her, and because she had the kind of moral MAUVAISEHONTE which makes the public display of selfishness difficult,though it does not interfere with its private indulgence."
11982,5,It wouldhave been impossible for Mrs.
11983,5,"Peniston to be heroic on a desertisland, but with the eyes of her little world upon her she took acertain pleasure in her act.She reaped the reward to which disinterestedness is entitled,and found an agreeable companion in her niece."
11984,5,"She had expectedto find Lily headstrong, critical and “foreign”—for even Mrs.Peniston, though she occasionally went abroad, had the family dreadof foreignness—but the girl showed a pliancy, which, to a morepenetrating mind than her aunt’s, might have been less reassuringthan the open selfishness of youth."
11985,5,"Misfortune had made Lily suppleinstead of hardening her, and a pliable substance is less easy tobreak than a stiff one.Mrs."
11986,5,"Peniston, however, did not suffer from her niece’sadaptability."
11987,5,Lily had no intention of taking advantage of heraunt’s good-nature.
11988,5,She was in truth grateful for the refugeoffered her: Mrs.
11989,5,Peniston’s opulent interior was at least notexternally dingy.
11990,5,But dinginess is a quality which assumes allmanner of disguises; and Lily soon found that it was as latentin the expensive routine of her aunt’s life as in the makeshiftexistence of a continental pension.Mrs.
11991,5,Peniston was one of the episodical persons who form thepadding of life.
11992,5,It was impossible to believe that she had herselfever been a focus of activities.
11993,5,The most vivid thing about herwas the fact that her grandmother had been a Van Alstyne.
11994,5,Thisconnection with the well-fed and industrious stock of early NewYork revealed itself in the glacial neatness of Mrs.
11995,5,Peniston’sdrawing-room and i.
11996,6,The first sound in the mornings was the clumping of the mill-girls' clogsdown the cobbled street.
11997,6,"Earlier than that, I suppose, there were factorywhistles which I was never awake to hear.There were generally four of us in the bedroom, and a beastly place itwas, with that defiled impermanent look of rooms that are not servingtheir rightful purpose."
11998,6,"Years earlier the house had been an ordinarydwelling-house, and when the Brookers had taken it and fitted it out asa tripe-shop and lodging-house, they had inherited some of the moreuseless pieces of furniture and had never had the energy to remove them.We were therefore sleeping in what was still recognizably adrawing-room."
11999,6,Hanging from the ceiling there was a heavy glasschandelier on which the dust was so thick that it was like fur.
12000,6,"Andcovering most of one wall there was a huge hideous piece of junk,something between a sideboard and a hall-stand, with lots of carving andlittle drawers and strips of looking-glass, and there was a once-gaudycarpet ringed by the slop-pails of years, and two gilt chairs with burstseats, and one of those old-fashioned horsehair armchairs which youslide off when you try to sit on them."
12001,6,The room had been turned into abedroom by thrusting four squalid beds in among this other wreckage.My bed was in the right-hand corner on the side nearest the door.
12002,6,Therewas another bed across the foot of it and jammed hard against it (it hadto be in that position to allow the door to open) so that I had to sleepwith my legs doubled up; if I straightened them out I kicked theoccupant of the other bed in the small of the back.
12003,6,"He was an elderlyman named Mr Reilly, a mechanic of sorts and employed 'on top' at one ofthe coal pits."
12004,6,"Luckily he had to go to work at five in the morning, so Icould uncoil my legs and have a couple of hours' proper sleep after hewas gone."
12005,6,"In the bed opposite there was a Scotch miner who had beeninjured in a pit accident (a huge chunk of stone pinned him to theground and it was a couple of hours before they could lever it off), andhad received five hundred pounds compensation."
12006,6,"He was a big handsome manof forty, with grizzled hair and a clipped moustache, more like asergeant-major than a miner, and he would lie in bed till late in theday, smoking a short pipe."
12007,6,"The other bed was occupied by a succession ofcommercial travellers, newspaper-canvassers, and hire-purchase touts whogenerally stayed for a couple of nights."
12008,6,It was a double bed and muchthe best in the room.
12009,6,"I had slept in it myself my first night there, buthad been manoeuvred out of it to make room for another lodger."
12010,6,"I believeall newcomers spent their first night in the double bed, which was used,so to speak, as bait."
12011,6,"All the windows were kept tight shut, with a redsandbag jammed in the bottom, and in the morning the room stank like aferret's cage."
12012,6,"You did not notice it when you got up, but if you wentout of the room and came back, the smell hit you in the face with asmack.I never discovered how many bedrooms the house contained, but strange tosay there was a bathroom, dating from before the Brookers' time.Downstairs there was the usual kitchen living-room with its huge openrange burning night and day."
12013,6,"It was lighted only by a skylight, for onone side of it was the shop and on the other the larder, which openedinto some dark subterranean place where the tripe was stored."
12014,6,"Partlyblocking the door of the larder there was a shapeless sofa upon whichMrs Brooker, our landlady, lay permanently ill, festooned in grimyblankets."
12015,6,"She had a big, pale yellow, anxious face."
12016,6,No one knew forcertain what was the matter with her; I suspect that her only realtrouble was over-eating.
12017,6,"In front of the fire there was almost always aline of damp washing, and in the middle of the room was the big kitchentable at which the family and all the lodgers ate."
12018,6,"I never saw thistable completely uncovered, but I saw its various wrappings at differenttimes."
12019,6,"At the bottom there was a layer of old newspaper stained byWorcester Sauce; above that a sheet of sticky white oil-cloth; abovethat a green serge cloth; above that a coarse linen cloth, never changedand seldom taken off."
12020,6,Generally the crumbs from breakfast were still onthe table at supper.
12021,6,"I used to get to know individual crumbs by sightand watch their progress up and down the table from day to day.The shop was a narrow, cold sort of room."
12022,6,"On the outside of the windowa few white letters, relics of ancient chocolate advertisements, werescattered like stars."
12023,6,"Inside there was a slab upon which lay the greatwhite folds of tripe, and the grey flocculent stuff known as 'blacktripe', and the ghostly translucent feet of pigs, ready boiled."
12024,6,"It wasthe ordinary 'tripe and pea' shop, and not much else was stocked exceptbread, cigarettes, and tinned stuff."
12025,6,"'Teas' were advertised in thewindow, but if a customer demanded a cup of tea he was usually put offwith excuses."
12026,6,"Mr Brooker, though out of work for two years, was a minerby trade, but he and his wife had been keeping shops of various kinds asa side-line all their lives."
12027,6,"At one time they had had a pub, but theyhad lost their licence for allowing gambling on the premises."
12028,6,I doubtwhether any of their businesses had ever paid; they were the kind ofpeople who run a business chiefly in order to have something to grumbleabout.
12029,6,"Mr Brooker was a dark, small-boned, sour, Irish-looking man, andastonishingly dirty."
12030,6,I don't think I ever once saw his hands clean.
12031,6,"AsMrs Brooker was now an invalid he prepared most of the food, and likeall people with permanently dirty hands he had a peculiarly intimate,lingering manner of handling things."
12032,6,If he gave you a slice ofbread-and-butter there was always a black thumb-print on it.
12033,6,"Even in theearly morning when he descended into the mysterious den behind MrsBrooker's sofa and fished out the tripe, his hands were already black."
12034,6,Iheard dreadful stories from the other lodgers about the place where thetripe was kept.
12035,6,Blackbeetles were said to swarm there.
12036,6,"I do not know howoften fresh consignments of tripe were ordered, but it was at longintervals, for Mrs Brooker used to date events by it."
12037,6,"'Let me see now,I've had in three lots of froze (frozen tripe) since that happened,'etc."
12038,6,We lodgers were never given tripe to eat.
12039,6,At the time I imaginedthat this was because tripe was too expensive; I have since thought thatit was merely because we knew too much about it.
12040,6,"The Brookers never atetripe themselves, I noticed.The only permanent lodgers were the Scotch miner, Mr Reilly, two old-agepensioners, and an unemployed man on the P.A.C."
12041,6,named Joe--he was thekind of person who has no surname.
12042,6,The Scotch miner was a bore when yougot to know him.
12043,6,"Like so many unemployed men he spent too much timereading newspapers, and if you did not head him off he would discoursefor hours about such things as the Yellow Peril, trunk murders,astrology, and the conflict between religion and science."
12044,6,"The old-agepensioners had, as usual, been driven from their homes by the MeansTest."
12045,6,"They handed their weekly ten shillings over to the Brookers and inreturn got the kind of accommodation you would expect for ten shillings;that is, a bed in the attic and meals chiefly of bread-and-butter."
12046,6,"Oneof them was of 'superior' type and was dying of some malignantdisease--cancer, I believe."
12047,6,He only got out of bed on the days when hewent to draw his pension.
12048,6,"The other, called by everyone Old Jack, was anex-miner aged seventy-eight who had worked well over fifty years in thepits."
12049,6,"He was alert and intelligent, but curiously enough he seemed onlyto remember his boyhood experiences and to have forgotten all about themodern mining machinery and improvements."
12050,6,He used to tell me tales offights with savage horses in the narrow galleries underground.
12051,6,When heheard that I was arranging to go down several coal mines he wascontemptuous and declared that a man of my size (six feet two and ahalf) would never manage the 'travelling'; it was no use telling himthat the 'travelling' was better than it used to be.
12052,6,"But he was friendlyto everyone and used to give us all a fine shout of 'Good night, boys!'as he crawled up the stairs to his bed somewhere under the rafters."
12053,6,"WhatI most admired about Old Jack was that he never cadged; he was generallyout-of tobacco towards the end of the week, but he always refused tosmoke anyone else's."
12054,6,The Brookers had insured the lives of both old-agepensioners with one of the tanner-a-week companies.
12055,6,"It was said thatthey were overheard anxiously asking the insurance-tout 'how long peoplelives when they've got cancer'.Joe, like the Scotchman, was a great reader of newspapers and spentalmost his entire day in the public library."
12056,6,"He was the typicalunmarried unemployed man, a derelict-looking, frankly ragged creaturewith a round, almost childish face on which there was a naively naughtyexpression."
12057,6,He looked more like a neglected little boy than a grown-upman.
12058,6,I suppose it is the complete lack of responsibility that makes somany of these men look younger than their ages.
12059,6,"From Joe's appearance Itook him to be about twenty-eight, and was amazed to learn that he wasforty-three."
12060,6,He had a love of resounding phrases and was very proud ofthe astuteness with which he had avoided getting married.
12061,6,"He often saidto me, 'Matrimonial chains is a big item,' evidently feeling this to bea very subtle and portentous remark."
12062,6,"His total income was fifteenshillings a week, and he paid out six or seven to the Brookers for hisbed."
12063,6,"I sometimes used to see him making himself a cup of tea over thekitchen fire, but for the rest he got his meals somewhere out of doors;it was mostly slices of bread-and-marg and packets of fish and chips, Isuppose.Besides these there was a floating clientele of commercial travellers ofthe poorer sort, travelling actors--always common in the North becausemost of the larger pubs hire variety artists at the week-ends--andnewspaper-canvassers."
12064,6,The newspaper-canvassers were a type I had nevermet before.
12065,6,"Their job seemed to me so hopeless, so appalling that Iwondered how anyone could put up with such a thing when prison was apossible alternative."
12066,6,"They were employed mostly by weekly or Sundaypapers, and they were sent from town to town, provided with maps andgiven a list of streets which they had to 'work' each day."
12067,6,"If theyfailed to secure a minimum of twenty orders a day, they got the sack."
12068,6,"Solong as they kept up their twenty orders a day they received a smallsalary--two pounds a week, I think; on any order over the twenty theydrew a tiny commission."
12069,6,"The thing is not so impossible as it sounds,because in working-class districts every family takes in a twopennyweekly paper and changes it every few weeks; but I doubt whether anyonekeeps a job of that kind long."
12070,6,"The newspapers engage poor desperatewretches, out-of-work clerks and commercial travellers and the like, whofor a while make frantic efforts and keep their sales up to the minimum;then as the deadly work wears them down they are sacked and fresh menare taken on."
12071,6,I got to know two who were employed by one of the morenotorious weeklies.
12072,6,"Both of them were middle-aged men with families tosupport, and one of them was a grandfather."
12073,6,"They were on their feet tenhours a day, 'working' their appointed streets, and then busy late intothe night filling in blank forms for some swindle their paper wasrunning--one of those schemes by which you are 'given' a set of crockeryif you take out a six weeks' subscription and send a two-shilling postalorder as well."
12074,6,"The fat one, the grandfather, used to fall asleep withhis head on a pile of forms."
12075,6,Neither of them could afford the pound aweek which the Brookers charged for full board.
12076,6,"They used to pay a smallsum for their beds and make shamefaced meals in a corner of the kitchenoff bacon and bread-and-margarine which they stored in theirsuit-cases.The Brookers had large numbers of sons and daughters, most of whom hadlong since fled from home."
12077,6,"Some were in Canada 'at Canada', as MrsBrooker used to put it."
12078,6,"There was only one son living near by, a largepig-like young man employed in a garage, who frequently came to thehouse for his meals."
12079,6,"His wife was there all day with the two children,and most of the cooking and laundering was done by her and by Emmie, thefiancee of another son who was in London."
12080,6,"Emmie was a fair-haired,sharp-nosed, unhappy-looking girl who worked at one of the mills forsome starvation wage, but nevertheless spent all her evenings in bondageat the Brookers' house."
12081,6,"I gathered that the marriage was constantlybeing postponed and would probably never take place, but Mrs Brooker hadalready appropriated Emmie as a daughter-in-law, and nagged her in thatpeculiar watchful, loving way that invalids have."
12082,6,"The rest of thehousework was done, or not done, by Mr Brooker."
12083,6,Mrs Brooker seldom rosefrom her sofa in the kitchen (she spent the night there as well as theday) and was too ill to do anything except eat stupendous meals.
12084,6,"It wasMr Brooker who attended to the shop, gave the lodgers their food, and'did out' the bedrooms."
12085,6,He was always moving with incredible slownessfrom one hated job to another.
12086,6,"Often the beds were still unmade at sixin the evening, and at any hour of the day you were liable to meet MrBrooker on the stairs, carrying a full chamber-pot which he gripped withhis thumb well over the rim."
12087,6,"In the mornings he sat by the fire with atub of filthy water, peeling potatoes at the speed of a slow-motionpicture."
12088,6,I never saw anyone who could peel potatoes with quite such anair of brooding resentment.
12089,6,"You could see the hatred of this 'bloodywoman's work', as he called it, fermenting inside him, a kind of bitterjuice."
12090,6,"He was one of those people who can chew their grievances like acud.Of course, as I was indoors a good deal, I heard all about the Brookers'woes, and how everyone swindled them and was ungrateful to them, and howthe shop did not pay and the lodging-house hardly paid."
12091,6,"By localstandards they were not so badly off, for, in some way I did notunderstand, Mr Brooker was dodging the Means Test and drawing anallowance from the P.A.C., but their chief pleasure was talking abouttheir grievances to anyone who would listen."
12092,6,"Mrs Brooker used to lamentby the hour, lying on her sofa, a soft mound of fat and self-pity,saying the same things over and over again.' We don't seem to get nocustomers nowadays."
12093,6,I don't know 'ow it is.
12094,6,"The tripe's just a-layingthere day after day--such beautiful tripe it is, too! It does seem 'ard,don't it now?' etc., etc., etc."
12095,6,"All Mrs Brookers' laments ended with'It does seem 'ard, don't it now?' like the refrain of a ballade.Certainly it was true that the shop did not pay."
12096,6,"The whole place had theunmistakable dusty, flyblown air of a business that is going down."
12097,6,"Butit would have been quite useless to explain to them _why_ nobody came tothe shop, even if one had had the face to do it; neither was capable ofunderstanding that last year's dead bluebottles supine in the shopwindow are not good for trade.But the thing that really tormented them was the thought of those twoold-age pensioners living in their house, usurping floor-space,devouring food, and paying only ten shillings a week."
12098,6,"I doubt whetherthey were really losing money over the old-age pensioners, thoughcertainly the profit on ten shillings a week must have been very small.But in their eyes the two old men were a kind of dreadful parasite whohad fastened on them and were living on their charity."
12099,6,"Old Jack theycould just tolerate, because he kept out-of-doors most of the day, butthey really hated the bedridden one, Hooker by name."
12100,6,"Mr Brooker had aqueer way of pronouncing his name, without the H and with a longU--'Uker'."
12101,6,"What tales I heard about old Hooker and his fractiousness,the nuisance of making his bed, the way he 'wouldn't eat' this and'wouldn't eat' that, his endless ingratitude and, above all, the selfishobstinacy with which he refused to die! The Brookers were quite openlypining for him to die."
12102,6,When that happened they could at least draw theinsurance money.
12103,6,"They seemed to feel him there, eating their substanceday after day, as though he had been a living worm in their bowels.Sometimes Mr Brooker would look up from his potato-peeling, catch myeye, and jerk his head with a look of inexpressible bitterness towardsthe ceiling, towards old Hooker's room."
12104,6,"'It's a b-, ain't it?' he wouldsay."
12105,6,There was no need to say more; I had heard all about old Hooker'sways already.
12106,6,"But the Brookers had grievances of one kind and anotheragainst all their lodgers, myself included, no doubt."
12107,6,"Joe, being on theP.A.C., was practically in the same category as the old-age pensioners.The Scotchman paid a pound a week, but he was indoors most of the dayand they 'didn't like him always hanging round the place', as they putit."
12108,6,"The newspaper-canvassers were out all day, but the Brookers borethem a grudge for bringing in their own food, and even Mr Reilly, theirbest lodger, was in disgrace because Mrs Brooker said that he woke herup when he came downstairs in the mornings."
12109,6,"They couldn't, theycomplained perpetually, get the kind of lodgers they wanted--good-class'commercial gentlemen' who paid full board and were out all day."
12110,6,Theirideal lodger would have been somebody who paid thirty shillings a weekand never came indoors except to sleep.
12111,6,I have noticed that people wholet lodgings nearly always hate their lodgers.
12112,6,"They want their money butthey look on them as intruders and have a curiously watchful, jealousattitude which at bottom is a determination not to let the lodger makehimself too much at home."
12113,6,It is an inevitable result of the bad systemby which the lodger has to live in somebody else's house without beingone of the family.The meals at the Brookers' house were uniformly disgusting.
12114,6,"Forbreakfast you got two rashers of bacon and a pale fried egg, andbread-and-butter which had often been cut overnight and always hadthumb-marks on it."
12115,6,"However tactfully I tried, I could never induce MrBrooker to let me cut my own bread-and-butter; he _would_ hand it to meslice by slice, each slice gripped firmly under that broad black thumbs.For dinner there were generally those threepenny steak puddings whichare sold ready-made in tins--these were part of the stock of the shop, Ithink--and boiled potatoes and rice pudding."
12116,6,For tea there was morebread-and-butter and frayed-looking sweet cakes which were probablybought as 'stales' from the baker.
12117,6,For supper there was the pale flabbyLancashire cheese and biscuits.
12118,6,The Brookers never called these biscuitsbiscuits.
12119,6,"They always referred to them reverently as 'creamcrackers'--'Have another cream cracker, Mr Reilly."
12120,6,You'll like a creamcracker with your cheese'--thus glozing over the fact that there wasonly cheese for supper.
12121,6,Several bottles of Worcester Sauce and ahalf-full jar of marmalade lived permanently on the table.
12122,6,"It was usualto souse everything, even a piece of cheese, with Worcester Sauce, but Inever saw anyone brave the marmalade jar, which was an unspeakable massof stickiness and dust."
12123,6,"Mrs Brooker had her meals separately but alsotook snacks from any meal that happened to be going, and manoeuvred withgreat skill for what she called 'the bottom of the pot', meaning thestrongest cup of tea."
12124,6,She had a habit of constantly wiping her mouth onone of her blankets.
12125,6,"Towards the end of my stay she took to tearing offstrips of newspaper for this purpose, and in the morning the floor wasoften littered with crumpled-up balls of slimy paper which lay there forhours."
12126,6,"The smell of the kitchen was dreadful, but, as with that of thebedroom, you ceased to notice it after a while.It struck me that this place must be fairly normal as lodging-houses inthe industrial areas go, for on the whole the lodgers did not complain.The only one who ever did so to my knowledge was a little black-haired,sharp-nosed Cockney, a traveller for a cigarette firm."
12127,6,"He had never beenin the North before, and I think that till recently he had been inbetter employ and was used to staying in commercial hotels."
12128,6,"This was hisfirst glimpse of really low-class lodgings, the kind of place in whichthe poor tribe of touts and canvassers have to shelter upon theirendless journeys."
12129,6,"In the morning as we were dressing (he had slept inthe double bed, of course) I saw him look round the desolate room with asort of wondering aversion."
12130,6,He caught my eye and suddenly divined that Iwas a fellow-Southerner.
12131,6,'The filthy bloody bastards!' he saidfeelingly.
12132,6,"After that he packed his suit-case, went downstairs and, withgreat strength of mind, told the Brookers that this was not the kind ofhouse he was accustomed to and that he was leaving immediately."
12133,6,TheBrookers could never understand why.
12134,6,They were astonished and hurt.
12135,6,"Theingratitude of it! Leaving them like that for no reason after a singlenight! Afterwards they discussed it over and over again, in all itsbearings."
12136,6,It was added to their store of grievances.On the day when there was a full chamber-pot under the breakfast table Idecided to leave.
12137,6,The place was beginning to depress me.
12138,6,"It was not onlythe dirt, the smells, and the vile food, but the feeling of stagnantmeaningless decay, of having got down into some subterranean place wherepeople go creeping round and round, just like blackbeetles, in anendless muddle of slovened jobs and mean grievances."
12139,6,The most dreadfulthing about people like the Brookers is the way they say the same thingsover and over again.
12140,6,"It gives you the feeling that they are not realpeople at all, but a kind of ghost for ever rehearsing the same futilerigmarole."
12141,6,"In the end Mrs Brooker's self-pitying talk--always the samecomplaints, over and over, and always ending with the tremulous whine of'It does seem 'ard, don't it now?'--revolted me even more than her habitof wiping her mouth with bits of newspaper."
12142,6,But it is no use saying thatpeople like the Brookers are just disgusting and trying to put them outof mind.
12143,6,For they exist in tens and hundreds of thousands; they are oneof the characteristic by-products of the modern world.
12144,6,You cannotdisregard them if you accept the civilization that produced them.
12145,6,Forthis is part at least of what industrialism has done for us.
12146,6,"Columbussailed the Atlantic, the first steam engines tottered into motion, theBritish squares stood firm under the French guns at Waterloo, theone-eyed scoundrels of the nineteenth century praised God and filledtheir pockets; and this is where it all led--to labyrinthine slums anddark back kitchens with sickly, ageing people creeping round and roundthem like blackbeetles."
12147,6,"It is a kind of duty to see and smell suchplaces now and again, especially smell them, lest you should forget thatthey exist; though perhaps it is better not to stay there too long.The train bore me away, through the monstrous scenery of slag-heaps,chimneys, piled scrap-iron, foul canals, paths of cindery mudcriss-crossed by the prints of clogs."
12148,6,"This was March, but the weatherhad been horribly cold and everywhere there were mounds of blackenedsnow."
12149,6,As we moved slowly through the outskirts of the town we passed rowafter row of little grey slum houses running at right angles tothe-embankment.
12150,6,"At the back of one of the houses a young woman waskneeling on the stones, poking a stick up the leaden waste-pipe whichran from the sink inside and which I suppose was blocked."
12151,6,"I had time tosee everything about her--her sacking apron, her clumsy clogs, her armsreddened by the cold."
12152,6,"She looked up as the train passed, and I wasalmost near enough to catch her eye."
12153,6,"She had a round pale face, theusual exhausted face of the slum girl who is twenty-five and looksforty, thanks to miscarriages and drudgery; and it wore, for the secondin which I saw it, the most desolate, hopeless expression I haveever seen."
12154,6,"It struck me then that we are mistaken when we say that 'Itisn't the same for them as it would be for us,' and that people bred inthe slums can imagine nothing but the slums."
12155,6,For what I saw in her facewas not the ignorant suffering of an animal.
12156,6,"She knew well enough whatwas happening to her--understood as well as I did how dreadful a destinyit was to be kneeling there in the bitter cold, on the slimy stones of aslum backyard, poking a stick up a foul drain-pipe.But quite soon the train drew away into open country, and that seemedstrange, almost unnatural, as though the open country had been a kind ofpark; for in the industrial areas one always feels that the smoke andfilth must go on for ever and that no part of the earth's surface canescape them."
12157,6,"In a crowded, dirty little country like ours one takesdefilement almost for granted."
12158,6,"Slag-heaps and chimneys seem a morenormal, probable landscape than grass and trees, and even in the depthsof the country when you drive your fork into the ground you half expectto lever up a broken bottle or a rusty can."
12159,6,"But out here the snow wasuntrodden and lay so deep that only the tops of the stone boundary-wallswere showing, winding over the hills like black paths."
12160,6,I remembered thatD.
12161,6,H.
12162,6,"Lawrence, writing of this same landscape or another near by, saidthat the snow-covered hills rippled away into the distance 'likemuscle'."
12163,6,It was not the simile that would have occurred to me.
12164,6,"To my eyethe snow and the black walls were more like a white dress with blackpiping running across it.Although the snow was hardly broken the sun was shining brightly, andbehind the shut windows of the carriage it seemed warm."
12165,6,"According to thealmanac this was spring, and a few of the birds seemed to believe it.For the first time in my life, in a bare patch beside the line, I sawrooks treading."
12166,6,"They did it on the ground and not, as I should haveexpected, in a tree."
12167,6,The manner of courtship was curious.
12168,6,The femalestood with her beak open and the male walked round her and appeared tobe feeding her.
12169,6,"I had hardly been in the train half an hour, but itseemed a very long way from the Brookers' back-kitchen to the emptyslopes of snow, the bright sunshine, and the big gleaming birds.The whole of the industrial districts are really one enormous town, ofabout the same population as Greater London but, fortunately, of muchlarger area; so that even in the middle of them there is still room forpatches of cleanness and decency."
12170,6,That is an encouraging thought.
12171,6,"Inspite of hard trying, man has not yet succeeded in doing his dirteverywhere."
12172,6,The earth is so vast and still so empty that even in thefilthy heart of civilization you find fields where the grass is greeninstead of grey; perhaps if you looked for them you might even findstreams with live fish in them instead of salmon tins.
12173,6,"For quite a longtime, perhaps another twenty minutes, the train was rolling through opencountry before the villa-civilization began to close in upon us again,and then the outer slums, and then the slag-heaps, belching chimneys,blast-furnaces, canals, and gaso-meters of another industrial town."
12174,6," 2Our civilization, _pace_ Chesterton, is founded on coal, more completelythan one realizes until one stops to think about it."
12175,6,"The machines thatkeep us alive, and the machines that make machines, are all directly orindirectly dependent upon coal."
12176,6,In the metabolism of the Western worldthe coal-miner is second in importance only to the man who ploughs thesoil.
12177,6,He is a sort of caryatid upon whose shoulders nearly everythingthat is not grimy is supported.
12178,6,"For this reason the actual process bywhich coal is extracted is well worth watching, if you get the chanceand are willing to take the trouble.When you go down a coal-mine it is important to try and get to the coalface when the 'fillers' are at work."
12179,6,"This is not easy, because when themine is working visitors are a nuisance and are not encouraged, but ifyou go at any other time, it is possible to come away with a totallywrong impression."
12180,6,"On a Sunday, for instance, a mine seems almostpeaceful."
12181,6,"The time to go there is when the machines are roaring and theair is black with coal dust, and when you can actually see what theminers have to do."
12182,6,"At those times the place is like hell, or at any ratelike my own mental picture of hell."
12183,6,"Most of the things one imagines inhell are if there--heat, noise, confusion, darkness, foul air, and,above all, unbearably cramped space."
12184,6,"Everything except the fire, forthere is no fire down there except the feeble beams of Davy lamps andelectric torches which scarcely penetrate the clouds of coal dust.When you have finally got there--and getting there is a job in itself: Iwill explain that in a moment--you crawl through the last line of pitprops and see opposite you a shiny black wall three or four feet high.This is the coal face."
12185,6,"Overhead is the smooth ceiling made by the rockfrom which the coal has been cut; underneath is the rock again, so thatthe gallery you are in is only as high as the ledge of coal itself,probably not much more than a yard."
12186,6,"The first impression of all,overmastering everything else for a while, is the frightful, deafeningdin from the conveyor belt which carries the coal away."
12187,6,"You cannot seevery far, because the fog of coal dust throws back the beam of yourlamp, but you can see on either side of you the line of half-nakedkneeling men, one to every four or five yards, driving their shovelsunder the fallen coal and flinging it swiftly over their left shoulders.They are feeding it on to the conveyor belt, a moving rubber belt acouple of feet wide which runs a yard or two behind them."
12188,6,Down this belta glittering river of coal races constantly.
12189,6,In a big mine it iscarrying away several tons of coal every minute.
12190,6,"It bears it off to someplace in the main roads where it is shot into tubs holding half a ton,and thence dragged to the cages and hoisted to the outer air.It is impossible to watch the 'fillers' at work without feeling a pangof envy for their toughness."
12191,6,"It is a dreadful job that they do, analmost superhuman job by the standard of an ordinary person."
12192,6,"For theyare not only shifting monstrous quantities of coal, they are also doingit in a position that doubles or trebles the work."
12193,6,They have got toremain kneeling all the while--they could hardly rise from their kneeswithout hitting the ceiling--and you can easily see by trying it what atremendous effort this means.
12194,6,"Shovelling is comparatively easy when youare standing up, because you can use your knee and thigh to drive theshovel along; kneeling down, the whole of the strain is thrown upon yourarm and belly muscles."
12195,6,And the other conditions do not exactly makethings easier.
12196,6,"There is the heat--it varies, but in some mines it issuffocating--and the coal dust that stuffs up your throat and nostrilsand collects along your eyelids, and the unending rattle of the conveyorbelt, which in that confined space is rather like the rattle of amachine gun."
12197,6,But the fillers look and work as though they were made ofiron.
12198,6,They really do look like iron hammered iron statues--under thesmooth coat of coal dust which clings to them from head to foot.
12199,6,It isonly when you see miners down the mine and naked that you realize whatsplendid men they are.
12200,6,"Most of them are small (big men are at adisadvantage in that job) but nearly all of them have the most noblebodies; wide shoulders tapering to slender supple waists, and smallpronounced buttocks and sinewy thighs, with not an ounce of waste fleshanywhere."
12201,6,"In the hotter mines they wear only a pair of thin drawers,clogs and knee-pads; in the hottest mines of all, only the clogs andknee-pads."
12202,6,You can hardly tell by the look of them whether they areyoung or old.
12203,6,"They may be any age up to sixty or even sixty-five, butwhen they are black and naked they all look alike."
12204,6,"No one could do theirwork who had not a young man's body, and a figure fit for a guardsman atthat, just a few pounds of extra flesh on the waist-line, and theconstant bending would be impossible."
12205,6,"You can never forget thatspectacle once you have seen it--the line of bowed, kneeling figures,sooty black all over, driving their huge shovels under the coal withstupendous force and speed."
12206,6,"They are on the job for seven and a halfhours, theoretically without a break, for there is no time 'off'.Actually they snatch a quarter of an hour or so at some time during theshift to eat the food they have brought with them, usually a hunk ofbread and dripping and a bottle of cold tea."
12207,6,The first time I waswatching the 'fillers' at work I put my hand upon some dreadful slimything among the coal dust.
12208,6,It was a chewed quid of tobacco.
12209,6,"Nearly allthe miners chew tobacco, which is said to be good against thirst.Probably you have to go down several coal-mines before you can get muchgrasp of the processes that are going on round you."
12210,6,This is chieflybecause the mere effort of getting from place to place makes itdifficult to notice anything else.
12211,6,"In some ways it is evendisappointing, or at least is unlike what you have, expected."
12212,6,"You getinto the cage, which is a steel box about as wide as a telephone box andtwo or three times as long."
12213,6,"It holds ten men, but they pack it likepilchards in a tin, and a tall man cannot stand upright in it."
12214,6,"The steeldoor shuts upon you, and somebody working the winding gear above dropsyou into the void."
12215,6,"You have the usual momentary qualm in your belly anda bursting sensation in the cars, but not much sensation of movementtill you get near the bottom, when the cage slows down so abruptly thatyou could swear it is going upwards again."
12216,6,In the middle of the run thecage probably touches sixty miles an hour; in some of the deeper minesit touches even more.
12217,6,When you crawl out at the bottom you are perhapsfour hundred yards underground.
12218,6,"That is to say you have atolerable-sized mountain on top of you; hundreds of yards of solid rock,bones of extinct beasts, subsoil, flints, roots of growing things, greengrass and cows grazing on it--all this suspended over your head and heldback only by wooden props as thick as the calf of your leg."
12219,6,"But becauseof the speed at which the cage has brought you down, and the completeblackness through which you have travelled, you hardly feel yourselfdeeper down than you would at the bottom of the Piccadilly tube.What is surprising, on the other hand, is the immense horizontaldistances that have to be travelled underground."
12220,6,Before I had been downa mine I had vaguely imagined the miner stepping out of the cage andgetting to work on a ledge of coal a few yards away.
12221,6,I had not realizedthat before he even gets to work he may have had to creep along passagesas long as from London Bridge to Oxford Circus.
12222,6,"In the beginning, ofcourse, a mine shaft is sunk somewhere near a seam of coal; But as thatseam is worked out and fresh seams are followed up, the workings getfurther and further from the pit bottom."
12223,6,"If it is a mile from the pitbottom to the coal face, that is probably an average distance; threemiles is a fairly normal one; there are even said to be a few mineswhere it is as much as five miles."
12224,6,But these distances bear no relationto distances above ground.
12225,6,"For in all that mile or three miles as it maybe, there is hardly anywhere outside the main road, and not many placeseven there, where a man can stand upright.You do not notice the effect of this till you have gone a few hundredyards."
12226,6,"You start off, stooping slightly, down the dim-lit gallery, eightor ten feet wide and about five high, with the walls built up with slabsof shale, like the stone walls in Derbyshire."
12227,6,Every yard or two thereare wooden props holding up the beams and girders; some of the girdershave buckled into fantastic curves under which you have to duck.
12228,6,"Usuallyit is bad going underfoot--thick dust or jagged chunks of shale, and insome mines where there is water it is as mucky as a farm-yard."
12229,6,"Alsothere is the track for the coal tubs, like a miniature railway trackwith sleepers a foot or two apart, which is tiresome to walk on.Everything is grey with shale dust; there is a dusty fiery smell whichseems to be the same in all mines."
12230,6,"You see mysterious machines of whichyou never learn the purpose, and bundles of tools slung together onwires, and sometimes mice darting away from the beam of the lamps."
12231,6,"Theyare surprisingly common, especially in mines where there are or havebeen horses."
12232,6,"It would be interesting to know how they got there in thefirst place; possibly by falling down the shaft--for they say a mousecan fall any distance uninjured, owing to its surface area being solarge relative to its weight."
12233,6,"You press yourself against the wall tomake way for lines of tubs jolting slowly towards the shaft, drawn by anendless steel cable operated from the surface."
12234,6,"You creep through sackingcurtains and thick wooden doors which, when they are opened, let outfierce blasts of air."
12235,6,These doors are an important part of theventilation system.
12236,6,"The exhausted air is sucked out of one shaft bymeans of fans, and the fresh air enters the other of its own accord."
12237,6,"Butif left to itself the air will take the shortest way round, leaving thedeeper workings unventilated; so all the short cuts have to bepartitioned off.At the start to walk stooping is rather a joke, but it is a joke thatsoon wears off."
12238,6,"I am handicapped by being exceptionally tall, but whenthe roof falls to four feet or less it is a tough job for anybody excepta dwarf or a child."
12239,6,"You not only have to bend double, you have also gotto keep your head up all the while so as to see the beams and girdersand dodge them when they come."
12240,6,"You have, therefore, a constant crick inthe neck, but this is nothing to the pain in your knees and thighs.After half a mile it becomes (I am not exaggerating) an unbearableagony."
12241,6,"You begin to wonder whether you will ever get to the end--stillmore, how on earth you are going to get back."
12242,6,Your pace grows slower andslower.
12243,6,You come to a stretch of a couple of hundred yards where it isall exceptionally low and you have to work yourself along in a squattingposition.
12244,6,"Then suddenly the roof opens out to a mysterious height--sceneof and old fall of rock, probably--and for twenty whole yards you canstand upright."
12245,6,The relief is overwhelming.
12246,6,But after this there isanother low stretch of a hundred yards and then a succession of beamswhich you have to crawl under.
12247,6,You go down on all fours; even this is arelief after the squatting business.
12248,6,"But when you come to the end of thebeams and try to get up again, you find that your knees have temporarilystruck work and refuse to lift you."
12249,6,"You call a halt, ignominiously, andsay that you would like to rest for a minute or two."
12250,6,Your guide (aminer) is sympathetic.
12251,6,He knows that your muscles are not the same ashis.
12252,6,"'Only another four hundred yards,' he says encouragingly; you feelthat he might as well say another four hundred miles."
12253,6,But finally you dosomehow creep as far as the coal face.
12254,6,You have gone a mile and takenthe best part of an hour; a miner would do it in not much more thantwenty minutes.
12255,6,"Having got there, you have to sprawl in the coal dustand get your strength back for several minutes before you can even watchthe work in progress with any kind of intelligence.Coming back is worse than going, not only because you are already tiredout but because the journey back to the shaft is slightly uphill."
12256,6,"Youget through the low places at the speed of a tortoise, and you have noshame now about calling a halt when your knees give way."
12257,6,"Even the lampyou are carrying becomes a nuisance and probably when you stumble youdrop it; whereupon, if it is a Davy lamp, it goes out."
12258,6,"Ducking the beamsbecomes more and more of an effort, and sometimes you forget to duck.You try walking head down as the miners do, and then you bang yourbackbone."
12259,6,Even the miners bang their backbones fairly often.
12260,6,"This is thereason why in very hot mines, where it is necessary to go about halfnaked, most of the miners have what they call 'buttons down theback'--that is, a permanent scab on each vertebra."
12261,6,"When the track isdown hill the miners sometimes fit their clogs, which are hollowunderneath, on to the trolley rails and slide down."
12262,6,"In mines where the'travelling' is very bad all the miners carry sticks about two and ahalf feet long, hollowed out below the handle."
12263,6,In normal places you keepyour hand on top of the stick and in the low places you slide your handdown into the hollow.
12264,6,"These sticks are a great help, and the woodencrash-helmets--a comparatively recent invention--are a godsend."
12265,6,"Theylook like a French or Italian steel helmet, but they are made of somekind of pith and very light, and so strong, that you can take a violentblow on the head without feeling it."
12266,6,"When finally you get back to thesurface you have been perhaps three hours underground and travelled twomiles, and you are more exhausted than you would be by atwenty-five-mile walk above ground."
12267,6,"For a week afterwards your thighsare so stiff that coming downstairs is quite a difficult feat; you haveto work your way down in a peculiar sidelong manner, without bending theknees."
12268,6,Your miner friends notice the stiffness of your walk and chaffyou about it.
12269,6,"('How'd ta like to work down pit, eh?' etc.) Yet even aminer who has been long away from work--from illness, forinstance--when he comes back to the pit, suffers badly for the first fewdays.It may seem that I am exaggerating, though no one who has been down anold-fashioned pit (most of the pits in England are old-fashioned) andactually gone as far as the coal face, is likely to say so."
12270,6,But what Iwant to emphasize is this.
12271,6,"Here is this frightful business of crawlingto and fro, which to any normal person is a hard day's work in itself;and it is not part of the miner's work at all, it is merely an extra,like the City man's daily ride in the Tube."
12272,6,"The miner does that journeyto and fro, and sandwiched in between there are seven and a half hoursof savage work."
12273,6,"I have never travelled much more than a mile to the coalface; but often it is three miles, in which case I and most people otherthan coal-miners would never get there at all."
12274,6,This is the kind of pointthat one is always liable to miss.
12275,6,"When you think of the coal-mine youthink of depth, heat, darkness, blackened figures hacking at walls ofcoal; you don't think, necessarily, of those miles of creeping to andfro."
12276,6,"There is the question of time, also."
12277,6,"A miner's working shift ofseven and a half hours does not sound very long, but one has got to addon to it at least an hour a day for 'travelling', more often two hoursand sometimes three."
12278,6,"Of course, the 'travelling' is not technically workand the miner is not paid for it; but it is as like work as makes nodifference."
12279,6,"It is easy to say that miners don't mind all this.Certainly, it is not the same for them as it would be for you or me.They have done it since childhood, they have the right muscles hardened,and they can move to and fro underground with a startling and ratherhorrible agility."
12280,6,"A miner puts his head down and runs, with a longswinging stride, through places where I can only stagger."
12281,6,"At theworkings you see them on all fours, skipping round the pit props almostlike dogs."
12282,6,But it is quite a mistake to think that they enjoy it.
12283,6,I havetalked about this to scores of miners and they all admit that the'travelling' is hard work; in any case when you hear them discussing apit among themselves the 'travelling' is always one of the things theydiscuss.
12284,6,"It is said that a shift always returns from work faster than itgoes; nevertheless the miners all say that it is the coming away after ahard day's work, that is especially irksome."
12285,6,"It is part of their workand they are equal to it, but certainly it is an effort."
12286,6,"It iscomparable, perhaps, to climbing a smallish mountain before and afteryour day's work.When you have been down in two or three pits you begin to get some graspof the processes that are going on underground."
12287,6,"(I ought to say, by theway, that I know nothing whatever about the technical side of mining: Iam merely describing what I have seen.) Coal lies in thin seams betweenenormous layers of rock, so that essentially the process of getting itout is like scooping the central layer from a Neapolitan ice."
12288,6,"In the olddays the miners used to cut straight into the coal with pick andcrowbar--a very slow job because coal, when lying in its virgin state,is almost as hard as rock."
12289,6,"Nowadays the preliminary work is done by anelectrically-driven coal-cutter, which in principle is an immenselytough and powerful band-saw, running horizontally instead of vertically,with teeth a couple of inches long and half an inch or an inch thick."
12290,6,"Itcan move backwards or forwards on its own power, and the men operatingit can rotate it this way or that."
12291,6,"Incidentally it makes one of the mostawful noises I have ever heard, and sends forth clouds of coal dustwhich make it impossible to see more than two to three feet and almostimpossible to breathe."
12292,6,The machine travels along the coal face cuttinginto the base of the coal and undermining it to the depth of five feetor five feet and a half; after this it is comparatively easy to extractthe coal to the depth to which it has been undermined.
12293,6,"Where it is'difficult getting', however, it has also to be loosened withexplosives."
12294,6,"A man with an electric drill, like a rather small version ofthe drills used in street-mending, bores holes at intervals in the coal,inserts blasting powder, plugs it with clay, goes round the corner ifthere is one handy (he is supposed to retire to twenty-five yardsdistance) and touches off the charge with an electric current."
12295,6,"This isnot intended to bring the coal out, only to loosen it."
12296,6,"Occasionally, ofcourse, the charge is too powerful, and then it not only brings the coalout but brings the roof down as well.After the blasting has been done the 'fillers' can tumble the coal out,break it up and shovel it on to the conveyor belt."
12297,6,It comes out first inmonstrous boulders which may weigh anything up to twenty tons.
12298,6,"Theconveyor belt shoots it on to tubs, and the tubs are shoved into themain road and hitched on to an endlessly revolving steel cable whichdrags them to the cage."
12299,6,"Then they are hoisted, and at the surface thecoal is sorted by being run over screens, and if necessary is washed aswell."
12300,6,"As far as possible the 'dirt'--the shale, that is--is used formaking the roads below."
12301,6,"All what cannot be used is sent to the surfaceand dumped; hence the monstrous 'dirt-heaps', like hideous greymountains, which are the characteristic scenery of the coal areas."
12302,6,"Whenthe coal has been extracted to the depth to which the machine has cut,the coal face has advanced by five feet."
12303,6,"Fresh props are put in to holdup the newly exposed roof, and during the next shift the conveyor beltis taken to pieces, moved five feet forward and re-assembled."
12304,6,"As far aspossible the three operations of cutting, blasting and extraction aredone in three separate shifts, the cutting in the afternoon, theblasting at night (there is a law, not always kept, that forbids itsbeing done when other men are working near by), and the 'filling' in themorning shift, which lasts from six in the morning until half past one.Even when you watch the process of coal-extraction you probably onlywatch it for a short time, and it is not until you begin making a fewcalculations that you realize what a stupendous task the 'fillers' areperforming."
12305,6,Normally each man has to clear a space four or five yardswide.
12306,6,"The cutter has undermined the coal to the depth of five feet, sothat if the seam of coal is three or four feet high, each man has to cutout, break up and load on to the belt something between seven and twelvecubic yards of coal."
12307,6,"This is to say, taking a cubic yard as weighingtwenty-seven hundred-weight, that each man is shifting coal at a speedapproaching two tons an hour."
12308,6,I have just enough experience of pick andshovel work to be able to grasp what this means.
12309,6,"When I am diggingtrenches in my garden, if I shift two tons of earth during theafternoon, I feel that I have earned my tea."
12310,6,"But earth is tractablestuff compared with coal, and I don't have to work kneeling down, athousand feet underground, in suffocating heat and swallowing coal dustwith every breath I take; nor do I have to walk a mile bent doublebefore I begin."
12311,6,The miner's job would be as much beyond my power as itwould be to perform on a flying trapeze or to win the Grand National.
12312,6,"Iam not a manual labourer and please God I never shall be one, but thereare some kinds of manual work that I could do if I had to."
12313,6,At a pitch Icould be a tolerable road-sweeper or an inefficient gardener or even atenth-rate farm hand.
12314,6,"But by no conceivable amount of effort or trainingcould I become a coal-miner, the work would kill me in a few weeks.Watching coal-miners at work, you realize momentarily what differentuniverses people inhabit."
12315,6,Down there where coal is dug is a sort ofworld apart which one can quite easily go through life without everhearing about.
12316,6,Probably majority of people would even prefer not to hearabout it.
12317,6,Yet it is the absolutely necessary counterpart of our worldabove.
12318,6,"Practically everything we do, from eating an ice to crossing theAtlantic, and from baking a loaf to writing a novel, involves the use ofcoal, directly or indirectly."
12319,6,For all the arts of peace coal is needed;if war breaks out it is needed all the more.
12320,6,"In time of revolution theminer must go on working or the revolution must stop, for revolution asmuch as reaction needs coal."
12321,6,"Whatever may be happening on the surface,the hacking and shovelling have got to continue without a pause, or atany rate without pausing for more than a few weeks at the most."
12322,6,"In orderthat Hitler may march the goose-step, that the Pope may denounceBolshevism, that the cricket crowds may assemble at Lords, that thepoets may scratch one another's backs, coal has got to be forthcoming.But on the whole we are not aware of it; we all know that we 'must havecoal', but we seldom or never remember what coal-getting involves."
12323,6,Heream I sitting writing in front of my comfortable coal fire.
12324,6,It is Aprilbut I still need a fire.
12325,6,Once a fortnight the coal cart drives up to thedoor and men in leather jerkins carry the coal indoors in stout sackssmelling of tar and shoot it clanking into the coal-hole under thestairs.
12326,6,"It is only very rarely, when I make a definite mental-effort,that I connect this coal with that far-off labour in the mines."
12327,6,"It isjust 'coal'--something that I have got to have; black stuff that arrivesmysteriously from nowhere in particular, like manna except that you haveto pay for it."
12328,6,You could quite easily drive a car right across the northof England and never once remember that hundreds of feet below the roadyou are on the miners are hacking at the coal.
12329,6,Yet in a sense it is theminers who are driving your car forward.
12330,6,Their lamp-lit world down thereis as necessary to the daylight world above as the root is to theflower.It is not long since conditions in the mines were worse than they arenow.
12331,6,"There are still living a few very old women who in their youth haveworked underground, with the harness round their waists, and a chainthat passed between their legs, crawling on all fours and dragging tubsof coal."
12332,6,They used to go on doing this even when they were pregnant.
12333,6,"Andeven now, if coal could not be produced without pregnant women draggingit to and fro, I fancy we should let them do it rather than depriveourselves of coal."
12334,6,"But-most of the time, of course, we should prefer toforget that they were doing it."
12335,6,"It is so with all types of manual work;it keeps us alive, and we are oblivious of its existence."
12336,6,"More thananyone else, perhaps, the miner can stand as the type of the manualworker, not only because his work is so exaggeratedly awful, but alsobecause it is so vitally necessary and yet so remote from ourexperience, so invisible, as it were, that we are capable of forgettingit as we forget the blood in our veins."
12337,6,In a way it is even humiliatingto watch coal-miners working.
12338,6,"It raises in you a momentary doubt aboutyour own status as an 'intellectual' and a superior person generally.For it is brought home to you, at least while you are watching, that itis only because miners sweat their guts out that superior persons canremain superior."
12339,6,"You and I and the editor of the _Times Lit._ _Supp._,and the nancy poets and the Archbishop of Canterbury and Comrade X,author of _Marxism for Infants_--all of us _really_ owe the comparativedecency of our lives to poor drudges underground, blackened to the eyes,with their throats full of coal dust, driving their shovels forward witharms and belly muscles of steel.3When the miner comes up from the pit his face is so pale that it isnoticeable even through the mask of coal dust."
12340,6,"This is due to the foulair that he has been breathing, and will wear off presently."
12341,6,"To aSoutherner, new to the mining districts, the spectacle of a shift ofseveral hundred miners streaming out of the pit is strange and slightlysinister."
12342,6,"Then-exhausted faces, with the grime clinging in all thehollows, have a fierce, wild look."
12343,6,"At other times, when their faces areclean, there is not much to distinguish them from the rest of thepopulation."
12344,6,"They have a very upright square-shouldered walk, a reactionfrom the constant bending underground, but most of them are shortish menand their thick ill-fitting clothes hide the splendour of their bodies.The most definitely distinctive thing about them is the blue scars ontheir noses."
12345,6,"Every miner has blue scars on his nose and forehead, andwill carry them to his death."
12346,6,"The coal dust of which the air undergroundis full enters every cut, and then the skin grows over it and forms ablue stain like tattooing, which in fact it is."
12347,6,"Some of the older menhave their foreheads veined like Roquefort cheeses from this cause.As soon as the miner comes above ground he gargles a little water to getthe worst of the coal dust out of his throat and nostrils, and then goeshome and either washes or does not wash according to his temperament.From what I have seen I should say that a majority of miners prefer toeat their meal first and wash afterwards, as I should do in theircircumstances."
12348,6,"It is the normal thing to see a miner sitting down to histea with a Christy-minstrel face, completely black except for very redlips which become clean by eating."
12349,6,"After his meal he takes a largishbasin of water and washes very methodically, first his hands, then hischest, neck, and armpits, then his forearms, then his face and scalp (itis on the scalp that the grime clings thickest), and then his wife takesthe flannel and washes his back."
12350,6,"He has only washed the top half of hisbody and probably his navel is still a nest of coal dust, but even so ittakes some skill to get pass-ably clean in a single basin of water."
12351,6,Formy own part I found I needed two complete baths after going down acoal-mine.
12352,6,Getting the dirt out of one's eyelids is a ten minutes' jobin itself.At some of the larger and better appointed collieries there are pitheadbaths.
12353,6,"This is an enormous advantage, for not only can the miner washhimself all over every day, in comfort and even luxury, but at the bathshe has two lockers where he can keep his pit clothes separate from hisday clothes, so that within twenty minutes of emerging as black as aNegro he can be riding off to a football match dressed up to the nines.But it is only comparatively seldom because a seam of coal does not lastfor ever, so that it is not necessarily worth building a bath every timea shaft is sunk."
12354,6,"I can-not get hold of exact figures, but it seemslikely that rather less than one miner in three has access to a pitheadbath."
12355,6,Probably a large majority of miners are completely black from thewaist down for at least six days a week.
12356,6,It is almost impossible forthem to wash all over in their own homes.
12357,6,"Every drop of water has got tobe heated up, and in a tiny living-room which contains, apart from thekitchen range and a quantity of furniture, a wife, some children, andprobably a dog, there is simply not room to have a proper bath."
12358,6,Evenwith a basin one is bound to splash the furniture.
12359,6,"Middle-class peopleare fond of saying that the miners would not wash themselves properlyeven if they could, but this is nonsense, as is shown by the fact thatwhere pithead baths exist practically all the men use them."
12360,6,Only amongthe very old men does the belief still linger that washing one's legs'causes lumbago'.
12361,6,"Moreover the pithead baths, where they exist, are paidfor wholly or partly by the miners themselves, out of the Miners'Welfare Fund."
12362,6,"Sometimes the colliery company subscribes, some-times theFund bears the whole cost."
12363,6,"But doubtless even at this late date the oldladies in Brighton boarding-houses are saying that 'if you give thoseminers baths they only use them to keep coal in'.As a matter of fact it is surprising that miners wash as regularly asthey do, seeing how little time they have between work and sleep."
12364,6,It isa great mistake to think of a miner's working day as being only sevenand a half hours.
12365,6,"Seven and a half hours is the time spent actually onthe job, but, as I have already explained, one has got to add on to thistime taken up in 'travelling', which is seldom less than an hour and mayoften be three hours."
12366,6,In addition most miners have to spend aconsiderable time in getting to and from the pit.
12367,6,"Throughout theindustrial districts there is an acute shortage of houses, and it isonly in the small mining villages, where the village is grouped roundthe pit, that the men can be certain of living near their work."
12368,6,"In thelarger mining towns where I have stayed, nearly everyone went to work bybus; half a crown a week seemed to be the normal amount to spend onfares."
12369,6,"One miner I stayed with was working on the morning shift, whichwas from six in the morning till half past one."
12370,6,He had to be out of bedat a quarter to four and got back somewhere after three in theafternoon.
12371,6,In another house where I stayed a boy of fifteen was workingon the night shift.
12372,6,"He left for work at nine at night and got back ateight in the morning, had his breakfast, and then promptly went to bedand slept till six in the evening; so that his leisure time amounted to,about four hours a day--actually a good deal less, if you take off thetime for washing, eating, and dressing.The adjustments a miner's family have to make when he is changed fromone shift to another must be tiresome in the extreme."
12373,6,"If he is on thenight shift he gets home in time for breakfast, on the morning shift hegets home in the middle of the afternoon, and on the afternoon shift hegets home in the middle of the night; and in each case, of course, hewants his principal meal of the day as soon as he returns."
12374,6,I notice thatthe Rev.
12375,6,W.
12376,6,R.
12377,6,"Inge, in his book _England_, accuses the miners ofgluttony."
12378,6,From my own observation I should say that they eatastonishingly little.
12379,6,Most of the miners I stayed with ate slightly lessthan I did.
12380,6,"Many of them declare that they cannot do their day's work ifthey have had a heavy meal beforehand, and the food they take with themis only a snack, usually bread-and-dripping and cold tea."
12381,6,They carry itin a flat tin called a snap-can which they strap to their belts.
12382,6,"When aminer gets back late at night his wife waits up for him, but when he ison the morning shift it seems to be the custom for him to get hisbreakfast for himself."
12383,6,Apparently the old superstition that it is badluck to see a woman before going to work on the morning shift is notquite extinct.
12384,6,"In the old days, it is said, a miner who happened to meeta woman in the early morning would often turn back and do no work thatday.Before I had been in the coal areas I shared the wide-spread illusionthat miners are comparatively well paid."
12385,6,"One hears it loosely statedthat a miner is paid ten or eleven shillings a shift, and one does asmall multiplication sum and concludes that every miner is earning roundabout 2 a week or 150 a year."
12386,6,But the statement that a miner receivesten or eleven shillings a shift is very misleading.
12387,6,"To begin with, it isonly the actual coal 'getter' who is paid at this rate; a 'dataller',for instance, who attends to the roofing, is paid at a lower rate,usually eight or nine shillings a shift."
12388,6,"Again, when the coal 'getter'is paid piecework, so much per ton extracted, as is the case in manymines, he is dependent on the quality of the coal; a breakdown in themachinery or a 'fault'--that is, a streak of rock running through thecoal seam--may rob him of his earnings for a day or two at a time."
12389,6,"Butin any case one ought not to think of the miner as working six days aweek, fifty-two weeks a year."
12390,6,Almost certainly there will be a number ofdays when he is' laid off'.
12391,6,"The average earning per shift worked forevery mine-worker, of all ages and both sexes, in Great Britain in 1934,was 9s."
12392,6,1 3/4d.
12393,6,"[From the _Colliery Year Book_ and Coal TradesDirectory_ for 1935.] If everyone were in work all the time, this wouldmean that the mine-worker was earning a little over 142 a year, ornearly 2 15s."
12394,6,a week.
12395,6,"His real income, however, is far lower than this,for the 9s."
12396,6,1 3/4d.
12397,6,"is merely an average calculation on shifts actuallyworked and takes no account of blank days.I have before me five pay-checks belonging to a Yorkshire miner, forfive weeks (not consecutive) at the beginning of 1936."
12398,6,"Averaging themup, the gross weekly wages they represent is 2 15s."
12399,6,2d.; this is anaverage of nearly 9s.
12400,6,2 1/2d.
12401,6,a shift.
12402,6,"But these pay-checks are for thewinter, when nearly all mines are running full time."
12403,6,"As spring advancesthe coal trade slacks off and more and more men are 'temporarilystopped', while others still technically in work are laid off for a dayor two in every week."
12404,6,It is obvious therefore that 150 or even 142 isan immense over-estimate for the mine-worker's yearly income.
12405,6,"As amatter of fact, for the year 1934 the average gross earnings of allminers through-out Great Britain was only 115 11s."
12406,6,6d.
12407,6,"It variedconsider-ably from district to district, rising as high as 133 2s."
12408,6,"8d.in Scotland, while in Durham it was a little under 105 or barely morethan 2 a week."
12409,6,"I take these figures from The Coal Scuttle, by Mr JosephJones, Mayor of Barnsley, Yorkshire."
12410,6,"Mr Jones adds:These figures cover the earnings of youths as well as adults and of thehigher- as well as the lower-paid grades...any particularly highearning would be included in these figures, as would the earnings ofcertain officials and other higher-paid men as well as the higheramounts paid for overtime work._The figures, being averages, fail...to reveal the position of thousandsof adult workers whose earnings were substantially below the averageand' who received only 30s."
12411,6,to 40s.
12412,6,or less per week._Mr Jones's italics.
12413,6,But please notice that even these wretched earningsare _gross_ earnings.
12414,6,On top of this there are all kinds of stoppageswhich are deducted from the miner's wages every week.
12415,6,Here is a list ofweekly stoppages which was given me as typical in one Lancashiredistrict:                                        s.
12416,6,"d.Insurance (unemployment and health)     1  5Hire of lamp                               6For sharpening tools                       6Check-weighman                             9Infirmary                                  2Hospital                                   1Benevolent Fund                            6Union fees                                 6                                        ----Total                                    4 5                                        ----Some of these stoppages, such as the Benevolent Fund and the union fees,are, so to speak, the miner's own responsibility, others are imposed bythe colliery company."
12417,6,They are not the same in all districts.
12418,6,"Forinstance, the iniquitous swindle of making the miner pay for the hire ofhis lamp (at sixpence a week he buys the lamp several times over in asingle year) does not obtain everywhere."
12419,6,But the stoppages always seemto total up to about the same amount.
12420,6,"On the Yorkshire miner's fivepay-checks, the average gross earning per week is 2 15s."
12421,6,"2d.; theaverage net earning, after the stoppages have come off, is only 2 11s.4d.--a reduction of 3s."
12422,6,10d.
12423,6,a week.
12424,6,"But the pay-check, naturally, onlymentions stoppages which are imposed or paid through the collierycompany; one has got to add the union fees, bringing the total reductionup to something over four shillings."
12425,6,Probably it is safe to say thatstoppages of one kind and another cut four shillings or thereabouts from_every_ adult miner's weekly wage.
12426,6,So that the 115 11s.
12427,6,6d.
12428,6,which wasthe mine-worker's average earning throughout Great Britain in 1934should really be something nearer 105.
12429,6,"As against this, most minersreceive allowances in kind, being able to purchase coal for their ownuse at a reduced rate, usually eight or nine shillings a ton."
12430,6,"Butaccording to Mr Jones, quoted above, 'the average value of allallowances in kind for the country as a whole is only fourpence a day'.And this fourpence a day is offset, in many cases, by the amount theminer has to spend on fares in getting to and from the pit."
12431,6,"So, takingthe industry as a whole, the sum the miner can actually bring home andcall his own does not average more, perhaps slightly less, than twopounds a week.Meanwhile, how much coal is the average miner producing?The tonnage of coal raised yearly per person employed in mining risessteadily though rather slowly."
12432,6,"In 1914 every mine-worker produced, onaverage, 253 tons of coal; in 1934 he produced 280 tons.[_The CoalScuttle_."
12433,6,"The _Colliery Year Book end Coal Trades Directory_ gives aslightly higher figure.] This of course is an average figure formine-workers of all kinds; those actually working at the coal faceextract an enormously greater amount--in many cases, probably, well overa thousand tons each."
12434,6,"But taking 280 tons as a representative figure, itis worth noticing what a vast achievement this is."
12435,6,One gets the bestidea of it by comparing a miner's life with somebody else's.
12436,6,"If I liveto be sixty I shall probably have produced thirty novels, or enough tofill two medium-sized library shelves."
12437,6,"In the same period the averageminer produces 8400 tons of coal; enough coal to pave Trafalgar Squarenearly two feet deep or to supply seven large families with fuel forover a hundred years.Of the five pay-checks I mentioned above, no less than three arerubber-stamped with the words 'death stoppage'."
12438,6,"When a miner is killedat work it is usual for the other miners to make up a subscription,generally of a shilling each, for his widow, and this is collected bythe colliery company and automatically deducted from their wages."
12439,6,Thesignificant detail here is the rubber stamp.
12440,6,"The rate of accidents amongminers is so high, compared with that in other trades, that casualtiesare taken for granted almost as they would be in a minor war."
12441,6,"Every yearone miner in about nine hundred is killed and one in about six isinjured; most of these injuries, of course, are petty ones, but a fairnumber amount to total disablement."
12442,6,This means that if a miner's workinglife is forty years the chances are nearly seven to one against hisescaping injury and not much more than twenty to one against his beingkilled outright.
12443,6,"No other trade approaches this in dangerousness; thenext most dangerous is the shipping trade, one sailor in a little under1300 being killed every year."
12444,6,"The figures I have given apply, of course,to mine-workers as a whole; for those actually working underground theproportion of injuries would be very much higher."
12445,6,"Every miner of longstanding that I have talked to had either been in a fairly seriousaccident himself or had seen some of his mates killed, and in everymining family they tell you tales of fathers, brothers, or uncles killedat work."
12446,6,"('And he fell seven hundred feet, and they wouldn't never havecollected t'pieces only he were wearing a new suit of oil-skins,' etc.,etc., etc.) Some of these tales are appalling in the extreme."
12447,6,"One miner,for instance, described to me how a mate of his, a 'dataller', wasburied by a fall of rock."
12448,6,"They rushed to him and managed to uncover hishead and shoulders so that he could breathe, and he was alive and spoketo them."
12449,6,Then they saw that the roof was coming down again and had torun to save themselves; the 'dataller' was buried a second time.
12450,6,"Onceagain they rushed to him and got his head and shoulders free, and againhe was alive and spoke to them."
12451,6,"Then the roof came down a third time,and this time they could not uncover him for several hours, after which,of course, he was dead."
12452,6,"But the miner who told me the story (he had beenburied himself on one occasion, but he was lucky enough to have his headjammed between his legs so that there was a small space in which hecould breathe) did not think it was a particularly appalling one."
12453,6,"Itssignificance, for him, was that the 'dataller' had known perfectly wellthat the place where he was working was unsafe, and had gone there indaily expectation of an accident."
12454,6,'And it worked on his mind to thatextent that he got to kissing his wife before he went to work.
12455,6,"And shetold me afterwards that it were over twenty years since he'd kissedher.'The most obviously understandable cause of accidents is explosions ofgas, which is always more or less present in the atmosphere of the pit.There is a special lamp which is used to test the air for gas, and whenit is present in at all large quantities it can be detected by the flameof an ordinary Davy lamp burning blue."
12456,6,"If the wick can be turned up toits full extent and the flame is still blue, the proportion of gas isdangerously high; it is, nevertheless, difficult to detect, because itdoes not distribute itself evenly throughout the atmosphere but hangsabout in cracks and crevices."
12457,6,Before starting work a miner often testsfor gas by poking his lamp into all the corners.
12458,6,"The gas may be touchedoff by a spark during blasting operations, or by a pick striking a sparkfrom a stone, or by a defective lamp, or by 'gob fires'--spontaneouslygenerated fires which' smoulder in the coal dust and are very hard toput out."
12459,6,"The great mining disasters which happen from time to time, inwhich several hundred men are killed, are usually caused by explosions;hence one tends to think of explosions as the chief danger of mining.Actually, the great majority of accidents are due to the normalevery-day dangers of the pit; in particular, to falls of roof."
12460,6,"Thereare, for instance, 'pot-holes'--circular holes from which a lump ofstone big enough to kill a man shoots out with the promptitude of abullet."
12461,6,"With, so far as I can remember, only one exception, all theminers I have talked to declared that the new machinery, and 'speedingup' generally, have made the work more dangerous."
12462,6,"This may be partly dueto conservatism, but they can give plenty of reasons."
12463,6,"To begin with, thespeed at which the coal is now extracted means that for hours at a timea dangerously large stretch of roof remains unpropped."
12464,6,"Then there is thevibration, which tends to shake everything loose, and the noise, whichmakes it harder to detect signs of danger."
12465,6,One must remember that aminer's safety underground depend largely on his own care and skill.
12466,6,Anexperienced miner claims to know by a sort of instinct when the roof isunsafe; the way he puts it is that he 'can feel the weight on him'.
12467,6,"Hecan, for instance, hear the faint creaking of the props."
12468,6,"The reason whywooden props are still generally preferred to iron girders is that awooden prop which is about to collapse gives warning by creaking,whereas a girder flies out un-expectedly."
12469,6,"The devastating noise of themachines makes it impossible to hear anything else, and thus the dangeris increased.When a miner is hurt it is of course impossible to attend to himimmediately."
12470,6,"He lies crushed under several hundred-weight of stone insome dreadful cranny underground, and even after he has been extricatedit is necessary to drag his body a mile or more, perhaps, throughgalleries where nobody can stand upright."
12471,6,Usually when you talk to a manwho has been injured you find that it was a couple of hours or so beforethey got him to the surface.
12472,6,"Sometimes, of course, there are accidentsto the cage."
12473,6,"The cage is shooting several yards up or down at the speedof an express train, and it is operated by somebody on the surface whocannot see what is happening."
12474,6,"He has very delicate indicators to tellhim how far the cage has got, but it is possible for him to make amistake, and there have been cases of the cage crashing into thepit-bottom at its very maximum speed."
12475,6,This seems to me a dreadful way todie.
12476,6,For as that tiny steel box whizzes through the blackness there mustcome a moment when the ten men who are locked inside it _know_ thatsomething has gone wrong; and the remaining seconds before they aresmashed to pieces hardly bear thinking about.
12477,6,A miner told me he wasonce in a cage in which something went wrong.
12478,6,"It did not slow up when itshould have done, and they thought the cable must have snapped."
12479,6,"As ithappened they got to the bottom safely, but when he stepped out he foundthat he had broken a tooth; he had been clenching his teeth so hard inexpectation of that frightful crash.Apart from accidents miners seem to be healthy, as obviously they havegot to be, considering the muscular efforts demanded of them."
12480,6,"They areliable to rheumatism and a man with defective lungs does not last longin that dust-impregnated air, but the most characteristic industrialdisease is nystagmus."
12481,6,This is a disease of the eyes which makes theeyeballs oscillate in a strange manner when they come near a light.
12482,6,"Itis due presumably to working in half-darkness, and sometimes results intotal blindness."
12483,6,"Miners who are disabled in this way or any other wayare compensated by the colliery company, sometimes with a lump sum,sometimes with a weekly pension."
12484,6,This pension never amounts to more thantwenty-nine shillings a week; if it falls below fifteen shillings thedisabled man can also get something from the dole or the P.A.C.
12485,6,"If Iwere a disabled miner I should very much prefer the lump sum, for thenat any rate I should know that I had got my money."
12486,6,"Disability pensionsare not guaranteed by any centralized fund, so that if the collierycompany goes bankrup."
12487,6,"In the Lenin Barracks in Barcelona, the day before I joined the militia,I saw an Italian militiaman standing in front of the officers' table.He was a tough-looking youth of twenty-five or six, with reddish-yellowhair and powerful shoulders."
12488,6,His peaked leather cap was pulled fiercelyover one eye.
12489,6,"He was standing in profile to me, his chin on his breast,gazing with a puzzled frown at a map which one of the officers had openon the table."
12490,6,Something in his face deeply moved me.
12491,6,"It was the face ofa man who would commit murder and throw away his life for a friend--thekind of face you would expect in an Anarchist, though as likely as nothe was a Communist."
12492,6,There were both candour and ferocity in it; also thepathetic reverence that illiterate people have for their supposedsuperiors.
12493,6,Obviously he could not make head or tail of the map;obviously he regarded map-reading as a stupendous intellectual feat.
12494,6,"Ihardly know why, but I have seldom seen anyone--any man, I mean--to whomI have taken such an immediate liking."
12495,6,While they were talking round thetable some remark brought it out that I was a foreigner.
12496,6,"The Italianraised his head and said quickly:'_Italiano?_'I answered in my bad Spanish: '_No, Ingl鳮 Y t?_''_Italiano_.'As we went out he stepped across the room and gripped my hand very hard.Queer, the affection you can feel for a stranger! It was as though hisspirit and mine had momentarily succeeded in bridging the gulf oflanguage and tradition and meeting in utter intimacy."
12497,6,I hoped he likedme as well as I liked him.
12498,6,But I also knew that to retain my firstimpression of him I must not see him again; and needless to say I neverdid see him again.
12499,6,One was always making contacts of that kind in Spain.I mention this Italian militiaman because he has stuck vividly in mymemory.
12500,6,With his shabby uniform and fierce pathetic face he typifies forme the special atmosphere of that time.
12501,6,"He is bound up with all mymemories of that period of the war--the red flags in Barcelona, thegaunt trains full of shabby soldiers creeping to the front, the greywar-stricken towns farther up the line, the muddy, ice-cold trenches inthe mountains.This was in late December 1936, less than seven months ago as I write,and yet it is a period that has already receded into enormous distance.Later events have obliterated it much more completely than they haveobliterated 1935, or 1905, for that matter."
12502,6,"I had come to Spain withsome notion of writing newspaper articles, but I had joined the militiaalmost immediately, because at that time and in that atmosphere itseemed the only conceivable thing to do."
12503,6,The Anarchists were still invirtual control of Catalonia and the revolution was still in full swing.To anyone who had been there since the beginning it probably seemed evenin December or January that the revolutionary period was ending; butwhen one came straight from England the aspect of Barcelona wassomething startling and overwhelming.
12504,6,It was the first time that I hadever been in a town where the working class was in the saddle.Practically every building of any size had been seized by the workersand was draped with red flags or with the red and black flag of theAnarchists; every wall was scrawled with the hammer and sickle and withthe initials of the revolutionary parties; almost every church had beengutted and its images burnt.
12505,6,Churches here and there were beingsystematically demolished by gangs of workmen.
12506,6,Every shop and caf頨adan inscription saying that it had been collectivized; even thebootblacks had been collectivized and their boxes painted red and black.Waiters and shop-walkers looked you in the face and treated you as anequal.
12507,6,Servile and even ceremonial forms of speech had temporarilydisappeared.
12508,6,"Nobody said '_Se񯲟' or '_Don_' or even '_Usted_'; everyonecalled everyone else '_Comrade_' and '_Thou_', and said '_Salud!_' insteadof '_Buenos d__'."
12509,6,Tipping was forbidden by law since the time of Primode Rivera; almost my first experience was receiving a lecture from a hotelmanager for trying to tip a lift-boy.
12510,6,"There were no private motor-cars,they had all been commandeered, and all the trams and taxis and much ofthe other transport were painted red and black."
12511,6,"The revolutionaryposters were everywhere, flaming from the walls in clean reds and bluesthat made the few remaining advertisements look like daubs of mud."
12512,6,"Downthe Ramblas, the wide central artery of the town where crowds of peoplestreamed constantly to and fro, the loudspeakers were bellowingrevolutionary songs all day and far into the night."
12513,6,And it was theaspect of the crowds that was the queerest thing of all.
12514,6,In outwardappearance it was a town in which the wealthy classes had practicallyceased to exist.
12515,6,Except for a small number of women and foreigners therewere no 'well-dressed' people at all.
12516,6,"Practically everyone wore roughworking-class clothes, or blue overalls, or some variant of the militiauniform."
12517,6,All this was queer and moving.
12518,6,"There was much in it that I didnot understand, in some ways I did not even like it, but I recognized itimmediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for."
12519,6,"Also I believedthat things were as they appeared, that this was really a workers' Stateand that the entire bourgeoisie had either fled, been killed, orvoluntarily come over to the workers' side; I did not realize that greatnumbers of well-to-do bourgeois were simply lying low and disguisingthemselves as proletarians for the time being.Together with all this there was something of the evil atmosphere ofwar."
12520,6,"The town had a gaunt untidy look, roads and buildings were in poorrepair, the streets at night were dimly lit for fear of air-raids, theshops were mostly shabby and half-empty."
12521,6,"Meat was scarce and milkpractically unobtainable, there was a shortage of coal, sugar, andpetrol, and a really serious shortage of bread."
12522,6,Even at this period thebread-queues were often hundreds of yards long.
12523,6,Yet so far as one couldjudge the people were contented and hopeful.
12524,6,"There was no unemployment,and the price of living was still extremely low; you saw very fewconspicuously destitute people, and no beggars except the gipsies."
12525,6,"Aboveall, there was a belief in the revolution and the future, a feeling ofhaving suddenly emerged into an era of equality and freedom."
12526,6,Humanbeings were trying to behave as human beings and not as cogs in thecapitalist machine.
12527,6,In the barbers' shops were Anarchist notices (thebarbers were mostly Anarchists) solemnly explaining that barbers were nolonger slaves.
12528,6,In the streets were coloured posters appealing toprostitutes to stop being prostitutes.
12529,6,"To anyone from the hard-boiled,sneering civilization of the English-speaking races there was somethingrather pathetic in the literalness with which these idealistic Spaniardstook the hackneyed phrases of revolution."
12530,6,"At that time revolutionaryballads of the naivest kind, all about proletarian brotherhood and thewickedness of Mussolini, were being sold on the streets for a fewcentimes each."
12531,6,"I have often seen an illiterate militiaman buy one ofthese ballads, laboriously spell out the words, and then, when he hadgot the hang of it, begin singing it to an appropriate tune.All this time I was at the Lenin Barracks, ostensibly in training forthe front."
12532,6,"When I joined the militia I had been told that I should besent to the front the next day, but in fact I had to wait while a fresh_centuria_ was got ready."
12533,6,"The workers' militias, hurriedly raised by thetrade unions at the beginning of the war, had not yet been organized onan ordinary army basis."
12534,6,"The units of command were the 'section', ofabout thirty men, the _centuria_, of about a hundred men, and the'column', which in practice meant any large number of men."
12535,6,The LeninBarracks was a block of splendid stone buildings with a riding-schooland enormous cobbled courtyards; it had been a cavalry barracks and hadbeen captured during the July fighting.
12536,6,"My _centuria_ slept in one of thestables, under the stone mangers where the names of the cavalry chargerswere still inscribed."
12537,6,"All the horses had been seized and sent to thefront, but the whole place still smelt of horse-piss and rotten oats."
12538,6,Iwas at the barracks about a week.
12539,6,"Chiefly I remember the horsy smells,the quavering bugle-calls (all our buglers were amateurs--I firstlearned the Spanish bugle-calls by listening to them outside the Fascistlines), the tramp-tramp of hobnailed boots in the barrack yard, the longmorning parades in the wintry sunshine, the wild games of football,fifty a side, in the gravelled riding-school."
12540,6,"There were perhaps athousand men at the barracks, and a score or so of women, apart from themilitiamen's wives who did the cooking."
12541,6,"There were still women servingin the militias, though not very many."
12542,6,In the early battles they hadfought side by side with the men as a matter of course.
12543,6,It is a thingthat seems natural in time of revolution.
12544,6,"Ideas were changing already,however."
12545,6,The militiamen had to be kept out of the riding-school whilethe women were drilling there because they laughed at the women and putthem off.
12546,6,A few months earlier no one would have seen anything comic ina woman handling a gun.The whole barracks was in the state of filth and chaos to which themilitia reduced every building they occupied and which seems to be oneof the by-products of revolution.
12547,6,"In every corner you came upon piles ofsmashed furniture, broken saddles, brass cavalry-helmets, emptysabre-scabbards, and decaying food."
12548,6,"There was frightful wastage of food,especially bread."
12549,6,From my barrack-room alone a basketful of bread wasthrown away at every meal--a disgraceful thing when the civilianpopulation was short of it.
12550,6,"We ate at long trestle-tables out ofpermanently greasy tin pannikins, and drank out of a dreadful thingcalled a _porr󮟮 A _porr󮟠is a sort of glass bottle with a pointedspout from which a thin jet of wine spurts out whenever you tip it up;you can thus drink from a distance, without touching it with your lips,and it can be passed from hand to hand."
12551,6,I went on strike and demanded adrinking-cup as soon as I saw a _porr󮟠in use.
12552,6,"To my eye the thingswere altogether too like bed-bottles, especially when they were filledwith white wine.By degrees they were issuing the recruits with uniforms, and becausethis was Spain everything was issued piecemeal, so that it was neverquite certain who had received what, and various of the things we mostneeded, such as belts and cartridge-boxes, were not issued till the lastmoment, when the train was actually waiting to take us to the front."
12553,6,"Ihave spoken of the militia 'uniform', which probably gives a wrongimpression."
12554,6,It was not exactly a uniform.
12555,6,Perhaps a 'multiform' would bethe proper name for it.
12556,6,"Everyone's clothes followed the same generalplan, but they were never quite the same in any two cases."
12557,6,"Practicallyeveryone in the army wore corduroy knee-breeches, but there theuniformity ended."
12558,6,"Some wore puttees, others corduroy gaiters, othersleather leggings or high boots."
12559,6,"Everyone wore a zipper jacket, but someof the jackets were of leather, others of wool and of every conceivablecolour."
12560,6,The kinds of cap were about as numerous as their wearers.
12561,6,"It wasusual to adorn the front of your cap with a party badge, and in additionnearly every man wore a red or red and black handkerchief round histhroat."
12562,6,A militia column at that time was an extraordinary-lookingrabble.
12563,6,"But the clothes had to be issued as this or that factory rushedthem out, and they were not bad clothes considering the circumstances.The shirts and socks were wretched cotton things, however, quite uselessagainst cold."
12564,6,I hate to think of what the militiamen must have gonethrough in the earlier months before anything was organized.
12565,6,I remembercoming upon a newspaper of only about two months earlier in which one ofthe P.O.U.M.
12566,6,"leaders, after a visit to the front, said that he would tryto see to it that 'every militiaman had a blanket'."
12567,6,A phrase to make youshudder if you have ever slept in a trench.On my second day at the barracks there began what was comically called'instruction'.
12568,6,"At the beginning there were frightful scenes of chaos.The recruits were mostly boys of sixteen or seventeen from the backstreets of Barcelona, full of revolutionary ardour but completelyignorant of the meaning of war."
12569,6,It was impossible even to get them tostand in line.
12570,6,Discipline did not exist; if a man disliked an order hewould step out of the ranks and argue fiercely with the officer.
12571,6,"Thelieutenant who instructed us was a stout, fresh-faced, pleasant youngman who had previously been a Regular Army officer, and still lookedlike one, with his smart carriage and spick-and-span uniform."
12572,6,Curiouslyenough he was a sincere and ardent Socialist.
12573,6,Even more than the menthemselves he insisted upon complete social equality between all ranks.I remember his pained surprise when an ignorant recruit addressed him as'_Se񯲟'.
12574,6,'What! _Se񯲟? Who is that calling me _Se񯲟? Are we not allcomrades?' I doubt whether it made his job any easier.
12575,6,Meanwhile the rawrecruits were getting no military training that could be of theslightest use to them.
12576,6,"I had been told that foreigners were not obligedto attend 'instruction' (the Spaniards, I noticed, had a pathetic beliefthat all foreigners knew more of military matters than themselves), butnaturally I turned out with the others."
12577,6,I was very anxious to learn howto use a machine-gun; it was a weapon I had never had a chance tohandle.
12578,6,To my dismay I found that we were taught nothing about the useof weapons.
12579,6,"The so-called instruction was simply parade-ground drill ofthe most antiquated, stupid kind; right turn, left turn, about turn,marching at attention in column of threes and all the rest of thatuseless nonsense which I had learned when I was fifteen years old."
12580,6,"Itwas an extraordinary form for the training of a guerilla army to take.Obviously if you have only a few days in which to train a soldier, youmust teach him the things he will most need; how to take cover, how toadvance across open ground, how to mount guards and build aparapet--above all, how to use his weapons."
12581,6,"Yet this mob of eagerchildren, who were going to be thrown into the front line in a few days'time, were not even taught how to fire a rifle or pull the pin out of abomb."
12582,6,At the time I did not grasp that this was because there were noweapons to be had.
12583,6,In the P.O.U.M.
12584,6,militia the shortage of rifles was sodesperate that fresh troops reaching the front always had to take theirrifles from the troops they relieved in the line.
12585,6,"In the whole of theLenin Barracks there were, I believe, no rifles except those used by thesentries.After a few days, though still a complete rabble by any ordinarystandard, we were considered fit to be seen in public, and in themornings we were marched out to the public gardens on the hill beyondthe Plaza de Espa񡮠This was the common drill-ground of all the partymilitias, besides the Carabineros and the first contingents of the newlyformed Popular Army."
12586,6,Up in the public gardens it was a strange andheartening sight.
12587,6,"Down every path and alley-way, amid the formalflower-beds, squads and companies of men marched stiffly to and fro,throwing out their chests and trying desperately to look like soldiers.All of them were unarmed and none completely in uniform, though on mostof them the militia uniform was breaking out in patches here and there.The procedure was always very much the same."
12588,6,"For three hours we struttedto and fro (the Spanish marching step is very short and rapid), then wehalted, broke the ranks, and flocked thirstily to a little grocer's shopwhich was half-way down the hill and was doing a roaring trade in cheapwine."
12589,6,Everyone was very friendly to me.
12590,6,"As an Englishman I was somethingof a curiosity, and the Carabinero officers made much of me and stood medrinks."
12591,6,"Meanwhile, whenever I could get our lieutenant into a corner, Iwas clamouring to be instructed in the use of a machine-gun."
12592,6,I used todrag my Hugo's dictionary out of my pocket and start on him in myvillainous Spanish:'_Yo s頭anejar fusil.
12593,6,No s頭anejar ametralladora.
12594,6,Quiero apprenderametralladora.
12595,6,Quᮤo vamos apprender ametralladora?_'The answer was always a harassed smile and a promise that there shouldbe machine-gun instruction _ma񡮡_.
12596,6,Needless to say _ma񡮡_ nevercame.
12597,6,"Several days passed and the recruits learned to march in step andspring to attention almost smartly, but if they knew which end of arifle the bullet came out of, that was all they knew."
12598,6,One day an armedCarabinero strolled up to us when we were halting and allowed us toexamine his rifle.
12599,6,"It turned out that in the whole of my section no oneexcept myself even knew how to load the rifle, much less how to takeaim.All this time I was having the usual struggles with the Spanishlanguage."
12600,6,"Apart from myself there was only one Englishman at thebarracks, and nobody even among the officers spoke a word ofFrench."
12601,6,Things were not made easier for me by the fact that when mycompanions spoke to one another they generally spoke in Catalan.
12602,6,Theonly way I could get along was to carry everywhere a small dictionarywhich I whipped out of my pocket in moments of crisis.
12603,6,But I wouldsooner be a foreigner in Spain than in most countries.
12604,6,"How easy it is tomake friends in Spain! Within a day or two there was a score ofmilitiamen who called me by my Christian name, showed me the ropes, andoverwhelmed me with hospitality."
12605,6,I am not writing a book of propagandaand I do not want to idealize the P.O.U.M.
12606,6,militia.
12607,6,"The wholemilitia-system had serious faults, and the men themselves were a mixedlot, for by this time voluntary recruitment was falling off and many ofthe best men were already at the front or dead."
12608,6,There was always amongus a certain percentage who were completely useless.
12609,6,"Boys of fifteenwere being brought up for enlistment by their parents, quite openly forthe sake of the ten pesetas a day which was the militiaman's wage; alsofor the sake of the bread which the militia received in plenty and couldsmuggle home to their parents."
12610,6,"But I defy anyone to be thrown as I wasamong the Spanish working class--I ought perhaps to say the Catalanworking class, for apart from a few Arag󮥳e and Andalusians I mixedonly with Catalans--and not be struck by their essential decency; aboveall, their straightforwardness and generosity."
12611,6,"A Spaniard's generosity,in the ordinary sense of the word, is at times almost embarrassing."
12612,6,Ifyou ask him for a cigarette he will force the whole packet upon you.
12613,6,"Andbeyond this there is generosity in a deeper sense, a real largeness ofspirit, which I have met with again and again in the most unpromisingcircumstances."
12614,6,Some of the journalists and other foreigners whotravelled in Spain during the war have declared that in secret theSpaniards were bitterly jealous of foreign aid.
12615,6,All I can say is that Inever observed anything of the kind.
12616,6,I remember that a few days before Ileft the barracks a group of men returned on leave from the front.
12617,6,"Theywere talking excitedly about their experiences and were full ofenthusiasm for some French troops who had been next to them at Huesca.The French were very brave, they said; adding enthusiastically: '_M᳊valientes que nosotros_'--'Braver than we are!' Of course I demurred,whereupon they explained that the French knew more of the art ofwar--were more expert with bombs, machine-guns, and so forth."
12618,6,Yet theremark was significant.
12619,6,An Englishman would cut his hand off sooner thansay a thing like that.Every foreigner who served in the militia spent his first few weeks inlearning to love the Spaniards and in being exasperated by certain oftheir characteristics.
12620,6,In the front line my own exasperation sometimesreached the pitch of fury.
12621,6,"The Spaniards are good at many things, butnot at making war."
12622,6,"All foreigners alike are appalled by theirinefficiency, above all their maddening unpunctuality."
12623,6,"The one Spanishword that no foreigner can avoid learning is _ma񡮡_--'tomorrow'(literally, 'the morning')."
12624,6,"Whenever it is conceivably possible, thebusiness of today is put off until _ma񡮡_."
12625,6,This is so notorious thateven the Spaniards themselves make jokes about it.
12626,6,"In Spain nothing,from a meal to a battle, ever happens at the appointed time."
12627,6,"As ageneral rule things happen too late, but just occasionally--just so thatyou shan't even be able to depend on their happening late--they happentoo early."
12628,6,"A train which is due to leave at eight will normally leave atany time between nine and ten, but perhaps once a week, thanks to someprivate whim of the engine-driver, it leaves at half past seven."
12629,6,Suchthings can be a little trying.
12630,6,"In theory I rather admire the Spaniardsfor not sharing our Northern time-neurosis; but unfortunately I share itmyself.After endless rumours, _ma񡮡s_, and delays we were suddenly orderedto the front at two hours' notice, when much of our equipment was stillunissued."
12631,6,There were terrible tumults in the quartermaster's store; inthe end numbers of men had to leave without their full equipment.
12632,6,Thebarracks had promptly filled with women who seemed to have sprung upfrom the ground and were helping their men-folk to roll their blanketsand pack their kit-bags.
12633,6,"It was rather humiliating that I had to beshown how to put on my new leather cartridge-boxes by a Spanish girl,the wife of Williams, the other English militiaman."
12634,6,"She was a gentle,dark-eyed, intensely feminine creature who looked as though herlife-work was to rock a cradle, but who as a matter of fact had foughtbravely in the street-battles of July."
12635,6,"At this time she was carrying ababy which was born just ten months after the outbreak of war and hadperhaps been begotten behind a barricade.The train was due to leave at eight, and it was about ten past eightwhen the harassed, sweating officers managed to marshal us in thebarrack square."
12636,6,"I remember very vividly the torchlit scene--the uproarand excitement, the red flags flapping in the torchlight, the massedranks of militiamen with their knapsacks on their backs and their rolledblankets worn bandolier-wise across the shoulder; and the shouting andthe clatter of boots and tin pannikins, and then a tremendous andfinally successful hissing for silence; and then some politicalcommissar standing beneath a huge rolling red banner and making us aspeech in Catalan."
12637,6,"Finally they marched us to the station, taking thelongest route, three or four miles, so as to show us to the whole town.In the Ramblas they halted us while a borrowed band played somerevolutionary tune or other."
12638,6,"Once again the conquering-herostuff--shouting and enthusiasm, red flags and red and black flagseverywhere, friendly crowds thronging the pavement to have a look at us,women waving from the windows."
12639,6,"How natural it all seemed then; howremote and improbable now! The train was packed so tight with men thatthere was barely room even on the floor, let alone on the seats."
12640,6,At thelast moment Williams's wife came rushing down the platform and gave us abottle of wine and a foot of that bright red sausage which tastes ofsoap and gives you diarrhoea.
12641,6,"The train crawled out of Catalonia and onto the plateau of Arag󮠡t the normal wartime speed of something undertwenty kilometres an hour.Chapter 2Barbastro, though a long way from the front line, looked bleak andchipped."
12642,6,"Swarms of militiamen in shabby uniforms wandered up and downthe streets, trying to keep warm."
12643,6,On a ruinous wall I came upon a posterdating from the previous year and announcing that 'six handsome bulls'would be killed in the arena on such and such a date.
12644,6,"How forlorn itsfaded colours looked! Where were the handsome bulls and the handsomebull-fighters now? It appeared that even in Barcelona there were hardlyany bullfights nowadays; for some reason all the best matadors wereFascists.They sent my company by lorry to Sietamo, then westward to Alcubierre,which was just behind the line fronting Zaragoza."
12645,6,"Sietamo had beenfought over three times before the Anarchists finally took it inOctober, and parts of it were smashed to pieces by shell-fire and mostof the houses pockmarked by rifle-bullets."
12646,6,We were 1500 feet abovesea-level now.
12647,6,"It was beastly cold, with dense mists that came swirlingup from nowhere."
12648,6,Between Sietamo and Alcubierre the lorry-driver losthis way (this was one of the regular features of the war) and we werewandering for hours in the mist.
12649,6,It was late at night when we reachedAlcubierre.
12650,6,Somebody shepherded us through morasses of mud into amule-stable where we dug ourselves down into the chaff and promptly fellasleep.
12651,6,"Chaff is not bad to sleep in when it is clean, not so good ashay but better than straw."
12652,6,"It was only in the morning light that Idiscovered that the chaff was full of breadcrusts, torn newspapers,bones, dead rats, and jagged milk tins.We were near the front line now, near enough to smell the characteristicsmell of war--in my experience a smell of excrement and decaying food.Alcubierre had never been shelled and was in a better state than most ofthe villages immediately behind the line."
12653,6,Yet I believe that even inpeacetime you could not travel in that part of Spain without beingstruck by the peculiar squalid misery of the Arag󮥳e villages.
12654,6,"Theyare built like fortresses, a mass of mean little houses of mud and stonehuddling round the church, and even in spring you see hardly a floweranywhere; the houses have no gardens, only back-yards where ragged fowlsskate over the beds of mule-dung."
12655,6,"It was vile weather, with alternatemist and rain."
12656,6,"The narrow earth roads had been churned into a sea ofmud, in places two feet deep, through which the lorries struggled withracing wheels and the peasants led their clumsy carts which were pulledby strings of mules, sometimes as many as six in a string, alwayspulling tandem."
12657,6,The constant come-and-go of troops had reduced thevillage to a state of unspeakable filth.
12658,6,"It did not possess and neverhad possessed such a thing as a lavatory or a drain of any kind, andthere was not a square yard anywhere where you could tread withoutwatching your step."
12659,6,The church had long been used as a latrine; so hadall the fields for a quarter of a mile round.
12660,6,I never think of my firsttwo months at war without thinking of wintry stubble fields whose edgesare crusted with dung.Two days passed and no rifles were issued to us.
12661,6,"When you had been tothe Comite de Guerra and inspected the row of holes in the wall-holesmade by rifle-volleys, various Fascists having been executed there--youhad seen all the sights that Alcubierre contained."
12662,6,Up in the front linethings were obviously quiet; very few wounded were coming in.
12663,6,"The chiefexcitement was the arrival of Fascist deserters, who were brought underguard from the front line."
12664,6,"Many of the troops opposite us on this partof the line were not Fascists at all, merely wretched conscripts who hadbeen doing their military service at the time when war broke out andwere only too anxious to escape."
12665,6,Occasionally small batches of them tookthe risk of slipping across to our lines.
12666,6,No doubt more would have doneso if their relatives had not been in Fascist territory.
12667,6,These deserterswere the first 'real' Fascists I had ever seen.
12668,6,"It struck me that theywere indistinguishable from ourselves, except that they wore khakioveralls."
12669,6,"They were always ravenously hungry when they arrived--naturalenough after a day or two of dodging about in no man's land, but it wasalways triumphantly pointed to as a proof that the Fascist troops werestarving."
12670,6,I watched one of them being fed in a peasant's house.
12671,6,It wassomehow rather a pitiful sight.
12672,6,"A tall boy of twenty, deeply windburnt,with his clothes in rags, crouched over the fire shovelling apannikinful of stew into himself at desperate speed; and all the whilehis eyes flitted nervously round the ring of militiamen who stoodwatching him."
12673,6,I think he still half-believed that we were bloodthirsty'Reds' and were going to shoot him as soon as he had finished his meal;the armed man who guarded him kept stroking his shoulder and makingreassuring noises.
12674,6,On one memorable day fifteen deserters arrived in asingle batch.
12675,6,They were led through the village in triumph with a manriding in front of them on a white horse.
12676,6,I managed to take a ratherblurry photograph which was stolen from me later.On our third morning in Alcubierre the rifles arrived.
12677,6,A sergeant with acoarse dark-yellow face was handing them out in the mule-stable.
12678,6,I got ashock of dismay when I saw the thing they gave me.
12679,6,"It was a GermanMauser dated 1896--more than forty years old! It was rusty, the bolt wasstiff, the wooden barrel-guard was split; one glance down the muzzleshowed that it was corroded and past praying for."
12680,6,"Most of the rifleswere equally bad, some of them even worse, and no attempt was made togive the best weapons to the men who knew how to use them."
12681,6,"The bestrifle of the lot, only ten years old, was given to a half-witted littlebeast of fifteen, known to everyone as the _maric󮟠(Nancy-boy)."
12682,6,"Thesergeant gave us five minutes' 'instruction', which consisted inexplaining how you loaded a rifle and how you took the bolt to pieces.Many of the militiamen had never had a gun in their hands before, andvery few, I imagine, knew what the sights were for."
12683,6,"Cartridges werehanded out, fifty to a man, and then the ranks were formed and westrapped our kits on our backs and set out for the front line, aboutthree miles away.The _centuria_, eighty men and several dogs, wound raggedly up the road.Every militia column had at least one dog attached to it as a mascot.One wretched brute that marched with us had had P.O.U.M."
12684,6,branded on itin huge letters and slunk along as though conscious that there wassomething wrong with its appearance.
12685,6,"At the head of the column, besidethe red flag, Georges Kopp, the stout Belgian _commandante_, was riding ablack horse; a little way ahead a youth from the brigand-like militiacavalry pranced to and fro, galloping up every piece of rising groundand posing himself in picturesque attitudes at the summit."
12686,6,"The splendidhorses of the Spanish cavalry had been captured in large numbers duringthe revolution and handed over to the militia, who, of course, were busyriding them to death.The road wound between yellow infertile fields, untouched since lastyear's harvest."
12687,6,Ahead of us was the low sierra that lies betweenAlcubierre and Zaragoza.
12688,6,"We were getting near the front line now, nearthe bombs, the machine-guns, and the mud."
12689,6,In secret I was frightened.
12690,6,"Iknew the line was quiet at present, but unlike most of the men about meI was old enough to remember the Great War, though not old enough tohave fought in it."
12691,6,"War, to me, meant roaring projectiles and skippingshards of steel; above all it meant mud, lice, hunger, and cold."
12692,6,"It iscurious, but I dreaded the cold much more than I dreaded the enemy."
12693,6,"Thethought of it had been haunting me all the time I was in Barcelona; Ihad even lain awake at nights thinking of the cold in the trenches, thestand-to's in the grisly dawns, the long hours on sentry-go with afrosted rifle, the icy mud that would slop over my boot-tops."
12694,6,"I admit,too, that I felt a kind of horror as I looked at the people I wasmarching among."
12695,6,You cannot possibly conceive what a rabble we looked.
12696,6,Westraggled along with far less cohesion than a flock of sheep; before wehad gone two miles the rear of the column was out of sight.
12697,6,"And quitehalf of the so-called men were children--but I mean literally children,of sixteen years old at the very most."
12698,6,Yet they were all happy andexcited at the prospect of getting to the front at last.
12699,6,"As we nearedthe line the boys round the red flag in front began to utter shouts of'_Visca P.O.U.M.!_' '_Fascistas--maricones_!' and so forth--shouts whichwere meant to be war-like and menacing, but which, from those childishthroats, sounded as pathetic as the cries of kittens."
12700,6,It seemed dreadfulthat the defenders of the Republic should be this mob of ragged childrencarrying worn-out rifles which they did not know how to use.
12701,6,I rememberwondering what would happen if a Fascist aeroplane passed our waywhether the airman would even bother to dive down and give us a burstfrom his machine-gun.
12702,6,Surely even from the air he could see that we werenot real soldiers?As the road struck into the sierra we branched off to the right andclimbed a narrow mule-track that wound round the mountain-side.
12703,6,"Thehills in that part of Spain are of a queer formation, horseshoe-shapedwith flattish tops and very steep sides running down into immenseravines."
12704,6,"On the higher slopes nothing grows except stunted shrubs andheath, with the white bones of the limestone sticking out everywhere."
12705,6,"Thefront line here was not a continuous line of trenches, which would havebeen impossible in such mountainous country; it was simply a chain offortified posts, always known as 'positions', perched on each hill-top.In the distance you could see our 'position' at the crown of thehorseshoe; a ragged barricade of sand-bags, a red flag fluttering, thesmoke of dug-out fires."
12706,6,"A little nearer, and you could smell a sickeningsweetish stink that lived in my nostrils for weeks afterwards."
12707,6,"Into thecleft immediately behind the position all the refuse of months had beentipped--a deep festering bed of breadcrusts, excrement, and rusty tins.The company we were relieving were getting their kits together."
12708,6,"They hadbeen three months in the line; their uniforms were caked with mud, theirboots falling to pieces, their faces mostly bearded."
12709,6,"The captaincommanding the position, Levinski by name, but known to everyone asBenjamin, and by birth a Polish Jew, but speaking French as his nativelanguage, crawled out of his dug-out and greeted us."
12710,6,"He was a shortyouth of about twenty-five, with stiff black hair and a pale eager facewhich at this period of the war was always very dirty."
12711,6,A few straybullets were cracking high overhead.
12712,6,"The position was a semi-circularenclosure about fifty yards across, with a parapet that was partlysand-bags and partly lumps of limestone."
12713,6,There were thirty or fortydug-outs running into the ground like rat-holes.
12714,6,"Williams, myself, andWilliams's Spanish brother-in-law made a swift dive for the nearestunoccupied dug-out that looked habitable."
12715,6,"Somewhere in front anoccasional rifle banged, making queer rolling echoes among the stonyhills."
12716,6,We had just dumped our kits and were crawling out of the dug-outwhen there was another bang and one of the children of our companyrushed back from the parapet with his face pouring blood.
12717,6,He had firedhis rifle and had somehow managed to blow out the bolt; his scalp wastorn to ribbons by the splinters of the burst cartridge-case.
12718,6,"It was ourfirst casualty, and, characteristically, self-inflicted.In the afternoon we did our first guard and Benjamin showed us round theposition."
12719,6,"In front of the parapet there ran a system of narrow trencheshewn out of the rock, with extremely primitive loopholes made of pilesof limestone."
12720,6,"There were twelve sentries, placed at various points inthe trench and behind the inner parapet."
12721,6,"In front of the trench was thebarbed wire, and then the hillside slid down into a seemingly bottomlessravine; opposite were naked hills, in places mere cliffs of rock, allgrey and wintry, with no life anywhere, not even a bird."
12722,6,"I peeredcautiously through a loophole, trying to find the Fascist trench.'Where are the enemy?'Benjamin waved his hand expansively."
12723,6,'Over zere.' (Benjamin spokeEnglish--terrible English.)'But _where?_'According to my ideas of trench warfare the Fascists would be fifty or ahundred yards away.
12724,6,I could see nothing--seemingly their trenches werevery well concealed.
12725,6,"Then with a shock of dismay I saw where Benjaminwas pointing; on the opposite hill-top, beyond the ravine, seven hundredmetres away at the very least, the tiny outline of a parapet and ared-and-yellow flag--the Fascist position."
12726,6,I was indescribablydisappointed.
12727,6,We were nowhere near them! At that range our rifles werecompletely useless.
12728,6,"But at this moment there was a shout of excitement.Two Fascists, greyish figurines in the distance, were scrambling up thenaked hill-side opposite."
12729,6,"Benjamin grabbed the nearest man's rifle, tookaim, and pulled the trigger."
12730,6,Click! A dud cartridge; I thought it a badomen.The new sentries were no sooner in the trench than they began firing aterrific fusillade at nothing in particular.
12731,6,"I could see the Fascists,tiny as ants, dodging to and fro behind their parapet, and sometimes ablack dot which was a head would pause for a moment, impudently exposed.It was obviously no use firing."
12732,6,"But presently the sentry on my left,leaving his post in the typical Spanish fashion, sidled up to me andbegan urging me to fire."
12733,6,I tried to explain that at that range and withthese rifles you could not hit a man except by accident.
12734,6,"But he was onlya child, and he kept motioning with his rifle towards one of the dots,grinning as eagerly as a dog that expects a pebble to be thrown."
12735,6,FinallyI put my sights up to seven hundred and let fly.
12736,6,The dot disappeared.I hope it went near enough to make him jump.
12737,6,It was the first time inmy life that I had fired a gun at a human being.Now that I had seen the front I was profoundly disgusted.
12738,6,They calledthis war! And we were hardly even in touch with the enemy! I made noattempt to keep my head below the level of the trench.
12739,6,"A little whilelater, however, a bullet shot past my ear with a vicious crack andbanged into the parados behind."
12740,6,Alas! I ducked.
12741,6,"All my life I had swornthat I would not duck the first time a bullet passed over me; but themovement appears to be instinctive, and almost everybody does it atleast once.Chapter 3In trench warfare five things are important: firewood, food, tobacco,candles, and the enemy."
12742,6,"In winter on the Zaragoza front they wereimportant in that order, with the enemy a bad last."
12743,6,"Except at night,when a surprise-attack was always conceivable, nobody bothered about theenemy."
12744,6,They were simply remote black insects whom one occasionally sawhopping to and fro.
12745,6,The real preoccupation of both armies was trying tokeep warm.I ought to say in passing that all the time I was in Spain I saw verylittle fighting.
12746,6,"I was on the Arag󮠦ront from January to May, andbetween January and late March little or nothing happened on that front,except at Teruel."
12747,6,"In March there was heavy fighting round Huesca, but Ipersonally played only a minor part in it."
12748,6,"Later, in June, there was thedisastrous attack on Huesca in which several thousand men were killed ina single day, but I had been wounded and disabled before that happened.The things that one normally thinks of as the horrors of war seldomhappened to me."
12749,6,"No aeroplane ever dropped a bomb anywhere near me, I donot think a shell ever exploded within fifty yards of me, and I was onlyin hand-to-hand fighting once (once is once too often, I may say)."
12750,6,"Ofcourse I was often under heavy machine-gun fire, but usually at longishranges."
12751,6,"Even at Huesca you were generally safe enough if you tookreasonable precautions.Up here, in the hills round Zaragoza, it was simply the mingled boredomand discomfort of stationary warfare."
12752,6,"A life as uneventful as a cityclerk's, and almost as regular."
12753,6,"Sentry-go, patrols, digging; digging,patrols, sentry-go."
12754,6,"On every hill-top, Fascist or Loyalist, a knot ofragged, dirty men shivering round their flag and trying to keep warm.And all day and night the meaningless bullets wandering across the emptyvalleys and only by some rare improbable chance getting home on a humanbody.Often I used to gaze round the wintry landscape and marvel at thefutility of it all."
12755,6,"The inconclusiveness of such a kind of war! Earlier,about October, there had been savage fighting for all these hills; then,because the lack of men and arms, especially artillery, made anylarge-scale operation impossible, each army had dug itself in andsettled down on the hill-tops it had won."
12756,6,"Over to our right there was asmall outpost, also P.O.U.M., and on the spur to our left, at seveno'clock of us, a P.S.U.C."
12757,6,position faced a taller spur with severalsmall Fascist posts dotted on its peaks.
12758,6,The so-called line zigzagged toand fro in a pattern that would have been quite unintelligible if everyposition had not flown a flag.
12759,6,The P.O.U.M.
12760,6,and P.S.U.C.
12761,6,"flags were red,those of the Anarchists red and black; the Fascists generally flew themonarchist flag (red-yellow-red), but occasionally they flew the flagof the Republic (red-yellow-purple).* The scenery was stupendous,if you could forget that every mountain-top was occupied by troops andwas therefore littered with tin cans and crusted with dung."
12762,6,"To the rightof us the sierra bent south-eastwards and made way for the wide, veinedvalley that stretched across to Huesca."
12763,6,"In the middle of the plain a fewtiny cubes sprawled like a throw of dice; this was the town of Robres,which was in Loyalist possession."
12764,6,"Often in the mornings the valley washidden under seas of cloud, out of which the hills rose flat and blue,giving the landscape a strange resemblance to a photographic negative.Beyond Huesca there were more hills of the same formation as our own,streaked with a pattern of snow which altered day by day."
12765,6,"In the fardistance the monstrous peaks of the Pyrenees, where the snow nevermelts, seemed to float upon nothing."
12766,6,Even down in the plain everythinglooked dead and bare.
12767,6,The hills opposite us were grey and wrinkled likethe skins of elephants.
12768,6,Almost always the sky was empty of birds.
12769,6,I donot think I have ever seen a country where there were so few birds.
12770,6,"Theonly birds one saw at any time were a kind of magpie, and the coveys ofpartridges that startled one at night with their sudden whirring, and,very rarely, the flights of eagles that drifted slowly over, generallyfollowed by rifle-shots which they did not deign to notice.[* Footnote: An errata note found in Orwell's papers after his death:""Am not now completely certain that I ever saw Fascists flying therepublican flag, though I _think_ they sometimes flew it with a smallimposed swastika.""]At night and in misty weather, patrols were sent out in the valleybetween ourselves and the Fascists."
12771,6,"The job was not popular, it was toocold and too easy to get lost, and I soon found that I could get leaveto go out on patrol as often as I wished."
12772,6,In the huge jagged ravinesthere were no paths or tracks of any kind; you could only find your wayabout by making successive journeys and noting fresh landmarks eachtime.
12773,6,"As the bullet flies the nearest Fascist post was seven hundredmetres from our own, but it was a mile and a half by the onlypracticable route."
12774,6,"It was rather fun wandering about the dark valleyswith the stray bullets flying high overhead like redshanks whistling.Better than night-time were the heavy mists, which often lasted all dayand which had a habit of clinging round the hill-tops and leaving thevalleys clear."
12775,6,"When you were anywhere near the Fascist lines you had tocreep at a snail's pace; it was very difficult to move quietly on thosehill-sides, among the crackling shrubs and tinkling limestones."
12776,6,It wasonly at the third or fourth attempt that I managed to find my way to theFascist lines.
12777,6,"The mist was very thick, and I crept up to the barbedwire to listen."
12778,6,I could hear the Fascists talking and singing inside.Then to my alarm I heard several of them coming down the hill towardsme.
12779,6,"I cowered behind a bush that suddenly seemed very small, and triedto cock my rifle without noise."
12780,6,"However, they branched off and did notcome within sight of me."
12781,6,"Behind the bush where I was hiding I came uponvarious relics of the earlier fighting--a pile of empty cartridge-cases,a leather cap with a bullet-hole in it, and a red flag, obviously one ofour own."
12782,6,"I took it back to the position, where it was unsentimentallytorn up for cleaning-rags.I had been made a corporal, or _cabo_, as it was called, as soon as wereached the front, and was in command of a guard of twelve men."
12783,6,"It wasno sinecure, especially at first."
12784,6,The _centuria_ was an untrained mobcomposed mostly of boys in their teens.
12785,6,"Here and there in the militiayou came across children as young as eleven or twelve, usually refugeesfrom Fascist territory who had been enlisted as militiamen as theeasiest way of providing for them."
12786,6,"As a rule they were employed on lightwork in the rear, but sometimes they managed to worm their way to thefront line, where they were a public menace."
12787,6,I remember one little brutethrowing a hand-grenade into the dug-out fire 'for a joke'.
12788,6,"At MontePocero I do not think there was anyone younger than fifteen, but theaverage age must have been well under twenty."
12789,6,"Boys of this age oughtnever to be used in the front line, because they cannot stand the lackof sleep which is inseparable from trench warfare."
12790,6,"At the beginning itwas almost impossible to keep our position properly guarded at night.The wretched children of my section could only be roused by draggingthem out of their dug-outs feet foremost, and as soon as your back wasturned they left their posts and slipped into shelter; or they wouldeven, in spite of the frightful cold, lean up against the wall of thetrench and fall fast asleep."
12791,6,"Luckily the enemy were very unenterprising.There were nights when it seemed to me that our position could bestormed by twenty Boy Scouts armed with airguns, or twenty Girl Guidesarmed with battledores, for that matter.At this time and until much later the Catalan militias were still on thesame basis as they had been at the beginning of the war."
12792,6,"In the earlydays of Franco's revolt the militias had been hurriedly raised by thevarious trade unions and political parties; each was essentially apolitical organization, owing allegiance to its party as much as to thecentral Government."
12793,6,"When the Popular Army, which was a 'non-political'army organized on more or less ordinary lines, was raised at thebeginning of 1937, the party militias were theoretically incorporated init."
12794,6,"But for a long time the only changes that occurred were on paper;the new Popular Army troops did not reach the Arag󮠦ront in anynumbers till June, and until that time the militia-system remainedunchanged."
12795,6,The essential point of the system was social equality betweenofficers and men.
12796,6,"Everyone from general to private drew the same pay,ate the same food, wore the same clothes, and mingled on terms ofcomplete equality."
12797,6,"If you wanted to slap the general commanding thedivision on the back and ask him for a cigarette, you could do so, andno one thought it curious."
12798,6,In theory at any rate each militia was ademocracy and not a hierarchy.
12799,6,"It was understood that orders had to beobeyed, but it was also understood that when you gave an order you gaveit as comrade to comrade and not as superior to inferior."
12800,6,"There wereofficers and N.C.O.s but there was no military rank in the ordinarysense; no titles, no badges, no heel-clicking and saluting."
12801,6,They hadattempted to produce within the militias a sort of temporary workingmodel of the classless society.
12802,6,"Of course there was no perfect equality,but there was a nearer approach to it than I had ever seen or than Iwould have thought conceivable in time of war.But I admit that at first sight the state of affairs at the fronthorrified me."
12803,6,"How on earth could the war be won by an army of this type?It was what everyone was saying at the time, and though it was true itwas also unreasonable."
12804,6,For in the circumstances the militias could nothave been much better than they were.
12805,6,"A modern mechanized army does notspring up out of the ground, and if the Government had waited until ithad trained troops at its disposal, Franco would never have beenresisted."
12806,6,"Later it became the fashion to decry the militias, andtherefore to pretend that the faults which were due to lack of trainingand weapons were the result of the equalitarian system."
12807,6,"Actually, a newlyraised draft of militia was an undisciplined mob not because theofficers called the private 'Comrade' but because raw troops are_always_ an undisciplined mob."
12808,6,In practice the democratic'revolutionary' type of discipline is more reliable than might beexpected.
12809,6,In a workers' army discipline is theoretically voluntary.
12810,6,"Itis based on class-loyalty, whereas the discipline of a bourgeoisconscript army is based ultimately on fear."
12811,6,(The Popular Army thatreplaced the militias was midway between the two types.) In the militiasthe bullying and abuse that go on in an ordinary army would never havebeen tolerated for a moment.
12812,6,"The normal military punishments existed,but they were only invoked for very serious offences."
12813,6,When a man refusedto obey an order you did not immediately get him punished; you firstappealed to him in the name of comradeship.
12814,6,"Cynical people with noexperience of handling men will say instantly that this would never'work', but as a matter of fact it does 'work' in the long run."
12815,6,Thediscipline of even the worst drafts of militia visibly improved as timewent on.
12816,6,In January the job of keeping a dozen raw recruits up to themark almost turned my hair grey.
12817,6,"In May for a short while I wasacting-lieutenant in command of about thirty men, English and Spanish.We had all been under fire for months, and I never had the slightestdifficulty in getting an order obeyed or in getting men to volunteer fora dangerous job."
12818,6,"'Revolutionary' discipline depends on politicalconsciousness--on an understanding of _why_ orders must be obeyed; ittakes time to diffuse this, but it also takes time to drill a man intoan automaton on the barrack-square."
12819,6,The journalists who sneered at themilitia-system seldom remembered that the militias had to hold the linewhile the Popular Army was training in the rear.
12820,6,And it is a tribute tothe strength of 'revolutionary' discipline that the militias stayed inthe field at all.
12821,6,"For until about June 1937 there was nothing to keepthem there, except class loyalty."
12822,6,"Individual deserters could beshot--were shot, occasionally--but if a thousand men had decided to walkout of the line together there was no force to stop them."
12823,6,A conscriptarmy in the same circumstances--with its battle-police removed--wouldhave melted away.
12824,6,"Yet the militias held the line, though God knows theywon very few victories, and even individual desertions were not common.In four or five months in the P.O.U.M."
12825,6,"militia I only heard of four mendeserting, and two of those were fairly certainly spies who had enlistedto obtain information."
12826,6,"At the beginning the apparent chaos, the generallack of training, the fact that you often had to argue for five minutesbefore you could get an order obeyed, appalled and infuriated me."
12827,6,"I hadBritish Army ideas, and certainly the Spanish militias were very unlikethe British Army."
12828,6,"But considering the circumstances they were bettertroops than one had any right to expect.Meanwhile, firewood--always firewood."
12829,6,"Throughout that period there isprobably no entry in my diary that does not mention firewood, or ratherthe lack of it."
12830,6,"We were between two and three thousand feet abovesea-level, it was mid winter and the cold was unspeakable."
12831,6,"Thetemperature was not exceptionally low, on many nights it did not evenfreeze, and the wintry sun often shone for an hour in the middle of theday; but even if it was not really cold, I assure you that it seemed so.Sometimes there were shrieking winds that tore your cap off and twistedyour hair in all directions, sometimes there were mists that poured intothe trench like a liquid and seemed to penetrate your bones; frequentlyit rained, and even a quarter of an hour's rain was enough to makeconditions intolerable."
12832,6,"The thin skin of earth over the limestone turnedpromptly into a slippery grease, and as you were always walking on aslope it was impossible to keep your footing."
12833,6,"On dark nights I haveoften fallen half a dozen times in twenty yards; and this was dangerous,because it meant that the lock of one's rifle became jammed with mud.For days together clothes, boots, blankets, and rifles were more or lesscoated with mud."
12834,6,"I had brought as many thick clothes as I could carry,but many of the men were terribly underclad."
12835,6,"For the whole garrison,about a hundred men, there were only twelve great-coats, which had to behanded from sentry to sentry, and most of the men had only one blanket.One icy night I made a list in my diary of the clothes I was wearing."
12836,6,Itis of some interest as showing the amount of clothes the human body cancarry.
12837,6,"I was wearing a thick vest and pants, a flannel shirt, twopull-overs, a woollen jacket, a pigskin jacket, corduroy breeches,puttees, thick socks, boots, a stout trench-coat, a muffler, linedleather gloves, and a woollen cap."
12838,6,Nevertheless I was shivering like ajelly.
12839,6,But I admit I am unusually sensitive to cold.Firewood was the one thing that really mattered.
12840,6,The point about thefirewood was that there was practically no firewood to be had.
12841,6,"Ourmiserable mountain had not even at its best much vegetation, and formonths it had been ranged over by freezing militiamen, with the resultthat everything thicker than one's finger had long since been burnt.When we were not eating, sleeping, on guard, or on fatigue-duty we werein the valley behind the position, scrounging for fuel."
12842,6,"All my memoriesof that time are memories of scrambling up and down the almostperpendicular slopes, over the jagged limestone that knocked one's bootsto pieces, pouncing eagerly on tiny twigs of wood."
12843,6,Three peoplesearching for a couple of hours could collect enough fuel to keep thedug-out fire alight for about an hour.
12844,6,The eagerness of our search forfirewood turned us all into botanists.
12845,6,"We classified according to theirburning qualities every plant that grew on the mountainside; the variousheaths and grasses that were good to start a fire with but burnt out ina few minutes, the wild rosemary and the tiny whin bushes that wouldburn when the fire was well alight, the stunted oak tree, smaller than agooseberry bush, that was practically unburnable."
12846,6,"There was a kind ofdried-up reed that was very good for starting fires with, but these grewonly on the hill-top to the left of the position, and you had to gounder fire to get them."
12847,6,If the Fascist machine-gunners saw you they gaveyou a drum of ammunition all to yourself.
12848,6,"Generally their aim was highand the bullets sang overhead like birds, but sometime they crackled andchipped the limestone uncomfortably close, whereupon you flung yourselfon your face."
12849,6,"You went on gathering reeds, however; nothing mattered incomparison with firewood.Beside the cold the other discomforts seemed petty."
12850,6,Of course all of uswere permanently dirty.
12851,6,"Our water, like our food, came on mule-back fromAlcubierre, and each man's share worked out at about a quart a day."
12852,6,"Itwas beastly water, hardly more transparent than milk."
12853,6,"Theoretically itwas for drinking only, but I always stole a pannikinful for washing inthe mornings."
12854,6,I used to wash one day and shave the next; there was neverenough water for both.
12855,6,"The position stank abominably, and outside thelittle enclosure of the barricade there was excrement everywhere."
12856,6,"Someof the militiamen habitually defecated in the trench, a disgusting thingwhen one had to walk round it in the darkness."
12857,6,But the dirt neverworried me.
12858,6,Dirt is a thing people make too much fuss about.It is astonishing how quickly you get used to doing without ahandkerchief and to eating out of the tin pannikin in which you alsowash.
12859,6,Nor was sleeping in one's clothes any hardship after a day or two.It was of course impossible to take one's clothes and especially one'sboots off at night; one had to be ready to turn out instantly in case ofan attack.
12860,6,"In eighty nights I only took my clothes off three times,though I did occasionally manage to get them off in the daytime."
12861,6,"It wastoo cold for lice as yet, but rats and mice abounded."
12862,6,"It is often saidthat you don't find rats and mice in the same place, but you do whenthere is enough food for them.In other ways we were not badly off."
12863,6,The food was good enough and therewas plenty of wine.
12864,6,"Cigarettes were still being issued at the rate of apacket a day, matches were issued every other day, and there was even anissue of candles."
12865,6,"They were very thin candles, like those on a Christmascake, and were popularly supposed to have been looted from churches.Every dug-out was issued daily with three inches of candle, which wouldbum for about twenty minutes."
12866,6,"At that time it was still possible to buycandles, and I had brought several pounds of them with me."
12867,6,Later on thefamine of matches and candles made life a misery.
12868,6,You do not realize theimportance of these things until you lack them.
12869,6,"In a night-alarm, forinstance, when everyone in the dug-out is scrambling for his rifle andtreading on everybody else's face, being able to strike a light may makethe difference between life and death."
12870,6,Every militiaman possessed atinder-lighter and several yards of yellow wick.
12871,6,Next to his rifle itwas his most important possession.
12872,6,"The tinder-lighters had the greatadvantage that they could be struck in a wind, but they would onlysmoulder, so that they were no use for lighting a fire."
12873,6,"When the matchfamine was at its worst our only way of producing a flame was to pullthe bullet out of a cartridge and touch the cordite off with atinder-lighter.It was an extraordinary life that we were living--an extraordinary wayto be at war, if you could call it war."
12874,6,The whole militia chafed againstthe inaction and clamoured constantly to know why we were not allowed toattack.
12875,6,"But it was perfectly obvious that there would be no battle for along while yet, unless the enemy started it."
12876,6,"Georges Kopp, on hisperiodical tours of inspection, was quite frank with us."
12877,6,"'This is not awar,' he used to say, 'it is a comic opera with an occasional death.' Asa matter of fact the stagnation on the Arag󮠦ront had political causesof which I knew nothing at that time; but the purely militarydifficulties--quite apart from the lack of reserves of men--were obviousto anybody.To begin with, there was the nature of the country."
12878,6,"The front line, oursand the Fascists', lay in positions of immense natural strength, whichas a rule could only be approached from one side."
12879,6,"Provided a fewtrenches have been dug, such places cannot be taken by infantry, exceptin overwhelming numbers."
12880,6,In our own position or most of those round us adozen men with two machine-guns could have held off a battalion.
12881,6,"Perchedon the hill-tops as we were, we should have made lovely marks forartillery; but there was no artillery."
12882,6,"Sometimes I used to gaze roundthe landscape and long--oh, how passionately!--for a couple of batteriesof guns."
12883,6,One could have destroyed the enemy positions one after anotheras easily as smashing nuts with a hammer.
12884,6,But on our side the gunssimply did not exist.
12885,6,"The Fascists did occasionally manage to bring agun or two from Zaragoza and fire a very few shells, so few that theynever even found the range and the shells plunged harmlessly into theempty ravines."
12886,6,"Against machine-guns and without artillery there are onlythree things you can do: dig yourself in at a safe distance--fourhundred yards, say--advance across the open and be massacred, or makesmall-scale night-attacks that will not alter the general situation.Practically the alternatives are stagnation or suicide.And beyond this there was the complete lack of war materials of everydescription."
12887,6,It needs an effort to realize how badly the militias werearmed at this time.
12888,6,Any public school O.T.C.
12889,6,in England is far more likea modern army than we were.
12890,6,The badness of our weapons was soastonishing that it is worth recording in detail.For this sector of the front the entire artillery consisted of fourtrench-mortars with _fifteen rounds_ for each gun.
12891,6,"Of course they werefar too precious to be fired and the mortars were kept in Alcubierre.There were machine-guns at the rate of approximately one to fifty men;they were oldish guns, but fairly accurate up to three or four hundredyards."
12892,6,"Beyond this we had only rifles, and the majority of the rifleswere scrap-iron."
12893,6,There were three types of rifle in use.
12894,6,The first wasthe long Mauser.
12895,6,"These were seldom less than twenty years old, theirsights were about as much use as a broken speedometer, and in most ofthem the rifling was hopelessly corroded; about one rifle in ten was notbad, however."
12896,6,"Then there was the short Mauser, or mousqueton, really acavalry weapon."
12897,6,"These were more popular than the others because theywere lighter to carry and less nuisance in a trench, also because theywere comparatively new and looked efficient."
12898,6,Actually they were almostuseless.
12899,6,"They were made out of reassembled parts, no bolt belonged to itsrifle, and three-quarters of them could be counted on to jam after fiveshots."
12900,6,There were also a few Winchester rifles.
12901,6,"These were nice to shootwith, but they were wildly inaccurate, and as their cartridges had noclips they could only be fired one shot at a time."
12902,6,"Ammunition was soscarce that each man entering the line was only issued with fiftyrounds, and most of it was exceedingly bad."
12903,6,The Spanish-made cartridgeswere all refills and would jam even the best rifles.
12904,6,"The Mexicancartridges were better and were therefore reserved for the machine-guns.Best of all was the German-made ammunition, but as this came only fromprisoners and deserters there was not much of it."
12905,6,"I always kept a clipof German or Mexican ammunition in my pocket for use in an emergency.But in practice when the emergency came I seldom fired my rifle; I wastoo frightened of the beastly thing jamming and too anxious to reserveat any rate one round that would go off.We had no tin hats, no bayonets, hardly any revolvers or pistols, andnot more than one bomb between five or ten men."
12906,6,The bomb in use at thistime was a frightful object known as the 'F.A.I.
12907,6,"bomb', it having beenproduced by the Anarchists in the early days of the war."
12908,6,"It was on theprinciple of a Mills bomb, but the lever was held down not by a pin buta piece of tape."
12909,6,You broke the tape and then got rid of the bomb withthe utmost possible speed.
12910,6,It was said of these bombs that they were'impartial'; they killed the man they were thrown at and the man whothrew them.
12911,6,"There were several other types, even more primitive butprobably a little less dangerous--to the thrower, I mean."
12912,6,It was nottill late March that I saw a bomb worth throwing.And apart from weapons there was a shortage of all the minor necessitiesof war.
12913,6,"We had no maps or charts, for instance."
12914,6,"Spain has never beenfully surveyed, and the only detailed maps of this area were the oldmilitary ones, which were almost all in the possession of the Fascists.We had no range-finders, no telescopes, no periscopes, no field-glassesexcept for a few privately-owned pairs, no flares or Very lights, nowire-cutters, no armourers' tools, hardly even any cleaning materials.The Spaniards seemed never to have heard of a pull-through and looked onin surprise when I constructed one."
12915,6,"When you wanted your rifle cleanedyou took it to the sergeant, who possessed a long brass ramrod which wasinvariably bent and therefore scratched the rifling."
12916,6,There was not evenany gun oil.
12917,6,"You greased your rifle with olive oil, when you could gethold of it; at different times I have greased mine with vaseline, withcold cream, and even with bacon-fat."
12918,6,"Moreover, there were no lanterns orelectric torches--at this time there was not, I believe, such a thing asan electric torch throughout the whole of our sector of the front, andyou could not buy one nearer than Barcelona, and only with difficultyeven there.As time went on, and the desultory rifle-fire rattled among the hills, Ibegan to wonder with increasing scepticism whether anything would everhappen to bring a bit of life, or rather a bit of death, into thiscock-eyed war."
12919,6,"It was pneumonia that we were fighting against, notagainst men."
12920,6,When the trenches are more than five hundred yards apart noone gets hit except by accident.
12921,6,"Of course there were casualties, butthe majority of them were self-inflicted."
12922,6,"If I remember rightly, thefirst five men I saw wounded in Spain were all wounded by our ownweapons--I don't mean intentionally, but owing to accident orcarelessness."
12923,6,Our worn-out rifles were a danger in themselves.
12924,6,Some ofthem had a nasty trick of going off if the butt was tapped on theground; I saw a man shoot himself through the hand owing to this.
12925,6,And inthe darkness the raw recruits were always firing at one another.
12926,6,Oneevening when it was barely even dusk a sentry let fly at me from adistance of twenty yards; but he missed me by a yard--goodness knows howmany times the Spanish standard of marksmanship has saved my life.Another time I had gone out on patrol in the mist and had carefullywarned the guard commander beforehand.
12927,6,"But in coming back I stumbledagainst a bush, the startled sentry called out that the Fascists werecoming, and I had the pleasure of hearing the guard commander ordereveryone to open rapid fire in my direction."
12928,6,Of course I lay down andthe bullets went harmlessly over me.
12929,6,"Nothing will convince a Spaniard,at least a young Spaniard, that fire-arms are dangerous."
12930,6,"Once, ratherlater than this, I was photographing some machine-gunners with theirgun, which was pointed directly towards me.'Don't fire,' I said half-jokingly as I focused the camera.'Oh no, we won't fire.'The next moment there was a frightful roar and a stream of bullets torepast my face so close that my cheek was stung by grains of cordite."
12931,6,"Itwas unintentional, but the machine-gunners considered it a great joke.Yet only a few days earlier they had seen a mule-driver accidentallyshot by a political delegate who was playing the fool with an automaticpistol and had put five bullets in the mule-driver's lungs.The difficult passwords which the army was using at this time were aminor source of danger."
12932,6,They were those tiresome double passwords inwhich one word has to be answered by another.
12933,6,"Usually they were of anelevating and revolutionary nature, such as _Cultura--progreso_, or_Seremos--invencibles_, and it was often impossible to get illiteratesentries to remember these highfalutin' words."
12934,6,"One night, I remember,the password was _Catalu񡭭heroica_, and a moonfaced peasant lad namedJaime Domenech approached me, greatly puzzled, and asked me to explain.'_Heroica_--what does _hroica_ mean?'I told him that it meant the same as _valiente_."
12935,6,"A little while later hewas stumbling up the trench in the darkness, and the sentry challengedhim:'_Alto! Catalu񡟡''_Valiente!_' yelled Jaime, certain that he was saying the right thing.Bang!However, the sentry missed him."
12936,6,"In this war everyone always did misseveryone else, when it was humanly possible.Chapter 4When I had been about three weeks in the line a contingent of twenty orthirty men, sent out from England by the I.L.P., arrived at Alcubierre,and in order to keep the English on this front together Williams and Iwere sent to join them."
12937,6,"Our new position was at Monte Oscuro, severalmiles farther west and within sight of Zaragoza.The position was perched on a sort of razor-back of limestone withdug-outs driven horizontally into the cliff like sand-martins'nests."
12938,6,"Theywent into the ground for prodigious distances, and inside they werepitch dark and so low that you could not even kneel in them, let alonestand."
12939,6,"On the peaks to the left of us there were two more P.O.U.M.positions, one of them an object of fascination to every man in theline, because there were three militiawomen there who did the cooking.These women were not exactly beautiful, but it was found necessary toput the position out of bounds to men of other companies."
12940,6,Five hundredyards to our right there was a P.S.U.C.
12941,6,post at the bend of theAlcubierre road.
12942,6,It was just here that the road changed hands.
12943,6,"At nightyou could watch the lamps of our supply-lorries winding out fromAlcubierre and, simultaneously, those of the Fascists coming fromZaragoza."
12944,6,"You could see Zaragoza itself, a thin string of lights likethe lighted portholes of a ship, twelve miles south-westward."
12945,6,"TheGovernment troops had gazed at it from that distance since August 1936,and they are gazing at it still.There were about thirty of ourselves, including one Spaniard (Ramon,Williams's brother-in-law), and there were a dozen Spanishmachine-gunners."
12946,6,"Apart from the one or two inevitable nuisances--for, aseveryone knows, war attracts riff-raff--the English were anexceptionally good crowd, both physically and mentally."
12947,6,Perhaps the bestof the bunch was Bob Smillie--the grandson of the famous miners'leader--who afterwards died such an evil and meaningless death inValencia.
12948,6,"It says a lot for the Spanish character that the English andthe Spaniards always got on well together, in spite of the languagedifficulty."
12949,6,"All Spaniards, we discovered, knew two English expressions.One was 'O.K., baby', the other was a word used by the Barcelona whoresin their dealings with English sailors, and I am afraid the compositorswould not print it.Once again there was nothing happening all along the line: only therandom crack of bullets and, very rarely, the crash of a Fascist mortarthat sent everyone running to the top trench to see which hill theshells were bursting on."
12950,6,"The enemy was somewhat closer to us here,perhaps three or four hundred yards away."
12951,6,"Their nearest position wasexactly opposite ours, with a machine-gun nest whose loopholesconstantly tempted one to waste cartridges."
12952,6,"The Fascists seldom botheredwith rifle-shots, but sent bursts of accurate machine-gun fire at anyonewho exposed himself."
12953,6,Nevertheless it was ten days or more before we hadour first casualty.
12954,6,"The troops opposite us were Spaniards, but accordingto the deserters there were a few German N.C.O.S."
12955,6,among them.
12956,6,"At sometime in the past there had also been Moors there--poor devils, how theymust have felt the cold!--for out in no man's land there was a dead Moorwho was one of the sights of the locality."
12957,6,"A mile or two to the left ofus the line ceased to be continuous and there was a tract of country,lower-lying and thickly wooded, which belonged neither to the Fascistsnor ourselves."
12958,6,Both we and they used to make daylight patrols there.
12959,6,"Itwas not bad fun in a Boy Scoutish way, though I never saw a Fascistpatrol nearer than several hundred yards."
12960,6,"By a lot of crawling on yourbelly you could work your way partly through the Fascist lines and couldeven see the farm-house flying the monarchist flag, which was the localFascist headquarters."
12961,6,Occasionally we gave it a rifle-volley and thenslipped into cover before the machine-guns could locate us.
12962,6,"I hope webroke a few windows, but it was a good eight hundred metres away, andwith our rifles you could not make sure of hitting even a house at thatrange.The weather was mostly clear and cold; sometimes sunny at midday, butalways cold."
12963,6,"Here and there in the soil of the hill-sides you found thegreen beaks of wild crocuses or irises poking through; evidently springwas coming, but coming very slowly."
12964,6,The nights were colder than ever.Coming off guard in the small hours we used to rake together what wasleft of the cook-house fire and then stand in the red-hot embers.
12965,6,"It wasbad for your boots, but it was very good for your feet."
12966,6,But there weremornings when the sight of the dawn among the mountain-tops made italmost worth while to be out of bed at godless hours.
12967,6,"I hate mountains,even from a spectacular point of view."
12968,6,"But sometimes the dawn breakingbehind the hill-tops in our rear, the first narrow streaks of gold, likeswords slitting the darkness, and then the growing light and the seas ofcarmine cloud stretching away into inconceivable distances, were worthwatching even when you had been up all night, when your legs were numbfrom the knees down, and you were sullenly reflecting that there was nohope of food for another three hours."
12969,6,"I saw the dawn oftener during thiscampaign than during the rest of my life put together--or during thepart that is to come, I hope.We were short-handed here, which meant longer guards and more fatigues.I was beginning to suffer a little from the lack of sleep which isinevitable even in the quietest kind of war."
12970,6,"Apart from guard-duties andpatrols there were constant night-alarms and stand-to's, and in any caseyou can't sleep properly in a beastly hole in the ground with your feetaching with the cold."
12971,6,In my first three or four months in the line I donot suppose I had more than a dozen periods of twenty-four hours thatwere completely without sleep; on the other hand I certainly did nothave a dozen nights of full sleep.
12972,6,Twenty or thirty hours' sleep in aweek was quite a normal amount.
12973,6,"The effects of this were not so bad asmight be expected; one grew very stupid, and the job of climbing up anddown the hills grew harder instead of easier, but one felt well and onewas constantly hungry--heavens, how hungry! All food seemed good, eventhe eternal haricot beans which everyone in Spain finally learned tohate the sight of."
12974,6,"Our water, what there was of it, came from milesaway, on the backs of mules or little persecuted donkeys."
12975,6,For somereason the Arag󮠰easants treated their mules well but their donkeysabominably.
12976,6,If a donkey refused to go it was quite usual to kick him inthe testicles.
12977,6,"The issue of candles had ceased, and matches were runningshort."
12978,6,"The Spaniards taught us how to make olive oil lamps out of acondensed milk tin, a cartridge-clip, and a bit of rag."
12979,6,"When you had anyolive oil, which was not often, these things would burn with a smokyflicker, about a quarter candle power, just enough to find your rifleby.There seemed no hope of any real fighting."
12980,6,When we left Monte Pocero Ihad counted my cartridges and found that in nearly three weeks I hadfired just three shots at the enemy.
12981,6,"They say it takes a thousandbullets to kill a man, and at this rate it would be twenty years beforeI killed my first Fascist."
12982,6,"At Monte Oscuro the lines were closer and onefired oftener, but I am reasonably certain that I never hit anyone."
12983,6,"As amatter of fact, on this front and at this period of the war the realweapon was not the rifle but the megaphone."
12984,6,Being unable to kill yourenemy you shouted at him instead.
12985,6,This method of warfare is soextraordinary that it needs explaining.Wherever the lines were within hailing distance of .
12986,6,"It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape thevile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions,though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from enteringalong with him.The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats."
12987,6,"At one end of it acoloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall.It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of aman of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsomefeatures."
12988,6,Winston made for the stairs.
12989,6,It was no use trying the lift.
12990,6,"Evenat the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electriccurrent was cut off during daylight hours."
12991,6,It was part of the economy drivein preparation for Hate Week.
12992,6,"The flat was seven flights up, and Winston,who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, wentslowly, resting several times on the way."
12993,6,"On each landing, opposite thelift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall."
12994,6,It wasone of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you aboutwhen you move.
12995,6,"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which hadsomething to do with the production of pig-iron."
12996,6,The voice came from anoblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surfaceof the right-hand wall.
12997,6,"Winston turned a switch and the voice sanksomewhat, though the words were still distinguishable."
12998,6,"The instrument(the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way ofshutting it off completely."
12999,6,"He moved over to the window: a smallish, frailfigure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overallswhich were the uniform of the party."
13000,6,"His hair was very fair, his facenaturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razorblades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold."
13001,6,"Down inthe street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper intospirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, thereseemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plasteredeverywhere."
13002,6,The black-moustachio'd face gazed down from every commandingcorner.
13003,6,There was one on the house-front immediately opposite.
13004,6,"BIG BROTHERIS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep intoWinston's own."
13005,6,"Down at street level another poster, torn at one corner,flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering thesingle word INGSOC."
13006,6,"In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down betweenthe roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away againwith a curving flight."
13007,6,"It was the police patrol, snooping into people'swindows."
13008,6,"The patrols did not matter, however."
13009,6,Only the Thought Policemattered.Behind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling awayabout pig-iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan.
13010,6,Thetelescreen received and transmitted simultaneously.
13011,6,"Any sound that Winstonmade, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it,moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metalplaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard."
13012,6,There was of courseno way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment.
13013,6,"Howoften, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individualwire was guesswork."
13014,6,It was even conceivable that they watched everybody allthe time.
13015,6,But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wantedto.
13016,6,"You had to live--did live, from habit that became instinct--in theassumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except indarkness, every movement scrutinized.Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen."
13017,6,"It was safer; though, as hewell knew, even a back can be revealing."
13018,6,"A kilometre away the Ministry ofTruth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy landscape.This, he thought with a sort of vague distaste--this was London, chiefcity of Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the provinces ofOceania."
13019,6,He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell himwhether London had always been quite like this.
13020,6,"Were there always thesevistas of rotting nineteenth-century houses, their sides shored up withbaulks of timber, their windows patched with cardboard and their roofswith corrugated iron, their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions?And the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and thewillow-herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the places where thebombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid coloniesof wooden dwellings like chicken-houses? But it was no use, he could notremember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright-littableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible.The Ministry of Truth--Minitrue, in Newspeak [Newspeak was the officiallanguage of Oceania."
13021,6,For an account of its structure and etymology seeAppendix.]--was startlingly different from any other object in sight.
13022,6,"Itwas an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaringup, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into the air."
13023,6,"From where Winstonstood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white face inelegant lettering, the three slogans of the Party:  WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTHThe Ministry of Truth contained, it was said, three thousand rooms aboveground level, and corresponding ramifications below."
13024,6,Scattered about Londonthere were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size.
13025,6,Socompletely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roofof Victory Mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously.
13026,6,Theywere the homes of the four Ministries between which the entire apparatusof government was divided.
13027,6,"The Ministry of Truth, which concerned itselfwith news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts."
13028,6,"The Ministry ofPeace, which concerned itself with war."
13029,6,"The Ministry of Love, whichmaintained law and order."
13030,6,"And the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsiblefor economic affairs."
13031,6,"Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv,and Miniplenty.The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one."
13032,6,There were no windowsin it at all.
13033,6,"Winston had never been inside the Ministry of Love, norwithin half a kilometre of it."
13034,6,"It was a place impossible to enter excepton official business, and then only by penetrating through a maze ofbarbed-wire entanglements, steel doors, and hidden machine-gun nests."
13035,6,"Eventhe streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla-facedguards in black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons.Winston turned round abruptly."
13036,6,He had set his features into theexpression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facingthe telescreen.
13037,6,He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen.
13038,6,"By leavingthe Ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in thecanteen, and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen excepta hunk of dark-coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow'sbreakfast."
13039,6,He took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquidwith a plain white label marked VICTORY GIN.
13040,6,"It gave off a sickly, oilysmell, as of Chinese rice-spirit."
13041,6,"Winston poured out nearly a teacupful,nerved himself for a shock, and gulped it down like a dose of medicine.Instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes."
13042,6,"Thestuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had thesensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club."
13043,6,"Thenext moment, however, the burning in his belly died down and the worldbegan to look more cheerful."
13044,6,"He took a cigarette from a crumpled packetmarked VICTORY CIGARETTES and incautiously held it upright, whereupon thetobacco fell out on to the floor."
13045,6,With the next he was more successful.He went back to the living-room and sat down at a small table that stoodto the left of the telescreen.
13046,6,"From the table drawer he took out apenholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto-sized blank book with ared back and a marbled cover.For some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusualposition."
13047,6,"Instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall, whereit could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite thewindow."
13048,6,"To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winstonwas now sitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably beenintended to hold bookshelves."
13049,6,"By sitting in the alcove, and keeping wellback, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, sofar as sight went."
13050,6,"He could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayedin his present position he could not be seen."
13051,6,It was partly the unusualgeography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was nowabout to do.But it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out ofthe drawer.
13052,6,It was a peculiarly beautiful book.
13053,6,"Its smooth creamy paper,a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured forat least forty years past."
13054,6,"He could guess, however, that the book was mucholder than that."
13055,6,He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy littlejunk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what quarter he did notnow remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desireto possess it.
13056,6,"Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops('dealing on the free market', it was called), but the rule was notstrictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces andrazor blades, which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way."
13057,6,Hehad given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped insideand bought the book for two dollars fifty.
13058,6,At the time he was not consciousof wanting it for any particular purpose.
13059,6,He had carried it guiltily homein his briefcase.
13060,6,"Even with nothing written in it, it was a compromisingpossession.The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary."
13061,6,"This was not illegal(nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detectedit was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at leastby twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp."
13062,6,Winston fitted a nib intothe penholder and sucked it to get the grease off.
13063,6,"The pen was an archaicinstrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured one,furtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that thebeautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib insteadof being scratched with an ink-pencil."
13064,6,Actually he was not used to writingby hand.
13065,6,"Apart from very short notes, it was usual to dictate everythinginto the speak-write which was of course impossible for his presentpurpose."
13066,6,He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just asecond.
13067,6,A tremor had gone through his bowels.
13068,6,To mark the paper was thedecisive act.
13069,6,"In small clumsy letters he wrote:   April 4th, 1984.He sat back."
13070,6,A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him.
13071,6,"Tobegin with, he did not know with any certainty that this was 1984."
13072,6,"Itmust be round about that date, since he was fairly sure that his age wasthirty-nine, and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; butit was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two.For whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he writing this diary?For the future, for the unborn."
13073,6,"His mind hovered for a moment round thedoubtful date on the page, and then fetched up with a bump against theNewspeak word DOUBLETHINK."
13074,6,For the first time the magnitude of what he hadundertaken came home to him.
13075,6,How could you communicate with the future? Itwas of its nature impossible.
13076,6,"Either the future would resemble the present,in which case it would not listen to him: or it would be different from it,and his predicament would be meaningless.For some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper."
13077,6,The telescreen hadchanged over to strident military music.
13078,6,"It was curious that he seemednot merely to have lost the power of expressing himself, but even to haveforgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say."
13079,6,"For weekspast he had been making ready for this moment, and it had never crossedhis mind that anything would be needed except courage."
13080,6,The actual writingwould be easy.
13081,6,"All he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminablerestless monologue that had been running inside his head, literally foryears."
13082,6,"At this moment, however, even the monologue had dried up."
13083,6,Moreoverhis varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably.
13084,6,"He dared not scratch it,because if he did so it always became inflamed."
13085,6,The seconds were tickingby.
13086,6,"He was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in frontof him, the itching of the skin above his ankle, the blaring of the music,and a slight booziness caused by the gin.Suddenly he began writing in sheer panic, only imperfectly aware of whathe was setting down."
13087,6,"His small but childish handwriting straggled up anddown the page, shedding first its capital letters and finally even itsfull stops:   April 4th, 1984."
13088,6,Last night to the flicks.
13089,6,All war films.
13090,6,"One very goodone of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the Mediterranean.Audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim awaywith a helicopter after him, first you saw him wallowing along in thewater like a porpoise, then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights,then he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink and he sank assuddenly as though the holes had let in the water, audience shouting withlaughter when he sank."
13091,6,then you saw a lifeboat full of children with ahelicopter hovering over it.
13092,6,there was a middle-aged woman might have beena jewess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old inher arms.
13093,6,"little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between herbreasts as if he was trying to burrow right into her and the woman puttingher arms round him and comforting him although she was blue with frightherself, all the time covering him up as much as possible as if she thoughther arms could keep the bullets off him."
13094,6,"then the helicopter planted a 20kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwood.then there was a wonderful shot of a child's arm going up up up right upinto the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed itup and there was a lot of applause from the party seats but a woman down inthe prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shoutingthey didnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it aintright not in front of kids it aint until the police turned her turned herout i dont suppose anything happened to her nobody cares what the prolessay typical prole reaction they never----Winston stopped writing, partly because he was suffering from cramp."
13095,6,He didnot know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish.
13096,6,"But the curiousthing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory hadclarified itself in his mind, to the point where he almost felt equal towriting it down."
13097,6,"It was, he now realized, because of this other incidentthat he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today.It had happened that morning at the Ministry, if anything so nebulous couldbe said to happen.It was nearly eleven hundred, and in the Records Department, where Winstonworked, they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and grouping themin the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen, in preparation forthe Two Minutes Hate."
13098,6,"Winston was just taking his place in one of themiddle rows when two people whom he knew by sight, but had never spokento, came unexpectedly into the room."
13099,6,One of them was a girl whom he oftenpassed in the corridors.
13100,6,"He did not know her name, but he knew that sheworked in the Fiction Department."
13101,6,Presumably--since he had sometimes seenher with oily hands and carrying a spanner--she had some mechanical jobon one of the novel-writing machines.
13102,6,"She was a bold-looking girl, ofabout twenty-seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift, athleticmovements."
13103,6,"A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, waswound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough tobring out the shapeliness of her hips."
13104,6,Winston had disliked her from thevery first moment of seeing her.
13105,6,He knew the reason.
13106,6,It was because of theatmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community hikes and generalclean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her.
13107,6,"He dislikednearly all women, and especially the young and pretty ones."
13108,6,"It was alwaysthe women, and above all the young ones, who were the most bigotedadherents of the Party, the swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies andnosers-out of unorthodoxy."
13109,6,But this particular girl gave him the impressionof being more dangerous than most.
13110,6,Once when they passed in the corridorshe gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right intohim and for a moment had filled him with black terror.
13111,6,The idea had evencrossed his mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police.
13112,6,"That,it was true, was very unlikely."
13113,6,"Still, he continued to feel a peculiaruneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenevershe was anywhere near him.The other person was a man named O'Brien, a member of the Inner Party andholder of some post so important and remote that Winston had only a dimidea of its nature."
13114,6,A momentary hush passed over the group of peopleround the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an Inner Party memberapproaching.
13115,6,"O'Brien was a large, burly man with a thick neck and a coarse,humorous, brutal face."
13116,6,In spite of his formidable appearance he had acertain charm of manner.
13117,6,"He had a trick of resettling his spectacles onhis nose which was curiously disarming--in some indefinable way, curiouslycivilized."
13118,6,"It was a gesture which, if anyone had still thought in suchterms, might have recalled an eighteenth-century nobleman offering hissnuffbox."
13119,6,Winston had seen O'Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as manyyears.
13120,6,"He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because he was intriguedby the contrast between O'Brien's urbane manner and his prize-fighter'sphysique."
13121,6,"Much more it was because of a secretly held belief--or perhapsnot even a belief, merely a hope--that O'Brien's political orthodoxy wasnot perfect."
13122,6,Something in his face suggested it irresistibly.
13123,6,"And again,perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face, butsimply intelligence."
13124,6,But at any rate he had the appearance of being aperson that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen andget him alone.
13125,6,"Winston had never made the smallest effort to verify thisguess: indeed, there was no way of doing so."
13126,6,"At this moment O'Brien glancedat his wrist-watch, saw that it was nearly eleven hundred, and evidentlydecided to stay in the Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate wasover."
13127,6,"He took a chair in the same row as Winston, a couple of places away.A small, sandy-haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to Winston wasbetween them."
13128,6,"The girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind.The next moment a hideous, grinding screech, as of some monstrous machinerunning without oil, burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room.It was a noise that set one's teeth on edge and bristled the hair at theback of one's neck."
13129,6,"The Hate had started.As usual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of the People, hadflashed on to the screen."
13130,6,There were hisses here and there among theaudience.
13131,6,The little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear anddisgust.
13132,6,"Goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago(how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leadingfigures of the Party, almost on a level with Big Brother himself, andthen had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had been condemnedto death, and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared."
13133,6,"The programmesof the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day, but there was none inwhich Goldstein was not the principal figure."
13134,6,"He was the primal traitor,the earliest defiler of the Party's purity."
13135,6,"All subsequent crimes againstthe Party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations,sprang directly out of his teaching."
13136,6,"Somewhere or other he was stillalive and hatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea,under the protection of his foreign paymasters, perhaps even--so it wasoccasionally rumoured--in some hiding-place in Oceania itself.Winston's diaphragm was constricted."
13137,6,He could never see the face ofGoldstein without a painful mixture of emotions.
13138,6,"It was a lean Jewish face,with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard--aclever face, and yet somehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senilesilliness in the long thin nose, near the end of which a pair of spectacleswas perched."
13139,6,"It resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, had asheep-like quality."
13140,6,"Goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attackupon the doctrines of the Party--an attack so exaggerated and perverse thata child should have been able to see through it, and yet just plausibleenough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people, lesslevel-headed than oneself, might be taken in by it."
13141,6,"He was abusing BigBrother, he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party, he was demandingthe immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he was advocating freedomof speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought,he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed--and allthis in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of thehabitual style of the orators of the Party, and even contained Newspeakwords: more Newspeak words, indeed, than any Party member would normallyuse in real life."
13142,6,"And all the while, lest one should be in any doubt as tothe reality which Goldstein's specious claptrap covered, behind his head onthe telescreen there marched the endless columns of the Eurasian army--rowafter row of solid-looking men with expressionless Asiatic faces, who swamup to the surface of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by othersexactly similar."
13143,6,"The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers' boots formed thebackground to Goldstein's bleating voice.Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncontrollableexclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room.The self-satisfied sheep-like face on the screen, and the terrifying powerof the Eurasian army behind it, were too much to be borne: besides,the sight or even the thought of Goldstein produced fear and angerautomatically."
13144,6,"He was an object of hatred more constant than either Eurasiaor Eastasia, since when Oceania was at war with one of these Powers it wasgenerally at peace with the other."
13145,6,"But what was strange was that althoughGoldstein was hated and despised by everybody, although every day and athousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers,in books, his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to thegeneral gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were--in spite of all this,his influence never seemed to grow less."
13146,6,Always there were fresh dupeswaiting to be seduced by him.
13147,6,"A day never passed when spies and saboteursacting under his directions were not unmasked by the Thought Police.He was the commander of a vast shadowy army, an underground network ofconspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the State."
13148,6,"The Brotherhood, itsname was supposed to be."
13149,6,"There were also whispered stories of a terriblebook, a compendium of all the heresies, of which Goldstein was the authorand which circulated clandestinely here and there."
13150,6,It was a book without atitle.
13151,6,"People referred to it, if at all, simply as THE BOOK."
13152,6,But one knewof such things only through vague rumours.
13153,6,Neither the Brotherhood norTHE BOOK was a subject that any ordinary Party member would mention ifthere was a way of avoiding it.In its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy.
13154,6,People were leaping up anddown in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effortto drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen.
13155,6,"The littlesandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening andshutting like that of a landed fish."
13156,6,"Even O'Brien's heavy face was flushed.He was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling andquivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave."
13157,6,Thedark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out 'Swine! Swine! Swine!'and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at thescreen.
13158,6,It struck Goldstein's nose and bounced off; the voice continuedinexorably.
13159,6,In a lucid moment Winston found that he was shouting with theothers and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair.
13160,6,"Thehorrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged toact a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joiningin."
13161,6,Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary.
13162,6,"A hideousecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smashfaces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group ofpeople like an electric current, turning one even against one's will intoa grimacing, screaming lunatic."
13163,6,"And yet the rage that one felt was anabstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object toanother like the flame of a blowlamp."
13164,6,"Thus, at one moment Winston's hatredwas not turned against Goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, againstBig Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at such moments hisheart went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardianof truth and sanity in a world of lies."
13165,6,"And yet the very next instant hewas at one with the people about him, and all that was said of Goldsteinseemed to him to be true."
13166,6,"At those moments his secret loathing of BigBrother changed into adoration, and Big Brother seemed to tower up, aninvincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock against the hordesof Asia, and Goldstein, in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, andthe doubt that hung about his very existence, seemed like some sinisterenchanter, capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structureof civilization.It was even possible, at moments, to switch one's hatred this way or thatby a voluntary act."
13167,6,"Suddenly, by the sort of violent effort with which onewrenches one's head away from the pillow in a nightmare, Winston succeededin transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark-hairedgirl behind him."
13168,6,"Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind.He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon."
13169,6,He would tie her nakedto a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian.
13170,6,He wouldravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax.
13171,6,"Better than before,moreover, he realized WHY it was that he hated her."
13172,6,"He hated her becauseshe was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed withher and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, whichseemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odiousscarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.The Hate rose to its climax."
13173,6,"The voice of Goldstein had become an actualsheep's bleat, and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep.Then the sheep-face melted into the figure of a Eurasian soldier who seemedto be advancing, huge and terrible, his sub-machine gun roaring, andseeming to spring out of the surface of the screen, so that some of thepeople in the front row actually flinched backwards in their seats."
13174,6,"Butin the same moment, drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, thehostile figure melted into the face of Big Brother, black-haired,black-moustachio'd, full of power and mysterious calm, and so vast thatit almost filled up the screen."
13175,6,"Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying.It was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words that areuttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable individually butrestoring confidence by the fact of being spoken."
13176,6,"Then the face of BigBrother faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the Party stoodout in bold capitals:  WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTHBut the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for several seconds on thescreen, as though the impact that it had made on everyone's eyeballs wastoo vivid to wear off immediately."
13177,6,The little sandy-haired woman had flungherself forward over the back of the chair in front of her.
13178,6,With atremulous murmur that sounded like 'My Saviour!' she extended her armstowards the screen.
13179,6,Then she buried her face in her hands.
13180,6,"It was apparentthat she was uttering a prayer.At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow,rhythmical chant of 'B-B!...B-B!'--over and over again, very slowly, with along pause between the first 'B' and the second--a heavy, murmurous sound,somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear thestamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms."
13181,6,For perhaps as much asthirty seconds they kept it up.
13182,6,It was a refrain that was often heard inmoments of overwhelming emotion.
13183,6,"Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdomand majesty of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis,a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise.Winston's entrails seemed to grow cold."
13184,6,"In the Two Minutes Hate he couldnot help sharing in the general delirium, but this sub-human chanting of'B-B!...B-B!' always filled him with horror."
13185,6,Of course he chanted with therest: it was impossible to do otherwise.
13186,6,"To dissemble your feelings, tocontrol your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctivereaction."
13187,6,But there was a space of a couple of seconds during which theexpression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him.
13188,6,"And it wasexactly at this moment that the significant thing happened--if, indeed,it did happen.Momentarily he caught O'Brien's eye."
13189,6,O'Brien had stood up.
13190,6,He had takenoff his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose withhis characteristic gesture.
13191,6,"But there was a fraction of a second whentheir eyes met, and for as long as it took to happen Winston knew--yes, heKNEW!--that O'Brien was thinking the same thing as himself."
13192,6,An unmistakablemessage had passed.
13193,6,It was as though their two minds had opened and thethoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes.
13194,6,"'I amwith you,' O'Brien seemed to be saying to him."
13195,6,'I know precisely what youare feeling.
13196,6,"I know all about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust.But don't worry, I am on your side!' And then the flash of intelligencewas gone, and O'Brien's face was as inscrutable as everybody else's.That was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had happened."
13197,6,Suchincidents never had any sequel.
13198,6,"All that they did was to keep alive in himthe belief, or hope, that others besides himself were the enemies of theParty."
13199,6,"Perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true afterall--perhaps the Brotherhood really existed! It was impossible, in spiteof the endless arrests and confessions and executions, to be sure that theBrotherhood was not simply a myth."
13200,6,"Some days he believed in it, some daysnot."
13201,6,"There was no evidence, only fleeting glimpses that might mean anythingor nothing: snatches of overheard conversation, faint scribbles on lavatorywalls--once, even, when two strangers met, a small movement of the handwhich had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition."
13202,6,It was allguesswork: very likely he had imagined everything.
13203,6,He had gone back to hiscubicle without looking at O'Brien again.
13204,6,The idea of following up theirmomentary contact hardly crossed his mind.
13205,6,It would have been inconceivablydangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it.
13206,6,"For a second, twoseconds, they had exchanged an equivocal glance, and that was the end ofthe story."
13207,6,"But even that was a memorable event, in the locked loneliness inwhich one had to live.Winston roused himself and sat up straighter."
13208,6,He let out a belch.
13209,6,The ginwas rising from his stomach.His eyes re-focused on the page.
13210,6,"He discovered that while he sat helplesslymusing he had also been writing, as though by automatic action."
13211,6,"And it wasno longer the same cramped, awkward handwriting as before."
13212,6,"His pen had slidvoluptuously over the smooth paper, printing in large neat capitals--  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHERover and over again, filling half a page.He could not help feeling a twinge of panic."
13213,6,"It was absurd, since thewriting of those particular words was not more dangerous than the initialact of opening the diary, but for a moment he was tempted to tear out thespoiled pages and abandon the enterprise altogether.He did not do so, however, because he knew that it was useless."
13214,6,"Whether hewrote DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER, or whether he refrained from writing it, madeno difference."
13215,6,"Whether he went on with the diary, or whether he did not goon with it, made no difference."
13216,6,The Thought Police would get him just thesame.
13217,6,"He had committed--would still have committed, even if he had neverset pen to paper--the essential crime that contained all others in itself.Thoughtcrime, they called it."
13218,6,Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could beconcealed for ever.
13219,6,"You might dodge successfully for a while, even foryears, but sooner or later they were bound to get you.It was always at night--the arrests invariably happened at night."
13220,6,"Thesudden jerk out of sleep, the rough hand shaking your shoulder, the lightsglaring in your eyes, the ring of hard faces round the bed."
13221,6,"In the vastmajority of cases there was no trial, no report of the arrest."
13222,6,"Peoplesimply disappeared, always during the night."
13223,6,"Your name was removed from theregisters, every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out, yourone-time existence was denied and then forgotten."
13224,6,"You were abolished,annihilated: VAPORIZED was the usual word.For a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria."
13225,6,"He began writing in ahurried untidy scrawl:   theyll shoot me i don't care theyll shoot me in the back of the neck idont care down with big brother they always shoot you in the back of theneck i dont care down with big brother----He sat back in his chair, slightly ashamed of himself, and laid downthe pen."
13226,6,The next moment he started violently.
13227,6,"There was a knocking atthe door.Already! He sat as still as a mouse, in the futile hope that whoever it wasmight go away after a single attempt."
13228,6,"But no, the knocking was repeated.The worst thing of all would be to delay."
13229,6,"His heart was thumping like adrum, but his face, from long habit, was probably expressionless."
13230,6,He gotup and moved heavily towards the door.Chapter 2As he put his hand to the door-knob Winston saw that he had left thediary open on the table.
13231,6,"DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER was written all over it,in letters almost big enough to be legible across the room."
13232,6,It was aninconceivably stupid thing to have done.
13233,6,"But, he realized, even in hispanic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper by shutting the bookwhile the ink was wet.He drew in his breath and opened the door."
13234,6,Instantly a warm wave of reliefflowed through him.
13235,6,"A colourless, crushed-looking woman, with wispy hairand a lined face, was standing outside.'Oh, comrade,' she began in a dreary, whining sort of voice, 'I thought Iheard you come in."
13236,6,"Do you think you could come across and have a look atour kitchen sink? It's got blocked up and----'It was Mrs Parsons, the wife of a neighbour on the same floor."
13237,6,"('Mrs' wasa word somewhat discountenanced by the Party--you were supposed to calleveryone 'comrade'--but with some women one used it instinctively.) She wasa woman of about thirty, but looking much older."
13238,6,One had the impressionthat there was dust in the creases of her face.
13239,6,Winston followed her downthe passage.
13240,6,"These amateur repair jobs were an almost daily irritation.Victory Mansions were old flats, built in 1930 or thereabouts, and werefalling to pieces."
13241,6,"The plaster flaked constantly from ceilings and walls,the pipes burst in every hard frost, the roof leaked whenever there wassnow, the heating system was usually running at half steam when it was notclosed down altogether from motives of economy."
13242,6,"Repairs, except what youcould do for yourself, had to be sanctioned by remote committees whichwere liable to hold up even the mending of a window-pane for two years.'Of course it's only because Tom isn't home,' said Mrs Parsons vaguely.The Parsons' flat was bigger than Winston's, and dingy in a differentway."
13243,6,"Everything had a battered, trampled-on look, as though theplace had just been visited by some large violent animal."
13244,6,"Gamesimpedimenta--hockey-sticks, boxing-gloves, a burst football, a pair ofsweaty shorts turned inside out--lay all over the floor, and on thetable there was a litter of dirty dishes and dog-eared exercise-books.On the walls were scarlet banners of the Youth League and the Spies, anda full-sized poster of Big Brother."
13245,6,"There was the usual boiled-cabbagesmell, common to the whole building, but it was shot through by a sharperreek of sweat, which--one knew this at the first sniff, though it washard to say how--was the sweat of some person not present at the moment.In another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper wastrying to keep tune with the military music which was still issuingfrom the telescreen.'It's the children,' said Mrs Parsons, casting a half-apprehensive glanceat the door."
13246,6,'They haven't been out today.
13247,6,And of course----'She had a habit of breaking off her sentences in the middle.
13248,6,The kitchensink was full nearly to the brim with filthy greenish water which smeltworse than ever of cabbage.
13249,6,Winston knelt down and examined the angle-jointof the pipe.
13250,6,"He hated using his hands, and he hated bending down, which wasalways liable to start him coughing."
13251,6,"Mrs Parsons looked on helplessly.'Of course if Tom was home he'd put it right in a moment,' she said.'He loves anything like that."
13252,6,"He's ever so good with his hands, Tom is.'Parsons was Winston's fellow-employee at the Ministry of Truth."
13253,6,"He wasa fattish but active man of paralysing stupidity, a mass of imbecileenthusiasms--one of those completely unquestioning, devoted drudges onwhom, more even than on the Thought Police, the stability of the Partydepended."
13254,6,"At thirty-five he had just been unwillingly evicted from theYouth League, and before graduating into the Youth League he had managed tostay on in the Spies for a year beyond the statutory age."
13255,6,"At the Ministryhe was employed in some subordinate post for which intelligence was notrequired, but on the other hand he was a leading figure on the SportsCommittee and all the other committees engaged in organizing communityhikes, spontaneous demonstrations, savings campaigns, and voluntaryactivities generally."
13256,6,"He would inform you with quiet pride, between whiffsof his pipe, that he had put in an appearance at the Community Centre everyevening for the past four years."
13257,6,"An overpowering smell of sweat, a sort ofunconscious testimony to the strenuousness of his life, followed him aboutwherever he went, and even remained behind him after he had gone.'Have you got a spanner?' said Winston, fiddling with the nut on theangle-joint.'A spanner,' said Mrs Parsons, immediately becoming invertebrate."
13258,6,"'I don'tknow, I'm sure."
13259,6,Perhaps the children----'There was a trampling of boots and another blast on the comb as thechildren charged into the living-room.
13260,6,Mrs Parsons brought the spanner.Winston let out the water and disgustedly removed the clot of human hairthat had blocked up the pipe.
13261,6,"He cleaned his fingers as best he could inthe cold water from the tap and went back into the other room.'Up with your hands!' yelled a savage voice.A handsome, tough-looking boy of nine had popped up from behind the tableand was menacing him with a toy automatic pistol, while his small sister,about two years younger, made the same gesture with a fragment of wood.Both of them were dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirts, and redneckerchiefs which were the uniform of the Spies."
13262,6,"Winston raised his handsabove his head, but with an uneasy feeling, so vicious was the boy'sdemeanour, that it was not altogether a game.'You're a traitor!' yelled the boy."
13263,6,"'You're a thought-criminal! You're aEurasian spy! I'll shoot you, I'll vaporize you, I'll send you to the saltmines!'Suddenly they were both leaping round him, shouting 'Traitor!' and'Thought-criminal!' the little girl imitating her brother in everymovement."
13264,6,"It was somehow slightly frightening, like the gambolling oftiger cubs which will soon grow up into man-eaters."
13265,6,"There was a sort ofcalculating ferocity in the boy's eye, a quite evident desire to hit orkick Winston and a consciousness of being very nearly big enough to do so.It was a good job it was not a real pistol he was holding, Winston thought.Mrs Parsons' eyes flitted nervously from Winston to the children, and backagain."
13266,6,"In the better light of the living-room he noticed with interestthat there actually was dust in the creases of her face.'They do get so noisy,' she said."
13267,6,"'They're disappointed because theycouldn't go to see the hanging, that's what it is."
13268,6,I'm too busy to takethem.
13269,6,"and Tom won't be back from work in time.''Why can't we go and see the hanging?' roared the boy in his huge voice.'Want to see the hanging! Want to see the hanging!' chanted the littlegirl, still capering round.Some Eurasian prisoners, guilty of war crimes, were to be hanged in thePark that evening, Winston remembered."
13270,6,"This happened about once a month,and was a popular spectacle."
13271,6,Children always clamoured to be taken to seeit.
13272,6,He took his leave of Mrs Parsons and made for the door.
13273,6,But he had notgone six steps down the passage when something hit the back of his neck anagonizingly painful blow.
13274,6,It was as though a red-hot wire had been jabbedinto him.
13275,6,He spun round just in time to see Mrs Parsons dragging her sonback into the doorway while the boy pocketed a catapult.'Goldstein!' bellowed the boy as the door closed on him.
13276,6,"But what moststruck Winston was the look of helpless fright on the woman's greyish face.Back in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreen and sat down at thetable again, still rubbing his neck."
13277,6,The music from the telescreen hadstopped.
13278,6,"Instead, a clipped military voice was reading out, with a sort ofbrutal relish, a description of the armaments of the new Floating Fortresswhich had just been anchored between Iceland and the Faroe Islands.With those children, he thought, that wretched woman must lead a life ofterror."
13279,6,"Another year, two years, and they would be watching her nightand day for symptoms of unorthodoxy."
13280,6,Nearly all children nowadays werehorrible.
13281,6,"What was worst of all was that by means of such organizations asthe Spies they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savages,and yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against thediscipline of the Party."
13282,6,"On the contrary, they adored the Party andeverything connected with it."
13283,6,"The songs, the processions, the banners, thehiking, the drilling with dummy rifles, the yelling of slogans, the worshipof Big Brother--it was all a sort of glorious game to them."
13284,6,"All theirferocity was turned outwards, against the enemies of the State, againstforeigners, traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals."
13285,6,It was almost normalfor people over thirty to be frightened of their own children.
13286,6,"And withgood reason, for hardly a week passed in which 'The Times' did not carrya paragraph describing how some eavesdropping little sneak--'child hero'was the phrase generally used--had overheard some compromising remarkand denounced its parents to the Thought Police.The sting of the catapult bullet had worn off."
13287,6,"He picked up his penhalf-heartedly, wondering whether he could find something more to writein the diary."
13288,6,Suddenly he began thinking of O'Brien again.Years ago--how long was it? Seven years it must be--he had dreamed that hewas walking through a pitch-dark room.
13289,6,"And someone sitting to one side ofhim had said as he passed: 'We shall meet in the place where there is nodarkness.' It was said very quietly, almost casually--a statement, not acommand."
13290,6,He had walked on without pausing.
13291,6,"What was curious was that at thetime, in the dream, the words had not made much impression on him."
13292,6,It wasonly later and by degrees that they had seemed to take on significance.
13293,6,"Hecould not now remember whether it was before or after having the dream thathe had seen O'Brien for the first time, nor could he remember when he hadfirst identified the voice as O'Brien's."
13294,6,But at any rate the identificationexisted.
13295,6,It was O'Brien who had spoken to him out of the dark.Winston had never been able to feel sure--even after this morning's flashof the eyes it was still impossible to be sure whether O'Brien was a friendor an enemy.
13296,6,Nor did it even seem to matter greatly.
13297,6,"There was a link ofunderstanding between them, more important than affection or partisanship.'We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,' he had said.Winston did not know what it meant, only that in some way or another itwould come true.The voice from the telescreen paused."
13298,6,"A trumpet call, clear and beautiful,floated into the stagnant air."
13299,6,"The voice continued raspingly:'Attention! Your attention, please! A newsflash has this moment arrivedfrom the Malabar front."
13300,6,Our forces in South India have won a gloriousvictory.
13301,6,I am authorized to say that the action we are now reporting maywell bring the war within measurable distance of its end.
13302,6,"Here is thenewsflash----'Bad news coming, thought Winston."
13303,6,"And sure enough, following on a gorydescription of the annihilation of a Eurasian army, with stupendous figuresof killed and prisoners, came the announcement that, as from next week,the chocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty.Winston belched again."
13304,6,"The gin was wearing off, leaving a deflated feeling.The telescreen--perhaps to celebrate the victory, perhaps to drown thememory of the lost chocolate--crashed into 'Oceania, 'tis for thee'."
13305,6,Youwere supposed to stand to attention.
13306,6,"However, in his present position hewas invisible.'Oceania, 'tis for thee' gave way to lighter music."
13307,6,"Winston walked over tothe window, keeping his back to the telescreen."
13308,6,The day was still cold andclear.
13309,6,"Somewhere far away a rocket bomb exploded with a dull, reverberatingroar."
13310,6,"About twenty or thirty of them a week were falling on London atpresent.Down in the street the wind flapped the torn poster to and fro, and theword INGSOC fitfully appeared and vanished."
13311,6,Ingsoc.
13312,6,The sacred principlesof Ingsoc.
13313,6,"Newspeak, doublethink, the mutability of the past."
13314,6,"He felt asthough he were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom, lost in amonstrous world where he himself was the monster."
13315,6,He was alone.
13316,6,"The pastwas dead, the future was unimaginable."
13317,6,"What certainty had he that a singlehuman creature now living was on his side? And what way of knowing that thedominion of the Party would not endure FOR EVER? Like an answer, the threeslogans on the white face of the Ministry of Truth came back to him:  WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTHHe took a twenty-five cent piece out of his pocket."
13318,6,"There, too, in tinyclear lettering, the same slogans were inscribed, and on the other face ofthe coin the head of Big Brother."
13319,6,"Even from the coin the eyes pursued you.On coins, on stamps, on the covers of books, on banners, on posters, and onthe wrappings of a cigarette packet--everywhere."
13320,6,Always the eyes watchingyou and the voice enveloping you.
13321,6,"Asleep or awake, working or eating,indoors or out of doors, in the bath or in bed--no escape."
13322,6,"Nothing was yourown except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull.The sun had shifted round, and the myriad windows of the Ministry of Truth,with the light no longer shining on them, looked grim as the loopholes of afortress."
13323,6,His heart quailed before the enormous pyramidal shape.
13324,6,"It was toostrong, it could not be stormed."
13325,6,A thousand rocket bombs would not batterit down.
13326,6,He wondered again for whom he was writing the diary.
13327,6,"For thefuture, for the past--for an age that might be imaginary."
13328,6,And in front ofhim there lay not death but annihilation.
13329,6,The diary would be reduced toashes and himself to vapour.
13330,6,"Only the Thought Police would read what he hadwritten, before they wiped it out of existence and out of memory."
13331,6,"How couldyou make appeal to the future when not a trace of you, not even ananonymous word scribbled on a piece of paper, could physically survive?The telescreen struck fourteen."
13332,6,He must leave in ten minutes.
13333,6,"He had to beback at work by fourteen-thirty.Curiously, the chiming of the hour seemed to have put new heart into him.He was a lonely ghost uttering a truth that nobody would ever hear."
13334,6,"But solong as he uttered it, in some obscure way the continuity was not broken.It was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried onthe human heritage."
13335,6,"He went back to the table, dipped his pen, and wrote:   To the future or to the past, to a time when thought is free, when menare different from one another and do not live alone--to a time when truthexists and what is done cannot be undone:   From the age of uniformity, from the age of solitude, from the age ofBig Brother, from the age of doublethink--greetings!He was already dead, he reflected."
13336,6,"It seemed to him that it was only now,when he had begun to be able to formulate his thoughts, that he had takenthe decisive step."
13337,6,The consequences of every act are included in the actitself.
13338,6,He wrote:   Thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime IS death.Now he had recognized himself as a dead man it became important to stayalive as long as possible.
13339,6,Two fingers of his right hand were inkstained.It was exactly the kind of detail that might betray you.
13340,6,"Some nosing zealotin the Ministry (a woman, probably: someone like the little sandy-hairedwoman or the dark-haired girl from the Fiction Department) might startwondering why he had been writing during the lunch interval, why he hadused an old-fashioned pen, WHAT he had been writing--and then drop a hintin the appropriate quarter."
13341,6,He went to the bathroom and carefully scrubbedthe ink away with the gritty dark-brown soap which rasped your skin likesandpaper and was therefore well adapted for this purpose.He put the diary away in the drawer.
13342,6,"It was quite useless to think ofhiding it, but he could at least make sure whether or not its existence hadbeen discovered."
13343,6,A hair laid across the page-ends was too obvious.
13344,6,"With thetip of his finger he picked up an identifiable grain of whitish dust anddeposited it on the corner of the cover, where it was bound to be shakenoff if the book was moved.Chapter 3Winston was dreaming of his mother.He must, he thought, have been ten or eleven years old when his mother haddisappeared."
13345,6,"She was a tall, statuesque, rather silent woman with slowmovements and magnificent fair hair."
13346,6,"His father he remembered more vaguelyas dark and thin, dressed always in neat dark clothes (Winston rememberedespecially the very thin soles of his father's shoes) and wearingspectacles."
13347,6,"The two of them must evidently have been swallowed up in oneof the first great purges of the fifties.At this moment his mother was sitting in some place deep down beneath him,with his young sister in her arms."
13348,6,"He did not remember his sister at all,except as a tiny, feeble baby, always silent, with large, watchful eyes.Both of them were looking up at him."
13349,6,"They were down in some subterraneanplace--the bottom of a well, for instance, or a very deep grave--but itwas a place which, already far below him, was itself moving downwards.They were in the saloon of a sinking ship, looking up at him through thedarkening water."
13350,6,"There was still air in the saloon, they could still seehim and he them, but all the while they were sinking down, down into thegreen waters which in another moment must hide them from sight for ever.He was out in the light and air while they were being sucked down to death,and they were down there because he was up here."
13351,6,"He knew it and they knewit, and he could see the knowledge in their faces."
13352,6,"There was no reproacheither in their faces or in their hearts, only the knowledge that theymust die in order that he might remain alive, and that this was part ofthe unavoidable order of things.He could not remember what had happened, but he knew in his dream that insome way the lives of his mother and his sister had been sacrificed to hisown."
13353,6,"It was one of those dreams which, while retaining the characteristicdream scenery, are a continuation of one's intellectual life, and in whichone becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and valuableafter one is awake."
13354,6,"The thing that now suddenly struck Winston was that hismother's death, nearly thirty years ago, had been tragic and sorrowful ina way that was no longer possible."
13355,6,"Tragedy, he perceived, belonged to theancient time, to a time when there was still privacy, love, and friendship,and when the members of a family stood by one another without needing toknow the reason."
13356,6,"His mother's memory tore at his heart because she had diedloving him, when he was too young and selfish to love her in return, andbecause somehow, he did not remember how, she had sacrificed herself to aconception of loyalty that was private and unalterable."
13357,6,"Such things, hesaw, could not happen today."
13358,6,"Today there were fear, hatred, and pain, butno dignity of emotion, no deep or complex sorrows."
13359,6,"All this he seemed tosee in the large eyes of his mother and his sister, looking up at himthrough the green water, hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking.Suddenly he was standing on short springy turf, on a summer evening whenthe slanting rays of the sun gilded the ground."
13360,6,The landscape that he waslooking at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully certainwhether or not he had seen it in the real world.
13361,6,In his waking thoughts hecalled it the Golden Country.
13362,6,"It was an old, rabbit-bitten pasture, with afoot-track wandering across it and a molehill here and there."
13363,6,"In the raggedhedge on the opposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees wereswaying very faintly in the breeze, their leaves just stirring in densemasses like women's hair."
13364,6,"Somewhere near at hand, though out of sight,there was a clear, slow-moving stream where dace were swimming in thepools under the willow trees.The girl with dark hair was coming towards them across the field."
13365,6,Withwhat seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung themdisdainfully aside.
13366,6,"Her body was white and smooth, but it aroused no desirein him, indeed he barely looked at it."
13367,6,"What overwhelmed him in that instantwas admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside.With its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culture,a whole system of thought, as though Big Brother and the Party and theThought Police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendidmovement of the arm."
13368,6,That too was a gesture belonging to the ancient time.Winston woke up with the word 'Shakespeare' on his lips.The telescreen was giving forth an ear-splitting whistle which continued onthe same note for thirty seconds.
13369,6,"It was nought seven fifteen, getting-uptime for office workers."
13370,6,"Winston wrenched his body out of bed--naked, fora member of the Outer Party received only 3,000 clothing coupons annually,and a suit of pyjamas was 600--and seized a dingy singlet and a pair ofshorts that were lying across a chair."
13371,6,The Physical Jerks would begin inthree minutes.
13372,6,The next moment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fitwhich nearly always attacked him soon after waking up.
13373,6,It emptied his lungsso completely that he could only begin breathing again by lying on his backand taking a series of deep gasps.
13374,6,"His veins had swelled with the effort ofthe cough, and the varicose ulcer had started itching.'Thirty to forty group!' yapped a piercing female voice."
13375,6,"'Thirty to fortygroup! Take your places, please."
13376,6,"Thirties to forties!'Winston sprang to attention in front of the telescreen, upon which theimage of a youngish woman, scrawny but muscular, dressed in tunic andgym-shoes, had already appeared.'Arms bending and stretching!' she rapped out."
13377,6,'Take your time by me.
13378,6,"ONE,two, three, four! ONE, two, three, four! Come on, comrades, put a bit oflife into it! ONE, two, three four! ONE two, three, four!...'The pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out of Winston's mind theimpression made by his dream, and the rhythmic movements of the exerciserestored it somewhat."
13379,6,"As he mechanically shot his arms back and forth,wearing on his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered properduring the Physical Jerks, he was struggling to think his way backward intothe dim period of his early childhood."
13380,6,It was extraordinarily difficult.Beyond the late fifties everything faded.
13381,6,"When there were no externalrecords that you could refer to, even the outline of your own life lostits sharpness."
13382,6,"You remembered huge events which had quite probably nothappened, you remembered the detail of incidents without being able torecapture their atmosphere, and there were long blank periods to which youcould assign nothing."
13383,6,Everything had been different then.
13384,6,"Even the names ofcountries, and their shapes on the map, had been different."
13385,6,"Airstrip One,for instance, had not been so called in those days: it had been calledEngland or Britain, though London, he felt fairly certain, had always beencalled London.Winston could not definitely remember a time when his country had not beenat war, but it was evident that there had been a fairly long interval ofpeace during his childhood, because one of his early memories was of an airraid which appeared to take everyone by surprise."
13386,6,Perhaps it was the timewhen the atomic bomb had fallen on Colchester.
13387,6,"He did not remember the raiditself, but he did remember his father's hand clutching his own as theyhurried down, down, down into some place deep in the earth, round and rounda spiral staircase which rang under his feet and which finally so weariedhis legs that he began whimpering and they had to stop and rest."
13388,6,"Hismother, in her slow, dreamy way, was following a long way behind them."
13389,6,Shewas carrying his baby sister--or perhaps it was only a bundle of blanketsthat she was carrying: he was not certain whether his sister had been bornthen.
13390,6,"Finally they had emerged into a noisy, crowded place which he hadrealized to be a Tube station.There were people sitting all over the stone-flagged floor, and otherpeople, packed tightly together, were sitting on metal bunks, one abovethe other."
13391,6,"Winston and his mother and father found themselves a place onthe floor, and near them an old man and an old woman were sitting side byside on a bunk."
13392,6,The old man had on a decent dark suit and a black cloth cappushed back from very white hair: his face was scarlet and his eyes wereblue and full of tears.
13393,6,He reeked of gin.
13394,6,"It seemed to breathe out of hisskin in place of sweat, and one could have fancied that the tears wellingfrom his eyes were pure gin."
13395,6,But though slightly drunk he was alsosuffering under some grief that was genuine and unbearable.
13396,6,"In his childishway Winston grasped that some terrible thing, something that was beyondforgiveness and could never be remedied, had just happened."
13397,6,It also seemedto him that he knew what it was.
13398,6,"Someone whom the old man loved--a littlegranddaughter, perhaps--had been killed."
13399,6,Every few minutes the old man keptrepeating:'We didn't ought to 'ave trusted 'em.
13400,6,"I said so, Ma, didn't I? That's whatcomes of trusting 'em."
13401,6,I said so all along.
13402,6,"We didn't ought to 'ave trustedthe buggers.'But which buggers they didn't ought to have trusted Winston could not nowremember.Since about that time, war had been literally continuous, though strictlyspeaking it had not always been the same war."
13403,6,"For several months during hischildhood there had been confused street fighting in London itself, someof which he remembered vividly."
13404,6,"But to trace out the history of the wholeperiod, to say who was fighting whom at any given moment, would have beenutterly impossible, since no written record, and no spoken word, ever mademention of any other alignment than the existing one."
13405,6,"At this moment, forexample, in 1984 (if it was 1984), Oceania was at war with Eurasia andin alliance with Eastasia."
13406,6,In no public or private utterance was it everadmitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along differentlines.
13407,6,"Actually, as Winston well knew, it was only four years since Oceaniahad been at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia."
13408,6,But that wasmerely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess becausehis memory was not satisfactorily under control.
13409,6,Officially the change ofpartners had never happened.
13410,6,Oceania was at war with Eurasia: thereforeOceania had always been at war with Eurasia.
13411,6,"The enemy of the moment alwaysrepresented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or futureagreement with him was impossible.The frightening thing, he reflected for the ten thousandth time as heforced his shoulders painfully backward (with hands on hips, they weregyrating their bodies from the waist, an exercise that was supposed to begood for the back muscles)--the frightening thing was that it might all betrue."
13412,6,"If the Party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this orthat event, IT NEVER HAPPENED--that, surely, was more terrifying than meretorture and death?The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia."
13413,6,"He,Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia as shorta time as four years ago."
13414,6,"But where did that knowledge exist? Only in hisown consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated."
13415,6,And if allothers accepted the lie which the Party imposed--if all records told thesame tale--then the lie passed into history and became truth.
13416,6,"'Who controlsthe past,' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls thepresent controls the past.' And yet the past, though of its naturealterable, never had been altered."
13417,6,Whatever was true now was true fromeverlasting to everlasting.
13418,6,It was quite simple.
13419,6,All that was needed wasan unending series of victories over your own memory.
13420,6,"'Reality control',they called it: in Newspeak, 'doublethink'.'Stand easy!' barked the instructress, a little more genially.Winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled his lungs with air.His mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink."
13421,6,"To knowand not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while tellingcarefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions whichcancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both ofthem, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claimto it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was theguardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, thento draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, andthen promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the same processto the process itself."
13422,6,"That was the ultimate subtlety: consciously toinduce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious ofthe act of hypnosis you had just performed."
13423,6,Even to understand the word'doublethink' involved the use of doublethink.The instructress had called them to attention again.
13424,6,'And now let's seewhich of us can touch our toes!' she said enthusiastically.
13425,6,"'Right overfrom the hips, please, comrades."
13426,6,"ONE-two! ONE-two!...'Winston loathed this exercise, which sent shooting pains all the way fromhis heels to his buttocks and often ended by bringing on another coughingfit."
13427,6,The half-pleasant quality went out of his meditations.
13428,6,"The past, hereflected, had not merely been altered, it had been actually destroyed."
13429,6,Forhow could you establish even the most obvious fact when there existed norecord outside your own memory? He tried to remember in what year he hadfirst heard mention of Big Brother.
13430,6,"He thought it must have been at sometime in the sixties, but it was impossible to be certain."
13431,6,"In the Partyhistories, of course, Big Brother figured as the leader and guardian of theRevolution since its very earliest days."
13432,6,"His exploits had been graduallypushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulousworld of the forties and the thirties, when the capitalists in theirstrange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of London in greatgleaming motor-cars or horse carriages with glass sides."
13433,6,There was noknowing how much of this legend was true and how much invented.
13434,6,Winstoncould not even remember at what date the Party itself had come intoexistence.
13435,6,"He did not believe he had ever heard the word Ingsoc before1960, but it was possible that in its Oldspeak form--'English Socialism',that is to say--it had been current earlier."
13436,6,"Everything melted into mist.Sometimes, indeed, you could put your finger on a definite lie."
13437,6,"It was nottrue, for example, as was claimed in the Party history books, that theParty had invented aeroplanes."
13438,6,He remembered aeroplanes since his earliestchildhood.
13439,6,But you could prove nothing.
13440,6,There was never any evidence.
13441,6,Justonce in his whole life he had held in his hands unmistakable documentaryproof of the falsification of an historical fact.
13442,6,And on that occasion----'Smith!' screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen.
13443,6,"'6079 Smith W.!Yes, YOU! Bend lower, please! You can do better than that."
13444,6,You're nottrying.
13445,6,"Lower, please! THAT'S better, comrade."
13446,6,"Now stand at ease, thewhole squad, and watch me.'A sudden hot sweat had broken out all over Winston's body."
13447,6,His faceremained completely inscrutable.
13448,6,Never show dismay! Never show resentment!A single flicker of the eyes could give you away.
13449,6,"He stood watching whilethe instructress raised her arms above her head and--one could not saygracefully, but with remarkable neatness and efficiency--bent over andtucked the first joint of her fingers under her toes.'THERE, comrades! THAT'S how I want to see you doing it."
13450,6,Watch me again.I'm thirty-nine and I've had four children.
13451,6,Now look.' She bent over again.'You see MY knees aren't bent.
13452,6,"You can all do it if you want to,' she addedas she straightened herself up."
13453,6,'Anyone under forty-five is perfectlycapable of touching his toes.
13454,6,"We don't all have the privilege of fightingin the front line, but at least we can all keep fit."
13455,6,Remember our boys onthe Malabar front! And the sailors in the Floating Fortresses! Just thinkwhat THEY have to put up with.
13456,6,Now try again.
13457,6,"That's better, comrade,that's MUCH better,' she added encouragingly as Winston, with a violentlunge, succeeded in touching his toes with knees unbent, for the firsttime in several years.Chapter 4With the deep, unconscious sigh which not even the nearness of thetelescreen could prevent him from uttering when his day's work started,Winston pulled the speakwrite towards him, blew the dust from itsmouthpiece, and put on his spectacles."
13458,6,Then he unrolled and clippedtogether four small cylinders of paper which had already flopped out ofthe pneumatic tube on the right-hand side of his desk.In the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices.
13459,6,"To the right of thespeakwrite, a small pneumatic tube for written messages, to the left, alarger one for newspapers; and in the side wall, within easy reach ofWinston's arm, a large oblong slit protected by a wire grating."
13460,6,This lastwas for the disposal of waste paper.
13461,6,"Similar slits existed in thousands ortens of thousands throughout the building, not only in every room but atshort intervals in every corridor."
13462,6,For some reason they were nicknamedmemory holes.
13463,6,"When one knew that any document was due for destruction, oreven when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about, it was an automaticaction to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in,whereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormousfurnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building.Winston examined the four slips of paper which he had unrolled."
13464,6,"Eachcontained a message of only one or two lines, in the abbreviatedjargon--not actually Newspeak, but consistinglargely of Newspeak words--which was used in the Ministry for internalpurposes."
13465,6,"They ran:times 17.3.84 bb speech malreported africa rectifytimes 19.12.83 forecasts 3 yp 4th quarter 83 misprints verify current issuetimes 14.2.84 miniplenty malquoted chocolate rectifytimes 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewritefullwise upsub antefilingWith a faint feeling of satisfaction Winston laid the fourth message aside.It was an intricate and responsible job and had better be dealt with last.The other three were routine matters, though the second one would probablymean some tedious wading through lists of figures.Winston dialled 'back numbers' on the telescreen and called for theappropriate issues of 'The Times', which slid out of the pneumatic tubeafter only a few minutes' delay."
13466,6,"The messages he had received referred toarticles or news items which for one reason or another it was thoughtnecessary to alter, or, as the official phrase had it, to rectify."
13467,6,"Forexample, it appeared from 'The Times' of the seventeenth of March that BigBrother, in his speech of the previous day, had predicted that the SouthIndian front would remain quiet but that a Eurasian offensive would shortlybe launched in North Africa."
13468,6,"As it happened, the Eurasian Higher Commandhad launched its offensive in South India and left North Africa alone."
13469,6,"Itwas therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of Big Brother's speech, insuch a way as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened."
13470,6,"Oragain, 'The Times' of the nineteenth of December had published the officialforecasts of the output of various classes of consumption goods in thefourth quarter of 1983, which was also the sixth quarter of the NinthThree-Year Plan."
13471,6,"Today's issue contained a statement of the actual output,from which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grosslywrong."
13472,6,Winston's job was to rectify the original figures by making themagree with the later ones.
13473,6,"As for the third message, it referred to a verysimple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes."
13474,6,"As shorta time ago as February, the Ministry of Plenty had issued a promise(a 'categorical pledge' were the official words) that there would beno reduction of the chocolate ration during 1984."
13475,6,"Actually, as Winstonwas aware, the chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grammesto twenty at the end of the present week."
13476,6,"All that was needed was tosubstitute for the original promise a warning that it would probably benecessary to reduce the ration at some time in April.As soon as Winston had dealt with each of the messages, he clipped hisspeakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of 'The Times' and pushedthem into the pneumatic tube."
13477,6,"Then, with a movement which was as nearly aspossible unconscious, he crumpled up the original message and any notesthat he himself had made, and dropped them into the memory hole to bedevoured by the flames.What happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led, hedid not know in detail, but he did know in general terms."
13478,6,"As soon as allthe corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular numberof 'The Times' had been assembled and collated, that number would bereprinted, the original copy destroyed, and the corrected copy placed onthe files in its stead."
13479,6,"This process of continuous alteration was appliednot only to newspapers, but to books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters,leaflets, films, sound-tracks, cartoons, photographs--to every kind ofliterature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political orideological significance."
13480,6,Day by day and almost minute by minute the pastwas brought up to date.
13481,6,"In this way every prediction made by the Partycould be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct, nor was anyitem of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with theneeds of the moment, ever allowed to remain on record."
13482,6,"All history wasa palimpsest, scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as wasnecessary."
13483,6,"In no case would it have been possible, once the deed was done,to prove that any falsification had taken place."
13484,6,"The largest section ofthe Records Department, far larger than the one on which Winston worked,consisted simply of persons whose duty it was to track down and collect allcopies of books, newspapers, and other documents which had been supersededand were due for destruction."
13485,6,"A number of 'The Times' which might, becauseof changes in political alignment, or mistaken prophecies uttered by BigBrother, have been rewritten a dozen times still stood on the files bearingits original date, and no other copy existed to contradict it."
13486,6,"Books, also,were recalled and rewritten again and again, and were invariably reissuedwithout any admission that any alteration had been made."
13487,6,"Even the writteninstructions which Winston received, and which he invariably got rid ofas soon as he had dealt with them, never stated or implied that an act offorgery was to be committed: always the reference was to slips, errors,misprints, or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in theinterests of accuracy.But actually, he thought as he re-adjusted the Ministry of Plenty'sfigures, it was not even forgery."
13488,6,It was merely the substitution of onepiece of nonsense for another.
13489,6,"Most of the material that you were dealingwith had no connexion with anything in the real world, not even the kind ofconnexion that is c."
13490,6,Mr.
13491,6,"Jones, of the Manor Farm, had locked the hen-houses for the night, butwas too drunk to remember to shut the pop-holes."
13492,6,"With the ring of lightfrom his lantern dancing from side to side, he lurched across the yard,kicked off his boots at the back door, drew himself a last glass of beerfrom the barrel in the scullery, and made his way up to bed, whereMrs."
13493,6,Jones was already snoring.As soon as the light in the bedroom went out there was a stirring and afluttering all through the farm buildings.
13494,6,"Word had gone round during theday that old Major, the prize Middle White boar, had had a strange dreamon the previous night and wished to communicate it to the other animals.It had been agreed that they should all meet in the big barn as soon asMr."
13495,6,Jones was safely out of the way.
13496,6,"Old Major (so he was always called,though the name under which he had been exhibited was Willingdon Beauty)was so highly regarded on the farm that everyone was quite ready to losean hour's sleep in order to hear what he had to say.At one end of the big barn, on a sort of raised platform, Major wasalready ensconced on his bed of straw, under a lantern which hung from abeam."
13497,6,"He was twelve years old and had lately grown rather stout, but hewas still a majestic-looking pig, with a wise and benevolent appearance inspite of the fact that his tushes had never been cut."
13498,6,Before long theother animals began to arrive and make themselves comfortable after theirdifferent fashions.
13499,6,"First came the three dogs, Bluebell, Jessie, andPincher, and then the pigs, who settled down in the straw immediately infront of the platform."
13500,6,"The hens perched themselves on the window-sills,the pigeons fluttered up to the rafters, the sheep and cows lay downbehind the pigs and began to chew the cud."
13501,6,"The two cart-horses, Boxer andClover, came in together, walking very slowly and setting down their vasthairy hoofs with great care lest there should be some small animalconcealed in the straw."
13502,6,"Clover was a stout motherly mare approachingmiddle life, who had never quite got her figure back after her fourth foal.Boxer was an enormous beast, nearly eighteen hands high, and as strong asany two ordinary horses put together."
13503,6,"A white stripe down his nose gavehim a somewhat stupid appearance, and in fact he was not of first-rateintelligence, but he was universally respected for his steadiness ofcharacter and tremendous powers of work."
13504,6,"After the horses came Muriel,the white goat, and Benjamin, the donkey."
13505,6,"Benjamin was the oldest animalon the farm, and the worst tempered."
13506,6,"He seldom talked, and when he did, itwas usually to make some cynical remark--for instance, he would say thatGod had given him a tail to keep the flies off, but that he would soonerhave had no tail and no flies."
13507,6,Alone among the animals on the farm henever laughed.
13508,6,"If asked why, he would say that he saw nothing to laugh at.Nevertheless, without openly admitting it, he was devoted to Boxer; thetwo of them usually spent their Sundays together in the small paddockbeyond the orchard, grazing side by side and never speaking.The two horses had just lain down when a brood of ducklings, which hadlost their mother, filed into the barn, cheeping feebly and wandering fromside to side to find some place where they would not be trodden on."
13509,6,"Clovermade a sort of wall round them with her great foreleg, and the ducklingsnestled down inside it and promptly fell asleep."
13510,6,"At the last momentMollie, the foolish, pretty white mare who drew Mr."
13511,6,"Jones's trap, camemincing daintily in, chewing at a lump of sugar."
13512,6,"She took a place near thefront and began flirting her white mane, hoping to draw attention to thered ribbons it was plaited with."
13513,6,"Last of all came the cat, who lookedround, as usual, for the warmest place, and finally squeezed herself inbetween Boxer and Clover; there she purred contentedly throughout Major'sspeech without listening to a word of what he was saying.All the animals were now present except Moses, the tame raven, who slepton a perch behind the back door."
13514,6,"When Major saw that they had all madethemselves comfortable and were waiting attentively, he cleared his throatand began:""Comrades, you have heard already about the strange dream that I had lastnight."
13515,6,But I will come to the dream later.
13516,6,I have something else to sayfirst.
13517,6,"I do not think, comrades, that I shall be with you for many monthslonger, and before I die, I feel it my duty to pass on to you such wisdomas I have acquired."
13518,6,"I have had a long life, I have had much time forthought as I lay alone in my stall, and I think I may say that Iunderstand the nature of life on this earth as well as any animal nowliving."
13519,6,"It is about this that I wish to speak to you.""Now, comrades, what is the nature of this life of ours? Let us face it:our lives are miserable, laborious, and short."
13520,6,"We are born, we are givenjust so much food as will keep the breath in our bodies, and those of uswho are capable of it are forced to work to the last atom of our strength;and the very instant that our usefulness has come to an end we areslaughtered with hideous cruelty."
13521,6,No animal in England knows the meaningof happiness or leisure after he is a year old.
13522,6,No animal in England isfree.
13523,6,"The life of an animal is misery and slavery: that is the plain truth.""But is this simply part of the order of nature? Is it because this landof ours is so poor that it cannot afford a decent life to those who dwellupon it? No, comrades, a thousand times no! The soil of England isfertile, its climate is good, it is capable of affording food in abundanceto an enormously greater number of animals than now inhabit it."
13524,6,"Thissingle farm of ours would support a dozen horses, twenty cows, hundreds ofsheep--and all of them living in a comfort and a dignity that are nowalmost beyond our imagining."
13525,6,Why then do we continue in this miserablecondition? Because nearly the whole of the produce of our labour is stolenfrom us by human beings.
13526,6,"There, comrades, is the answer to all ourproblems."
13527,6,It is summed up in a single word--Man.
13528,6,Man is the only realenemy we have.
13529,6,"Remove Man from the scene, and the root cause of hunger andoverwork is abolished for ever.""Man is the only creature that consumes without producing."
13530,6,"He does notgive milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, hecannot run fast enough to catch rabbits."
13531,6,Yet he is lord of all theanimals.
13532,6,"He sets them to work, he gives back to them the bare minimum thatwill prevent them from starving, and the rest he keeps for himself."
13533,6,"Ourlabour tills the soil, our dung fertilises it, and yet there is not one ofus that owns more than his bare skin."
13534,6,"You cows that I see before me, howmany thousands of gallons of milk have you given during this last year?And what has happened to that milk which should have been breeding upsturdy calves? Every drop of it has gone down the throats of our enemies.And you hens, how many eggs have you laid in this last year, and how manyof those eggs ever hatched into chickens? The rest have all gone to marketto bring in money for Jones and his men."
13535,6,"And you, Clover, where are thosefour foals you bore, who should have been the support and pleasure of yourold age? Each was sold at a year old--you will never see one of themagain."
13536,6,"In return for your four confinements and all your labour in thefields, what have you ever had except your bare rations and a stall?""And even the miserable lives we lead are not allowed to reach theirnatural span."
13537,6,"For myself I do not grumble, for I am one of the lucky ones.I am twelve years old and have had over four hundred children."
13538,6,Such is thenatural life of a pig.
13539,6,"But no animal escapes the cruel knife in the end.You young porkers who are sitting in front of me, every one of you willscream your lives out at the block within a year."
13540,6,"To that horror we allmust come--cows, pigs, hens, sheep, everyone."
13541,6,Even the horses and the dogshave no better fate.
13542,6,"You, Boxer, the very day that those great muscles ofyours lose their power, Jones will sell you to the knacker, who will cutyour throat and boil you down for the foxhounds."
13543,6,"As for the dogs, whenthey grow old and toothless, Jones ties a brick round their necks anddrowns them in the nearest pond.""Is it not crystal clear, then, comrades, that all the evils of this lifeof ours spring from the tyranny of human beings? Only get rid of Man, andthe produce of our labour would be our own."
13544,6,Almost overnight we couldbecome rich and free.
13545,6,"What then must we do? Why, work night and day, bodyand soul, for the overthrow of the human race! That is my message to you,comrades: Rebellion! I do not know when that Rebellion will come, it mightbe in a week or in a hundred years, but I know, as surely as I see thisstraw beneath my feet, that sooner or later justice will be done."
13546,6,"Fix youreyes on that, comrades, throughout the short remainder of your lives! Andabove all, pass on this message of mine to those who come after you, sothat future generations shall carry on the struggle until it is victorious.""And remember, comrades, your resolution must never falter."
13547,6,No argumentmust lead you astray.
13548,6,"Never listen when they tell you that Man and theanimals have a common interest, that the prosperity of the one is theprosperity of the others."
13549,6,It is all lies.
13550,6,Man serves the interests of nocreature except himself.
13551,6,"And among us animals let there be perfect unity,perfect comradeship in the struggle."
13552,6,All men are enemies.
13553,6,"All animals arecomrades.""At this moment there was a tremendous uproar."
13554,6,"While Major was speakingfour large rats had crept out of their holes and were sitting on theirhindquarters, listening to him."
13555,6,"The dogs had suddenly caught sight ofthem, and it was only by a swift dash for their holes that the rats savedtheir lives."
13556,6,"Major raised his trotter for silence.""Comrades,"" he said, ""here is a point that must be settled."
13557,6,"The wildcreatures, such as rats and rabbits--are they our friends or our enemies?Let us put it to the vote."
13558,6,"I propose this question to the meeting: Arerats comrades?""The vote was taken at once, and it was agreed by an overwhelming majoritythat rats were comrades."
13559,6,"There were only four dissentients, the three dogsand the cat, who was afterwards discovered to have voted on both sides.Major continued:""I have little more to say."
13560,6,"I merely repeat, remember always your duty ofenmity towards Man and all his ways."
13561,6,Whatever goes upon two legs is anenemy.
13562,6,"Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend."
13563,6,"Andremember also that in fighting against Man, we must not come to resemblehim."
13564,6,"Even when you have conquered him, do not adopt his vices."
13565,6,"No animalmust ever live in a house, or sleep in a bed, or wear clothes, or drinkalcohol, or smoke tobacco, or touch money, or engage in trade."
13566,6,All thehabits of Man are evil.
13567,6,"And, above all, no animal must ever tyrannise overhis own kind."
13568,6,"Weak or strong, clever or simple, we are all brothers."
13569,6,Noanimal must ever kill any other animal.
13570,6,"All animals are equal.""And now, comrades, I will tell you about my dream of last night."
13571,6,I cannotdescribe that dream to you.
13572,6,It was a dream of the earth as it will be whenMan has vanished.
13573,6,But it reminded me of something that I had longforgotten.
13574,6,"Many years ago, when I was a little pig, my mother and theother sows used to sing an old song of which they knew only the tune andthe first three words."
13575,6,"I had known that tune in my infancy, but it hadlong since passed out of my mind."
13576,6,"Last night, however, it came back to mein my dream."
13577,6,"And what is more, the words of the song also came back-words,I am certain, which were sung by the animals of long ago and have beenlost to memory for generations."
13578,6,"I will sing you that song now, comrades.I am old and my voice is hoarse, but when I have taught you the tune, youcan sing it better for yourselves."
13579,6,"It is called 'Beasts of England'.""Old Major cleared his throat and began to sing."
13580,6,"As he had said, his voicewas hoarse, but he sang well enough, and it was a stirring tune, somethingbetween 'Clementine' and 'La Cucaracha'."
13581,6,"The words ran:Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland,Beasts of every land and clime,Hearken to my joyful tidingsOf the golden future time.Soon or late the day is coming,Tyrant Man shall be o'erthrown,And the fruitful fields of EnglandShall be trod by beasts alone.Rings shall vanish from our noses,And the harness from our back,Bit and spur shall rust forever,Cruel whips no more shall crack.Riches more than mind can picture,Wheat and barley, oats and hay,Clover, beans, and mangel-wurzelsShall be ours upon that day.Bright will shine the fields of England,Purer shall its waters be,Sweeter yet shall blow its breezesOn the day that sets us free.For that day we all must labour,Though we die before it break;Cows and horses, geese and turkeys,All must toil for freedom's sake.Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland,Beasts of every land and clime,Hearken well and spread my tidingsOf the golden future time.The singing of this song threw the animals into the wildest excitement.Almost before Major had reached the end, they had begun singing it forthemselves."
13582,6,"Even the stupidest of them had already picked up the tune anda few of the words, and as for the clever ones, such as the pigs and dogs,they had the entire song by heart within a few minutes."
13583,6,"And then, after afew preliminary tries, the whole farm burst out into 'Beasts of England' intremendous unison."
13584,6,"The cows lowed it, the dogs whined it, the sheepbleated it, the horses whinnied it, the ducks quacked it."
13585,6,"They were sodelighted with the song that they sang it right through five times insuccession, and might have continued singing it all night if they had notbeen interrupted.Unfortunately, the uproar awoke Mr."
13586,6,"Jones, who sprang out of bed, makingsure that there was a fox in the yard."
13587,6,"He seized the gun which alwaysstood in a corner of his bedroom, and let fly a charge of number 6 shotinto the darkness."
13588,6,The pellets buried themselves in the wall of the barnand the meeting broke up hurriedly.
13589,6,Everyone fled to his ownsleeping-place.
13590,6,"The birds jumped on to their perches, the animals settleddown in the straw, and the whole farm was asleep in a moment.Chapter IIThree nights later old Major died peacefully in his sleep."
13591,6,His body wasburied at the foot of the orchard.This was early in March.
13592,6,During the next three months there was muchsecret activity.
13593,6,Major's speech had given to the more intelligent animalson the farm a completely new outlook on life.
13594,6,"They did not know when theRebellion predicted by Major would take place, they had no reason forthinking that it would be within their own lifetime, but they saw clearlythat it was their duty to prepare for it."
13595,6,"The work of teaching andorganising the others fell naturally upon the pigs, who were generallyrecognised as being the cleverest of the animals."
13596,6,"Pre-eminent among thepigs were two young boars named Snowball and Napoleon, whom Mr."
13597,6,Jones wasbreeding up for sale.
13598,6,"Napoleon was a large, rather fierce-lookingBerkshire boar, the only Berkshire on the farm, not much of a talker, butwith a reputation for getting his own way."
13599,6,"Snowball was a more vivaciouspig than Napoleon, quicker in speech and more inventive, but was notconsidered to have the same depth of character."
13600,6,All the other male pigs onthe farm were porkers.
13601,6,"The best known among them was a small fat pig namedSquealer, with very round cheeks, twinkling eyes, nimble movements, and ashrill voice."
13602,6,"He was a brilliant talker, and when he was arguing somedifficult point he had a way of skipping from side to side and whiskinghis tail which was somehow very persuasive."
13603,6,"The others said of Squealerthat he could turn black into white.These three had elaborated old Major's teachings into a complete system ofthought, to which they gave the name of Animalism."
13604,6,"Several nights a week,after Mr."
13605,6,"Jones was asleep, they held secret meetings in the barn andexpounded the principles of Animalism to the others."
13606,6,At the beginning theymet with much stupidity and apathy.
13607,6,Some of the animals talked of the dutyof loyalty to Mr.
13608,6,"Jones, whom they referred to as ""Master,"" or madeelementary remarks such as ""Mr."
13609,6,Jones feeds us.
13610,6,"If he were gone, we shouldstarve to death."" Others asked such questions as ""Why should we care whathappens after we are dead?"" or ""If this Rebellion is to happen anyway,what difference does it make whether we work for it or not?"", and the pigshad great difficulty in making them see that this was contrary to thespirit of Animalism."
13611,6,"The stupidest questions of all were asked by Mollie,the white mare."
13612,6,"The very first question she asked Snowball was: ""Willthere still be sugar after the Rebellion?""""No,"" said Snowball firmly."
13613,6,"""We have no means of making sugar on thisfarm."
13614,6,"Besides, you do not need sugar."
13615,6,"You will have all the oats and hayyou want.""""And shall I still be allowed to wear ribbons in my mane?"" asked Mollie.""Comrade,"" said Snowball, ""those ribbons that you are so devoted to arethe badge of slavery."
13616,6,"Can you not understand that liberty is worth morethan ribbons?""Mollie agreed, but she did not sound very convinced.The pigs had an even harder struggle to counteract the lies put about byMoses, the tame raven."
13617,6,"Moses, who was Mr."
13618,6,"Jones's especial pet, was a spyand a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever talker."
13619,6,"He claimed to know ofthe existence of a mysterious country called Sugarcandy Mountain, to whichall animals went when they died."
13620,6,"It was situated somewhere up in the sky,a little distance beyond the clouds, Moses said."
13621,6,"In Sugarcandy Mountain itwas Sunday seven days a week, clover was in season all the year round, andlump sugar and linseed cake grew on the hedges."
13622,6,"The animals hated Mosesbecause he told tales and did no work, but some of them believed inSugarcandy Mountain, and the pigs had to argue very hard to persuade themthat there was no such place.Their most faithful disciples were the two cart-horses, Boxer and Clover.These two had great difficulty in thinking anything out for themselves,but having once accepted the pigs as their teachers, they absorbedeverything that they were told, and passed it on to the other animals bysimple arguments."
13623,6,"They were unfailing in their attendance at the secretmeetings in the barn, and led the singing of 'Beasts of England', withwhich the meetings always ended.Now, as it turned out, the Rebellion was achieved much earlier and moreeasily than anyone had expected."
13624,6,In past years Mr.
13625,6,"Jones, although a hardmaster, had been a capable farmer, but of late he had fallen on evil days.He had become much disheartened after losing money in a lawsuit, and hadtaken to drinking more than was good for him."
13626,6,"For whole days at a time hewould lounge in his Windsor chair in the kitchen, reading the newspapers,drinking, and occasionally feeding Moses on crusts of bread soaked inbeer."
13627,6,"His men were idle and dishonest, the fields were full of weeds, thebuildings wanted roofing, the hedges were neglected, and the animals wereunderfed.June came and the hay was almost ready for cutting."
13628,6,"On Midsummer's Eve,which was a Saturday, Mr."
13629,6,Jones went into Willingdon and got so drunk atthe Red Lion that he did not come back till midday on Sunday.
13630,6,"The men hadmilked the cows in the early morning and then had gone out rabbiting,without bothering to feed the animals."
13631,6,When Mr.
13632,6,"Jones got back heimmediately went to sleep on the drawing-room sofa with the News of theWorld over his face, so that when evening came, the animals were stillunfed."
13633,6,At last they could stand it no longer.
13634,6,One of the cows broke in thedoor of the store-shed with her horn and all the animals began to helpthemselves from the bins.
13635,6,It was just then that Mr.
13636,6,Jones woke up.
13637,6,"Thenext moment he and his four men were in the store-shed with whips in theirhands, lashing out in all directions."
13638,6,This was more than the hungryanimals could bear.
13639,6,"With one accord, though nothing of the kind had beenplanned beforehand, they flung themselves upon their tormentors."
13640,6,Jones andhis men suddenly found themselves being butted and kicked from all sides.The situation was quite out of their control.
13641,6,"They had never seen animalsbehave like this before, and this sudden uprising of creatures whom theywere used to thrashing and maltreating just as they chose, frightened themalmost out of their wits."
13642,6,After only a moment or two they gave up tryingto defend themselves and took to their heels.
13643,6,"A minute later all five ofthem were in full flight down the cart-track that led to the main road,with the animals pursuing them in triumph.Mrs."
13644,6,"Jones looked out of the bedroom window, saw what was happening,hurriedly flung a few possessions into a carpet bag, and slipped out ofthe farm by another way."
13645,6,"Moses sprang off his perch and flapped after her,croaking loudly."
13646,6,Meanwhile the animals had chased Jones and his men out onto the road and slammed the five-barred gate behind them.
13647,6,"And so, almostbefore they knew what was happening, the Rebellion had been successfullycarried through: Jones was expelled, and the Manor Farm was theirs.For the first few minutes the animals could hardly believe in their goodfortune."
13648,6,"Their first act was to gallop in a body right round theboundaries of the farm, as though to make quite sure that no human beingwas hiding anywhere upon it; then they raced back to the farm buildings towipe out the last traces of Jones's hated reign."
13649,6,"The harness-room at theend of the stables was broken open; the bits, the nose-rings, thedog-chains, the cruel knives with which Mr."
13650,6,"Jones had been used tocastrate the pigs and lambs, were all flung down the well."
13651,6,"The reins, thehalters, the blinkers, the degrading nosebags, were thrown on to therubbish fire which was burning in the yard."
13652,6,So were the whips.
13653,6,"All theanimals capered with joy when they saw the whips going up in flames.Snowball also threw on to the fire the ribbons with which the horses'manes and tails had usually been decorated on market days.""Ribbons,"" he said, ""should be considered as clothes, which are the markof a human being."
13654,6,"All animals should go naked.""When Boxer heard this he fetched the small straw hat which he wore insummer to keep the flies out of his ears, and flung it on to the fire withthe rest.In a very little while the animals had destroyed everything that remindedthem of Mr."
13655,6,Jones.
13656,6,"Napoleon then led them back to the store-shed andserved out a double ration of corn to everybody, with two biscuits foreach dog."
13657,6,"Then they sang 'Beasts of England' from end to end seven timesrunning, and after that they settled down for the night and slept as theyhad never slept before.But they woke at dawn as usual, and suddenly remembering the gloriousthing that had happened, they all raced out into the pasture together."
13658,6,Alittle way down the pasture there was a knoll that commanded a view ofmost of the farm.
13659,6,The animals rushed to the top of it and gazed round themin the clear morning light.
13660,6,"Yes, it was theirs--everything that they couldsee was theirs! In the ecstasy of that thought they gambolled round andround, they hurled themselves into the air in great leaps of excitement.They rolled in the dew, they cropped mouthfuls of the sweet summer grass,they kicked up clods of the black earth and snuffed its rich scent."
13661,6,"Thenthey made a tour of inspection of the whole farm and surveyed withspeechless admiration the ploughland, the hayfield, the orchard, the pool,the spinney."
13662,6,"It was as though they had never seen these things before, andeven now they could hardly believe that it was all their own.Then they filed back to the farm buildings and halted in silence outsidethe door of the farmhouse."
13663,6,"That was theirs too, but they were frightenedto go inside."
13664,6,"After a moment, however, Snowball and Napoleon butted thedoor open with their shoulders and the animals entered in single file,walking with the utmost care for fear of disturbing anything."
13665,6,"They tiptoedfrom room to room, afraid to speak above a whisper and gazing with a kindof awe at the unbelievable luxury, at the beds with their feathermattresses, the looking-glasses, the horsehair sofa, the Brussels carpet,the lithograph of Queen Victoria over the drawing-room mantelpiece."
13666,6,"Theywere just coming down the stairs when Mollie was discovered to be missing.Going back, the others found that she had remained behind in the bestbedroom."
13667,6,She had taken a piece of blue ribbon from Mrs.
13668,6,"Jones'sdressing-table, and was holding it against her shoulder and admiringherself in the glass in a very foolish manner."
13669,6,"The others reproached hersharply, and they went outside."
13670,6,"Some hams hanging in the kitchen weretaken out for burial, and the barrel of beer in the scullery was stove inwith a kick from Boxer's hoof, otherwise nothing in the house was touched.A unanimous resolution was passed on the spot that the farmhouse should bepreserved as a museum."
13671,6,"All were agreed that no animal must ever live there.The animals had their breakfast, and then Snowball and Napoleon calledthem together again.""Comrades,"" said Snowball, ""it is half-past six and we have a long daybefore us."
13672,6,Today we begin the hay harvest.
13673,6,"But there is another matterthat must be attended to first.""The pigs now revealed that during the past three months they had taughtthemselves to read and write from an old spelling book which had belongedto Mr."
13674,6,Jones's children and which had been thrown on the rubbish heap.Napoleon sent for pots of black and white paint and led the way down tothe five-barred gate that gave on to the main road.
13675,6,"Then Snowball (for itwas Snowball who was best at writing) took a brush between the twoknuckles of his trotter, painted out MANOR FARM from the top bar of thegate and in its place painted ANIMAL FARM."
13676,6,This was to be the name of thefarm from now onwards.
13677,6,"After this they went back to the farm buildings,where Snowball and Napoleon sent for a ladder which they caused to be setagainst the end wall of the big barn."
13678,6,They explained that by their studiesof the past three months the pigs had succeeded in reducing the principlesof Animalism to Seven Commandments.
13679,6,These Seven Commandments would now beinscribed on the wall; they would form an unalterable law by which all theanimals on Animal Farm must live for ever after.
13680,6,"With some difficulty(for it is not easy for a pig to balance himself on a ladder) Snowballclimbed up and set to work, with Squealer a few rungs below him holdingthe paint-pot."
13681,6,The Commandments were written on the tarred wall in greatwhite letters that could be read thirty yards away.
13682,6,They ran thus:THE SEVEN COMMANDMENTS1.
13683,6,Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.2.
13684,6,"Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.3."
13685,6,No animal shall wear clothes.4.
13686,6,No animal shall sleep in a bed.5.
13687,6,No animal shall drink alcohol.6.
13688,6,No animal shall kill any other animal.7.
13689,6,"All animals are equal.It was very neatly written, and except that ""friend"" was written ""freind""and one of the ""S's"" was the wrong way round, the spelling was correct allthe way through."
13690,6,Snowball read it aloud for the benefit of the others.
13691,6,"Allthe animals nodded in complete agreement, and the cleverer ones at oncebegan to learn the Commandments by heart.""Now, comrades,"" cried Snowball, throwing down the paint-brush, ""to thehayfield! Let us make it a point of honour to get in the harvest morequickly than Jones and his men could do.""But at this moment the three cows, who had seemed uneasy for some timepast, set up a loud lowing."
13692,6,"They had not been milked for twenty-fourhours, and their udders were almost bursting."
13693,6,"After a little thought, thepigs sent for buckets and milked the cows fairly successfully, theirtrotters being well adapted to this task."
13694,6,"Soon there were five buckets offrothing creamy milk at which many of the animals looked with considerableinterest.""What is going to happen to all that milk?"" said someone.""Jones used sometimes to mix some of it in our mash,"" said one of the hens.""Never mind the milk, comrades!"" cried Napoleon, placing himself in frontof the buckets."
13695,6,"""That will be attended to."
13696,6,The harvest is more important.Comrade Snowball will lead the way.
13697,6,"I shall follow in a few minutes.Forward, comrades! The hay is waiting.""So the animals trooped down to the hayfield to begin the harvest, and whenthey came back in the evening it was noticed that the milk had disappeared.Chapter IIIHow they toiled and sweated to get the hay in! But their efforts wererewarded, for the harvest was an even bigger success than they had hoped.Sometimes the work was hard; the implements had been designed for humanbeings and not for animals, and it was a great drawback that no animal wasable to use any tool that involved standing on his hind legs."
13698,6,But the pigswere so clever that they could think of a way round every difficulty.
13699,6,"Asfor the horses, they knew every inch of the field, and in fact understoodthe business of mowing and raking far better than Jones and his men hadever done."
13700,6,"The pigs did not actually work, but directed and supervised theothers."
13701,6,With their superior knowledge it was natural that they shouldassume the leadership.
13702,6,"Boxer and Clover would harness themselves to thecutter or the horse-rake (no bits or reins were needed in these days, ofcourse) and tramp steadily round and round the field with a pig walkingbehind and calling out ""Gee up, comrade!"" or ""Whoa back, comrade!"" as thecase might be."
13703,6,And every animal down to the humblest worked at turning thehay and gathering it.
13704,6,"Even the ducks and hens toiled to and fro all day inthe sun, carrying tiny wisps of hay in their beaks."
13705,6,In the end theyfinished the harvest in two days' less time than it had usually takenJones and his men.
13706,6,"Moreover, it was the biggest harvest that the farm hadever seen."
13707,6,There was no wastage whatever; the hens and ducks with theirsharp eyes had gathered up the very last stalk.
13708,6,And not an animal on thefarm had stolen so much as a mouthful.All through that summer the work of the farm went like clockwork.
13709,6,Theanimals were happy as they had never conceived it possible to be.
13710,6,"Everymouthful of food was an acute positive pleasure, now that it was trulytheir own food, produced by themselves and for themselves, not doled outto them by a grudging master."
13711,6,"With the worthless parasitical human beingsgone, there was more for everyone to eat."
13712,6,"There was more leisure too,inexperienced though the animals were."
13713,6,"They met with many difficulties--forinstance, later in the year, when they harvested the corn, they had totread it out in the ancient style and blow away the chaff with theirbreath, since the farm possessed no threshing machine--but the pigs withtheir cleverness and Boxer with his tremendous muscles always pulled themthrough."
13714,6,Boxer was the admiration of everybody.
13715,6,"He had been a hard workereven in Jones's time, but now he seemed more like three horses than one;there were days when the entire work of the farm seemed to rest on hismighty shoulders."
13716,6,"From morning to night he was pushing and pulling, alwaysat the spot where the work was hardest."
13717,6,"He had made an arrangement withone of the cockerels to call him in the mornings half an hour earlier thananyone else, and would put in some volunteer labour at whatever seemed tobe most needed, before the regular day's work began."
13718,6,"His answer to everyproblem, every setback, was ""I will work harder!""--which he had adopted ashis personal motto.But everyone worked according to his capacity."
13719,6,"The hens and ducks, forinstance, saved five bushels of corn at the harvest by gathering up thestray grains."
13720,6,"Nobody stole, nobody grumbled over his rations, thequarrelling and biting and jealousy which had been normal features of lifein the old days had almost disappeared."
13721,6,"Nobody shirked--or almost nobody.Mollie, it was true, was not good at getting up in the mornings, and had away of leaving work early on the ground that there was a stone in herhoof."
13722,6,And the behaviour of the cat was somewhat peculiar.
13723,6,"It was soonnoticed that when there was work to be done the cat could never be found.She would vanish for hours on end, and then reappear at meal-times, or inthe evening after work was over, as though nothing had happened."
13724,6,"But shealways made such excellent excuses, and purred so affectionately, that itwas impossible not to believe in her good intentions."
13725,6,"Old Benjamin, thedonkey, seemed quite unchanged since the Rebellion."
13726,6,"He did his work in thesame slow obstinate way as he had done it in Jones's time, never shirkingand never volunteering for extra work either."
13727,6,About the Rebellion and itsresults he would express no opinion.
13728,6,"When asked whether he was not happiernow that Jones was gone, he would say only ""Donkeys live a long time."
13729,6,"Noneof you has ever seen a dead donkey,"" and the others had to be content withthis cryptic answer.On Sundays there was no work."
13730,6,"Breakfast was an hour later than usual, andafter breakfast there was a ceremony which was observed every week withoutfail."
13731,6,First came the hoisting of the flag.
13732,6,Snowball had found in theharness-room an old green tablecloth of Mrs.
13733,6,Jones's and had painted on ita hoof and a horn in white.
13734,6,This was run up the flagstaff in the farmhousegarden every Sunday morning.
13735,6,"The flag was green, Snowball explained, torepresent the green fields of England, while the hoof and horn signifiedthe future Republic of the Animals which would arise when the human racehad been finally overthrown."
13736,6,After the hoisting of the flag all theanimals trooped into the big barn for a general assembly which was knownas the Meeting.
13737,6,Here the work of the coming week was planned out andresolutions were put forward and debated.
13738,6,It was always the pigs who putforward the resolutions.
13739,6,"The other animals understood how to vote, butcould never think of any resolutions of their own."
13740,6,Snowball and Napoleonwere by far the most active in the debates.
13741,6,"But it was noticed that thesetwo were never in agreement: whatever suggestion either of them made, theother could be counted on to oppose it."
13742,6,"Even when it was resolved--a thingno one could object to in itself--to set aside the small paddock behindthe orchard as a home of rest for animals who were past work, there was astormy debate over the correct retiring age for each class of animal."
13743,6,"TheMeeting always ended with the singing of 'Beasts of England', and theafternoon was given up to recreation.The pigs had set aside the harness-room as a headquarters for themselves.Here, in the evenings, they studied blacksmithing, carpentering, and othernecessary arts from books which they had brought out of the farmhouse.Snowball also busied himself with organising the other animals into whathe called Animal Committees."
13744,6,He was indefatigable at this.
13745,6,"He formed theEgg Production Committee for the hens, the Clean Tails League for thecows, the Wild Comrades' Re-education Committee (the object of this was totame the rats and rabbits), the Whiter Wool Movement for the sheep, andvarious others, besides instituting classes in reading and writing."
13746,6,"On thewhole, these projects were a failure."
13747,6,"The attempt to tame the wildcreatures, for instance, broke down almost immediately."
13748,6,"They continued tobehave very much as before, and when treated with generosity, simply tookadvantage of it."
13749,6,The cat joined the Re-education Committee and was veryactive in it for some days.
13750,6,She was seen one day sitting on a roof andtalking to some sparrows who were just out of her reach.
13751,6,"She was tellingthem that all animals were now comrades and that any sparrow who chosecould come and perch on her paw; but the sparrows kept their distance.The reading and writing classes, however, were a great success."
13752,6,"By theautumn almost every animal on the farm was literate in some degree.As for the pigs, they could already read and write perfectly."
13753,6,"The dogslearned to read fairly well, but were not interested in reading anythingexcept the Seven Commandments."
13754,6,"Muriel, the goat, could read somewhatbetter than the dogs, and sometimes used to read to the others in theevenings from scraps of newspaper which she found on the rubbish heap.Benjamin could read as well as any pig, but never exercised his faculty.So far as he knew, he said, there was nothing worth reading."
13755,6,"Clover learntthe whole alphabet, but could not put words together."
13756,6,Boxer could not getbeyond the letter D.
13757,6,"He would trace out A, B, C, D, in the dust with hisgreat hoof, and then would stand staring at the letters with his earsback, sometimes shaking his forelock, trying with all his might toremember what came next and never succeeding."
13758,6,"On several occasions,indeed, he did learn E, F, G, H, but by the time he knew them, it wasalways discovered that he had forgotten A, B, C, and D."
13759,6,"Finally he decidedto be content with the first four letters, and used to write them out onceor twice every day to refresh his memory."
13760,6,Mollie refused to learn any butthe six letters which spelt her own name.
13761,6,"She would form these very neatlyout of pieces of twig, and would then decorate them with a flower or twoand walk round them admiring them.None of the other animals on the farm could get further than the letter A.It was also found that the stupider animals, such as the sheep, hens, andducks, were unable to learn the Seven Commandments by heart."
13762,6,"After muchthought Snowball declared that the Seven Commandments could in effect bereduced to a single maxim, namely: ""Four legs good, two legs bad."" This,he said, contained the essential principle of Animalism."
13763,6,Whoever hadthoroughly grasped it would be safe from human influences.
13764,6,"The birds atfirst objected, since it seemed to them that they also had two legs, butSnowball proved to them that this was not so.""A bird's wing, comrades,"" he said, ""is an organ of propulsion and not ofmanipulation."
13765,6,It should therefore be regarded as a leg.
13766,6,"The distinguishingmark of man is the HAND, the instrument with which he does all hismischief.""The birds did not understand Snowball's long words, but they accepted hisexplanation, and all the humbler animals set to work to learn the newmaxim by heart."
13767,6,"FOUR LEGS GOOD, TWO LEGS BAD, was inscribed on the endwall of the barn, above the Seven Commandments and in bigger letters."
13768,6,"Whenthey had once got it by heart, the sheep developed a great liking for thismaxim, and often as they lay in the field they would all start bleating""Four legs good, two legs bad! Four legs good, two legs bad!"" and keep itup for hours on end, never growing tired of it.Napoleon took no interest in Snowball's committees."
13769,6,He said that theeducation of the young was more important than anything that could be donefor those who were already grown up.
13770,6,"It happened that Jessie and Bluebellhad both whelped soon after the hay harvest, giving birth between them tonine sturdy puppies."
13771,6,"As soon as they were weaned, Napoleon took them awayfrom their mothers, saying that he would make himself responsible fortheir education."
13772,6,"He took them up into a loft which could only be reachedby a ladder from the harness-room, and there kept them in such seclusionthat the rest of the farm soon forgot their existence.The mystery of where the milk went to was soon cleared up."
13773,6,It was mixedevery day into the pigs' mash.
13774,6,"The early apples were now ripening, and thegrass of the orchard was littered with windfalls."
13775,6,"The animals had assumedas a matter of course that these would be shared out equally; one day,however, the order went forth that all the windfalls were to be collectedand brought to the harness-room for the use of the pigs."
13776,6,"At this some ofthe other animals murmured, but it was no use."
13777,6,"All the pigs were in fullagreement on this point, even Snowball and Napoleon."
13778,6,"Squealer was sent tomake the necessary explanations to the others.""Comrades!"" he cried."
13779,6,"""You do not imagine, I hope, that we pigs are doingthis in a spirit of selfishness and privilege? Many of us actually dislikemilk and apples."
13780,6,I dislike them myself.
13781,6,Our sole object in taking thesethings is to preserve our health.
13782,6,"Milk and apples (this has been proved byScience, comrades) contain substances absolutely necessary to thewell-being of a pig."
13783,6,We pigs are brainworkers.
13784,6,The whole management andorganisation of this farm depend on us.
13785,6,Day and night we are watching overyour welfare.
13786,6,It is for YOUR sake that we drink that milk and eat thoseapples.
13787,6,"Do you know what would happen if we pigs failed in our duty? Joneswould come back! Yes, Jones would come back! Surely, comrades,"" criedSquealer almost pleadingly, skipping from side to side and whisking histail, ""surely there is no one among you who wants to see Jones come back?""Now if there was one thing that the animals were completely certain of, itwas that they did not want Jones back."
13788,6,"When it was put to them in thislight, they had no more to say."
13789,6,The importance of keeping the pigs in goodhealth was all too obvious.
13790,6,So it was agreed without further argument thatthe milk and the windfall apples (and also the main crop of apples whenthey ripened) should be reserved for the pigs alone.Chapter IVBy the late summer the news of what had happened on Animal Farm had spreadacross half the county.
13791,6,"Every day Snowball and Napoleon sent out flightsof pigeons whose instructions were to mingle with the animals onneighbouring farms, tell them the story of the Rebellion, and teach themthe tune of 'Beasts of England'.Most of this time Mr."
13792,6,"Jones had spent sitting in the taproom of the RedLion at Willingdon, complaining to anyone who would listen of themonstrous injustice he had suffered in being turned out of his property bya pack of good-for-nothing animals."
13793,6,"The other farmers sympathised inprinciple, but they did not at first give him much help."
13794,6,"At heart, each ofthem was secretly wondering whether he could not somehow turn Jones'smisfortune to his own advantage."
13795,6,It was lucky that the owners of the twofarms which adjoined Animal Farm were on permanently bad terms.
13796,6,"One ofthem, which was named Foxwood, was a large, neglected, old-fashioned farm,much overgrown by woodland, with all its pastures worn out and its hedgesin a disgraceful condition."
13797,6,"Its owner, Mr."
13798,6,"Pilkington, was an easy-goinggentleman farmer who spent most of his time in fishing or huntingaccording to the season."
13799,6,"The other farm, which was called Pinchfield, wassmaller and better kept."
13800,6,Its owner was a Mr.
13801,6,"Frederick, a tough, shrewdman, perpetually involved in lawsuits and with a name for driving hardbargains."
13802,6,"These two disliked each other so much that it was difficult forthem to come to any agreement, even in defence of their own interests.Nevertheless, they were both thoroughly frightened by the rebellion onAnimal Farm, and very anxious to prevent their own animals from learningtoo much about it."
13803,6,At first they pretended to laugh to scorn the idea ofanimals managing a farm for themselves.
13804,6,"The whole thing would be over in afortnight, they said."
13805,6,"They put it about that the animals on the Manor Farm(they insisted on calling it the Manor Farm; they would not tolerate thename ""Animal Farm"") were perpetually fighting among themselves and werealso rapidly starving to death."
13806,6,"When time passed and the animals hadevidently not starved to death, Frederick and Pilkington changed theirtune and began to talk of the terrible wickedness that now flourished onAnimal Farm."
13807,6,"It was given out that the animals there practised cannibalism,tortured one another with red-hot horseshoes, and had their females incommon."
13808,6,"This was what came of rebelling against the laws of Nature,Frederick and Pilkington said.However, these stories were never fully believed."
13809,6,"Rumours of a wonderfulfarm, where the human beings had been turned out and the animals managedtheir own affairs, continued to circulate in vague and distorted forms,and throughout that year a wave of rebelliousness ran through thecountryside."
13810,6,"Bulls which had always been tractable suddenly turned savage,sheep broke down hedges and devoured the clover, cows kicked the pailover, hunters refused their fences and shot their riders on to the otherside."
13811,6,"Above all, the tune and even the words of 'Beasts of England' wereknown everywhere."
13812,6,It had spread with astonishing speed.
13813,6,"The human beingscould not contain their rage when they heard this song, though theypretended to think it merely ridiculous."
13814,6,"They could not understand, theysaid, how even animals could bring themselves to sing such contemptiblerubbish."
13815,6,Any animal caught singing it was given a flogging on the spot.And yet the song was irrepressible.
13816,6,"The blackbirds whistled it in thehedges, the pigeons cooed it in the elms, it got into the din of thesmithies and the tune of the church bells."
13817,6,"And when the human beingslistened to it, they secretly trembled, hearing in it a prophecy of theirfuture doom.Early in October, when the corn was cut and stacked and some of it wasalready threshed, a flight of pigeons came whirling through the air andalighted in the yard of Animal Farm in the wildest excitement."
13818,6,"Jones andall his men, with half a dozen others from Foxwood and Pinchfield, hadentered the five-barred gate and were coming up the cart-track that led tothe farm."
13819,6,"They were all carrying sticks, except Jones, who was marchingahead with a gun in his hands."
13820,6,"Obviously they were going to attempt therecapture of the farm.This had long been expected, and all preparations had been made."
13821,6,"Snowball,who had studied an old book of Julius Caesar's campaigns which he hadfound in the farmhouse, was in charge of the defensive operations."
13822,6,"He gavehis orders quickly, and in a couple of minutes every animal was at hispost.As the human beings approached the farm buildings, Snowball launched hisfirst attack."
13823,6,"All the pigeons, to the number of thirty-five, flew to andfro over the men's heads and muted upon them from mid-air; and while themen were dealing with this, the geese, who had been hiding behind thehedge, rushed out and pecked viciously at the calves of their legs.However, this was only a light skirmishing manoeuvre, intended to create alittle disorder, and the men easily drove the geese off with their sticks.Snowball now launched his second line of attack."
13824,6,"Muriel, Benjamin, and allthe sheep, with Snowball at the head of them, rushed forward and proddedand butted the men from every side, while Benjamin turned around andlashed at them with his small hoofs."
13825,6,"But once again the men, with theirsticks and their hobnailed boots, were too strong for them; and suddenly,at a squeal from Snowball, which was the signal for retreat, all theanimals turned and fled through the gateway into the yard.The men gave a shout of triumph."
13826,6,"They saw, as they imagined, their enemiesin flight, and they rushed after them in disorder."
13827,6,This was just whatSnowball had intended.
13828,6,"As soon as they were well inside the yard, thethree horses, the three cows, and the rest of the pigs, who had been lyingin ambush in the cowshed, suddenly emerged in their rear, cutting themoff."
13829,6,Snowball now gave the signal for the charge.
13830,6,He himself dashedstraight for Jones.
13831,6,"Jones saw him coming, raised his gun and fired."
13832,6,"Thepellets scored bloody streaks along Snowball's back, and a sheep droppeddead."
13833,6,"Without halting for an instant, Snowball flung his fifteen stoneagainst Jones's legs."
13834,6,Jones was hurled into a pile of dung and his gunflew out of his hands.
13835,6,"But the most terrifying spectacle of all was Boxer,rearing up on his hind legs and striking out with his great iron-shodhoofs like a stallion."
13836,6,His very first blow took a stable-lad from Foxwoodon the skull and stretched him lifeless in the mud.
13837,6,"At the sight, severalmen dropped their sticks and tried to run."
13838,6,"Panic overtook them, and thenext moment all the animals together were chasing them round and round theyard."
13839,6,"They were gored, kicked, bitten, trampled on."
13840,6,There was not ananimal on the farm that did not take vengeance on them after his ownfashion.
13841,6,"Even the cat suddenly leapt off a roof onto a cowman's shouldersand sank her claws in his neck, at which he yelled horribly."
13842,6,"At a momentwhen the opening was clear, the men were glad enough to rush out of theyard and make a bolt for the main road."
13843,6,"And so within five minutes oftheir invasion they were in ignominious retreat by the same way as theyhad come, with a flock of geese hissing after them and pecking at theircalves all the way.All the men were gone except one."
13844,6,"Back in the yard Boxer was pawing withhis hoof at the stable-lad who lay face down in the mud, trying to turnhim over."
13845,6,"The boy did not stir.""He is dead,"" said Boxer sorrowfully."
13846,6,"""I had no intention of doing that.I forgot that I was wearing iron shoes."
13847,6,"Who will believe that I did not dothis on purpose?""""No sentimentality, comrade!"" cried Snowball from whose wounds the bloodwas still dripping."
13848,6,"""War is war."
13849,6,"The only good human being is a dead one.""""I have no wish to take life, not even human life,"" repeated Boxer, andhis eyes were full of tears.""Where is Mollie?"" exclaimed somebody.Mollie in fact was missing."
13850,6,"For a moment there was great alarm; it wasfeared that the men might have harmed her in some way, or even carried heroff with them."
13851,6,"In the end, however, she was found hiding in her stall withher head buried among the hay in the manger."
13852,6,She had taken to flight assoon as the gun went off.
13853,6,"And when the others came back from looking forher, it was to find that the stable-lad, who in fact was only stunned, hadalready recovered and made off.The animals had now reassembled in the wildest excitement, each recountinghis own exploits in the battle at the top of his voice."
13854,6,An impromptucelebration of the victory was held immediately.
13855,6,"The flag was run up and'Beasts of England' was sung a number of times, then the sheep who had beenkilled was given a solemn funeral, a hawthorn bush being planted on hergrave."
13856,6,"At the graveside Snowball made a little speech, emphasising theneed for all animals to be ready to die for Animal Farm if need be.The animals decided unanimously to create a military decoration, ""AnimalHero, First Class,"" which was conferred there and then on Snowball andBoxer."
13857,6,"It consisted of a brass medal (they were really some oldhorse-brasses which had been found in the harness-room), to be worn onSundays and holidays."
13858,6,"There was also ""Animal Hero, Second Class,"" whichwas conferred posthumously on the dead sheep.There was much discussion as to what the battle should be called."
13859,6,"In theend, it was named the Battle of the Cowshed, since that was where theambush had been sprung."
13860,6,Mr.
13861,6,"Jones's gun had been found lying in the mud,and it was known that there was a supply of cartridges in the farmhouse.It was decided to set the gun up at the foot of the Flagstaff, like apiece of artillery, and to fire it twice a year--once on October thetwelfth, the anniversary of the Battle of the Cowshed, and once onMidsummer Day, the anniversary of the Rebellion.Chapter VAs winter drew on, Mollie became more and more troublesome."
13862,6,"She was latefor work every morning and excused herself by saying that she hadoverslept, and she complained of mysterious pains, although her appetitewas excellent."
13863,6,"On every kind of pretext she would run away from work andgo to the drinking pool, where she would stand foolishly gazing at her ownreflection in the water."
13864,6,But there were also rumours of something moreserious.
13865,6,"One day, as Mollie strolled blithely into the yard, flirting herlong tail and chewing at a stalk of hay, Clover took her aside.""Mollie,"" she said, ""I have something very serious to say to you."
13866,6,Thismorning I saw you looking over the hedge that divides Animal Farm fromFoxwood.
13867,6,One of Mr.
13868,6,Pilkington's men was standing on the other side of thehedge.
13869,6,"And--I was a long way away, but I am almost certain I saw this--hewas talking to you and you were allowing him to stroke your nose."
13870,6,"Whatdoes that mean, Mollie?""""He didn't! I wasn't! It isn't true!"" cried Mollie, beginning to pranceabout and paw the ground.""Mollie! Look me in the face."
13871,6,"Do you give me your word of honour that thatman was not stroking your nose?""""It isn't true!"" repeated Mollie, but she could not look Clover in theface, and the next moment she took to her heels and galloped away into thefield.A thought struck Clover."
13872,6,"Without saying anything to the others, she wentto Mollie's stall and turned over the straw with her hoof."
13873,6,Hidden underthe straw was a little pile of lump sugar and several bunches of ribbon ofdifferent colours.Three days later Mollie disappeared.
13874,6,"For some weeks nothing was known ofher whereabouts, then the pigeons reported that they had seen her on theother side of Willingdon."
13875,6,"She was between the shafts of a smart dogcartpainted red and black, which was standing outside a public-house."
13876,6,"A fatred-faced man in check breeches and gaiters, who looked like a publican,was stroking her nose and feeding her with sugar."
13877,6,Her coat was newlyclipped and she wore a scarlet ribbon round her forelock.
13878,6,"She appeared tobe enjoying herself, so the pigeons said."
13879,6,None of the animals evermentioned Mollie again.In January there came bitterly hard weather.
13880,6,"The earth was like iron, andnothing could be done in the fields."
13881,6,"Many meetings were held in the bigbarn, and the pigs occupied themselves with planning out the work of thecoming season."
13882,6,"It had come to be accepted that the pigs, who weremanifestly cleverer than the other animals, should decide all questions offarm policy, though their decisions had to be ratified by a majority vote.This arrangement would have worked well enough if it had not been for thedisputes between Snowball and Napoleon."
13883,6,These two disagreed at every pointwhere disagreement was possible.
13884,6,"If one of them suggested sowing a biggeracreage with barley, the other was certain to demand a bigger acreage ofoats, and if one of them said that such and such a field was just rightfor cabbages, the other would declare that it was useless for anythingexcept roots."
13885,6,"Each had his own following, and there were some violentdebates."
13886,6,"At the Meetings Snowball often won over the majority by hisbrilliant speeches, but Napoleon was better at canvassing support forhimself in between times."
13887,6,He was especially successful with the sheep.
13888,6,"Oflate the sheep had taken to bleating ""Four legs good, two legs bad"" bothin and out of season, and they often interrupted the Meeting with this."
13889,6,"Itwas noticed that they were especially liable to break into ""Four legsgood, two legs bad"" at crucial moments in Snowball's speeches."
13890,6,"Snowballhad made a close study of some back numbers of the 'Farmer andStockbreeder' which he had found in the farmhouse, and was full of plansfor innovations and improvements."
13891,6,"He talked learnedly about field drains,silage, and basic slag, and had worked out a complicated scheme for allthe animals to drop their dung directly in the fields, at a different spotevery day, to save the labour of cartage."
13892,6,"Napoleon produced no schemes ofhis own, but said quietly that Snowball's would come to nothing, andseemed to be biding his time."
13893,6,"But of all their controversies, none was sobitter as the one that took place over the windmill.In the long pasture, not far from the farm buildings, there was a smallknoll which was the highest point on the farm."
13894,6,"After surveying the ground,Snowball declared that this was just the place for a windmill, which couldbe made to operate a dynamo and supply the farm with electrical power.This would light the stalls and warm them in winter, and would also run acircular saw, a chaff-cutter, a mangel-slicer, and an electric milkingmachine."
13895,6,"The animals had never heard of anything of this kind before(for the farm was an old-fashioned one and had only the most primitivemachinery), and they listened in astonishment while Snowball conjured uppictures of fantastic machines which would do their work for them whilethey grazed at their ease in the fields or improved their minds withreading and conversation.Within a few weeks Snowball's plans for the windmill were fully workedout."
13896,6,The mechanical details came mostly from three books which hadbelonged to Mr.
13897,6,"Jones--'One Thousand Useful Things to Do About the House','Every Man His Own Bricklayer', and 'Electricity for Beginners'."
13898,6,"Snowballused as his study a shed which had once been used for incubators and had asmooth wooden floor, suitable for drawing on."
13899,6,He was closeted there forhours at a time.
13900,6,"With his books held open by a stone, and with a piece ofchalk gripped between the knuckles of his trotter, he would move rapidlyto and fro, drawing in line after line and uttering little whimpers ofexcitement."
13901,6,"Gradually the plans grew into a complicated mass of cranks andcog-wheels, covering more than half the floor, which the other animalsfound completely unintelligible but very impressive."
13902,6,All of them came tolook at Snowball's drawings at least once a day.
13903,6,"Even the hens and duckscame, and were at pains not to tread on the chalk marks."
13904,6,Only Napoleonheld aloof.
13905,6,"He had declared himself against the windmill from the start.One day, however, he arrived unexpectedly to examine the plans."
13906,6,"He walkedheavily round the shed, looked closely at every detail of the plans andsnuffed at them once or twice, then stood for a little while contemplatingthem out of the corner of his eye; then suddenly he lifted his leg,urinated over the plans, and walked out without uttering a word.The whole farm was deeply divided on the subject of the windmill."
13907,6,Snowballdid not deny that to build it would be a difficult business.
13908,6,"Stone wouldhave to be carried and built up into walls, then the sails would have tobe made and after that there would be need for dynamos and cables."
13909,6,"(Howthese were to be procured, Snowball did not say.) But he maintained thatit could all be done in a year."
13910,6,"And thereafter, he declared, so muchlabour would be saved that the animals would only need to work three daysa week."
13911,6,"Napoleon, on the other hand, argued that the great need of themoment was to increase food production, and that if they wasted time onthe windmill they would all starve to death."
13912,6,"The animals formed themselvesinto two factions under the slogan, ""Vote for Snowball and the three-dayweek"" and ""Vote for Napoleon and the full manger."" Benjamin was the onlyanimal who did not side with either faction."
13913,6,He refused to believe eitherthat food would become more plentiful or that the windmill would savework.
13914,6,"Windmill or no windmill, he said, life would go on as it had alwaysgone on--that is, badly.Apart from the disputes over the windmill, there was the question of thedefence of the farm."
13915,6,It was fully realised that though the human beingshad been defeated in the Battle of the Cowshed they might make another andmore determined attempt to recapture the farm and reinstate Mr.
13916,6,Jones.They had all the more reason for doing so because the news of their defeathad spread across the countryside and made the animals on the neighbouringfarms more restive than ever.
13917,6,"As usual, Snowball and Napoleon were indisagreement."
13918,6,"According to Napoleon, what the animals must do was toprocure firearms and train themselves in the use of them."
13919,6,"According toSnowball, they must send out more and more pigeons and stir up rebellionamong the animals on the other farms."
13920,6,"The one argued that if they couldnot defend themselves they were bound to be conquered, the other arguedthat if rebellions happened everywhere they would have no need to defendthemselves."
13921,6,"The animals listened first to Napoleon, then to Snowball, andcould not make up their minds which was right; indeed, they always foundthemselves in agreement with the one who was speaking at the moment.At last the day came when Snowball's plans were completed."
13922,6,At the Meetingon the following Sunday the question of whether or not to begin work onthe windmill was to be put to the vote.
13923,6,"When the animals had assembled inthe big barn, Snowball stood up and, though occasionally interrupted bybleating from the sheep, set forth his reasons for advocating the buildingof the windmill."
13924,6,Then Napoleon stood up to reply.
13925,6,"He said very quietlythat the windmill was nonsense and that he advised nobody to vote for it,and promptly sat down again; he had spoken for barely thirty seconds, andseemed almost indifferent as to the effect he produced."
13926,6,"At this Snowballsprang to his feet, and shouting down the sheep, who had begun bleatingagain, broke into a passionate appeal in favour of the windmill."
13927,6,"Until nowthe animals had been about equally divided in their sympathies, but in amoment Snowball's eloquence had carried them away."
13928,6,In glowing sentences hepainted a picture of Animal Farm as it might be when sordid labour waslifted from the animals' backs.
13929,6,His imagination had now run far beyondchaff-cutters and turnip-slicers.
13930,6,"Electricity, he said, could operatethreshing machines, ploughs, harrows, rollers, and reapers and binders,besides supplying every stall with its own electric light, hot and coldwater, and an electric heater."
13931,6,"By the time he had finished speaking, therewas no doubt as to which way the vote would go."
13932,6,"But just at this momentNapoleon stood up and, casting a peculiar sidelong look at Snowball,uttered a high-pitched whimper of a kind no one had ever heard him utterbefore.At this there was a terrible baying sound outside, and nine enormous dogswearing brass-studded collars came bounding into the barn."
13933,6,"They dashedstraight for Snowball, who only sprang from his place just in time toescape their snapping jaws."
13934,6,In a moment he was out of the door and theywere after him.
13935,6,"Too amazed and frightened to speak, all the animalscrowded through the door to watch the chase."
13936,6,Snowball was racing acrossthe long pasture that led to the road.
13937,6,"He was running as only a pig canrun, but the dogs were close on his heels."
13938,6,Suddenly he slipped and itseemed certain that they had him.
13939,6,"Then he was up again, running fasterthan ever, then the dogs were gaining on him again."
13940,6,"One of them all butclosed his jaws on Snowball's tail, but Snowball whisked it free just intime."
13941,6,"Then he put on an extra spurt and, with a few inches to spare,slipped through a hole in the hedge and was seen no more.Silent and terrified, the animals crept back into the barn."
13942,6,In a momentthe dogs came bounding back.
13943,6,"At first no one had been able to imaginewhere these creatures came from, but the problem was soon solved: theywere the puppies whom Napoleon had taken away from their mothers andreared privately."
13944,6,"Though not yet full-grown, they were huge dogs, and asfierce-looking as wolves."
13945,6,They kept close to Napoleon.
13946,6,It was noticed thatthey wagged their tails to him in the same way as the other dogs had beenused to do to Mr.
13947,6,"Jones.Napoleon, with the dogs following him, now mounted on to the raisedportion of the floor where Major had previously stood to deliver hisspeech."
13948,6,He announced that from now on the Sunday-morning Meetings wouldcome to an end.
13949,6,"They were unnecessary, he said, and wasted time."
13950,6,"In futureall questions relating to the working of the farm would be settled by aspecial committee of pigs, presided over by himself."
13951,6,These would meet inprivate and afterwards communicate their decisions to the others.
13952,6,"Theanimals would still assemble on Sunday mornings to salute the flag, sing'Beasts of England', and receive their orders for the week; but there wouldbe no more debates.In spite of the shock that Snowball's expulsion had given them, theanimals were dismayed by this announcement."
13953,6,Several of them would haveprotested if they could have found the right arguments.
13954,6,Even Boxer wasvaguely troubled.
13955,6,"He set his ears back, shook his forelock several times,and tried hard to marshal his thoughts; but in the end he could not thinkof anything to say."
13956,6,"Some of the pigs themselves, however, were morearticulate."
13957,6,"Four young porkers in the front row uttered shrill squeals ofdisapproval, and all four of them sprang to their feet and began speakingat once."
13958,6,"But suddenly the dogs sitting round Napoleon let out deep,menacing growls, and the pigs fell silent and sat down again."
13959,6,"Then thesheep broke out into a tremendous bleating of ""Four legs good, two legsbad!"" which went on for nearly a quarter of an hour and put an end to anychance of discussion.Afterwards Squealer was sent round the farm to explain the new arrangementto the others.""Comrades,"" he said, ""I trust that every animal here appreciates thesacrifice that Comrade Napoleon has made in taking this extra labour uponhimself."
13960,6,"Do not imagine, comrades, that leadership is a pleasure! On thecontrary, it is a deep and heavy responsibility."
13961,6,No one believes morefirmly than Comrade Napoleon that all animals are equal.
13962,6,He would be onlytoo happy to let you make your decisions for yourselves.
13963,6,"But sometimes youmight make the wrong decisions, comrades, and then where should we be?Suppose you had decided to follow Snowball, with his moonshine ofwindmills--Snowball, who, as we now know, was no better than a criminal?""""He fought bravely at the Battle of the Cowshed,"" said somebody.""Bravery is not enough,"" said Squealer."
13964,6,"""Loyalty and obedience are moreimportant."
13965,6,"And as to the Battle of the Cowshed, I believe the time willcome when we shall find that Snowball's part in it was much exaggerated.Discipline, comrades, iron discipline! That is the watchword for today.One false step, and our enemies would be upon us."
13966,6,"Surely, comrades, you donot want Jones back?""Once again this argument was unanswerable."
13967,6,"Certainly the animals did notwant Jones back; if the holding of debates on Sunday mornings was liableto bring him back, then the debates must stop."
13968,6,"Boxer, who had now had timeto think things over, voiced the general feeling by saying: ""If ComradeNapoleon says it, it must be right."" And from then on he adopted themaxim, ""Napoleon is always right,"" in addition to his private motto of ""Iwill work harder.""By this time the weather had broken and the spring ploughing had begun.The shed where Snowball had drawn his plans of the windmill had been shutup and it was assumed that the plans had been rubbed off the floor."
13969,6,EverySunday morning at ten o'clock the animals assembled in the big barn toreceive their orders for the week.
13970,6,"The skull of old Major, now clean offlesh, had been disinterred from the orchard and set up on a stump at thefoot of the flagstaff, beside the gun."
13971,6,"After the hoisting of the flag, theanimals were required to file past the skull in a reverent manner beforeentering the barn."
13972,6,Nowadays they did not sit all together as they had donein the past.
13973,6,"Napoleon, with Squealer and another pig named Minimus, whohad a remarkable gift for composing songs and poems, sat on the front ofthe raised platform, with the nine young dogs forming a semicircle roundthem, and the other pigs sitting behind."
13974,6,The rest of the animals satfacing them in the main body of the barn.
13975,6,"Napoleon read out the orders forthe week in a gruff soldierly style, and after a single singing of 'Beastsof England', all the animals dispersed.On the third Sunday after Snowball's expulsion, the animals were somewhatsurprised to hear Napoleon announce that the windmill was to be builtafter all."
13976,6,"He did not give any reason for having changed his mind, butmerely warned the animals that this extra task would mean very hard work,it might even be necessary to reduce their rations."
13977,6,"The plans, however,had all been prepared, down to the last detail."
13978,6,A special committee ofpigs had been at work upon them for the past three weeks.
13979,6,"The building ofthe windmill, with various other improvements, was expected to take twoyears.That evening Squealer explained privately to the other animals thatNapoleon had never in reality been opposed to the windmill."
13980,6,"On thecontrary, it was he who had advocated it in the beginning, and the planwhich Snowball had drawn on the floor of the incubator shed had actuallybeen stolen from among Napoleon's papers."
13981,6,"The windmill was, in fact,Napoleon's own creation."
13982,6,"Why, then, asked somebody, had he spoken sostrongly against it? Here Squealer looked very sly."
13983,6,"That, he said, wasComrade Napoleon's cunning."
13984,6,"He had SEEMED to oppose the windmill, simplyas a manoeuvre to get rid of Snowball, who was a dangerous character and abad influence."
13985,6,"Now that Snowball was out of the way, the plan could goforward without his interference."
13986,6,"This, said Squealer, was somethingcalled tactics."
13987,6,"He repeated a number of times, ""Tactics, comrades,tactics!"" skipping round and whisking his tail with a merry laugh."
13988,6,"Theanimals were not certain what the word meant, but Squealer spoke sopersuasively, and the three dogs who happened to be with him growled sothreateningly, that they accepted his explanation without furtherquestions.Chapter VIAll that year the animals worked like slaves."
13989,6,"But they were happy in theirwork; they grudged no effort or sacrifice, well aware that everything thatthey did was for the benefit of themselves and those of their kind whowould come after them, and not for a pack of idle, thieving human beings.Throughout the spring and summer they worked a sixty-hour week, and inAugust Napoleon announced that there would be work on Sunday afternoonsas well."
13990,6,"This work was strictly voluntary, but any animal who absentedhimself from it would have his rations reduced by half."
13991,6,"Even so, it wasfound necessary to leave certain tasks undone."
13992,6,"The harvest was a littleless successful than in the previous year, and two fields which shouldhave been sown with roots in the early summer were not sown because theploughing had not been completed early enough."
13993,6,It was possible to foreseethat the coming winter would be a hard one.The windmill presented unexpected difficulties.
13994,6,"There was a good quarry oflimestone on the farm, and plenty of sand and cement had been found in oneof the outhouses, so that all the materials for building were at hand."
13995,6,Butthe problem the animals could not at first solve was how to break up thestone into pieces of suitable size.
13996,6,"There seemed no way of doing thisexcept with picks and crowbars, which no animal could use, because noanimal could stand on his hind legs."
13997,6,"Only after weeks of vain effort didthe right idea occur to somebody-namely, to utilise the force of gravity.Huge boulders, far too big to be used as they were, were lying all overthe bed of the quarry."
13998,6,"The animals lashed ropes round these, and then alltogether, cows, horses, sheep, any animal that could lay hold of therope--even the pigs sometimes joined in at critical moments--they draggedthem with desperate slowness up the slope to the top of the quarry, wherethey were toppled over the edge, to shatter to pieces below."
13999,6,Transportingthe stone when it was once broken was comparatively simple.
14000,6,"The horsescarried it off in cart-loads, the sheep dragged single blocks, even Murieland Benjamin yoked themselves into an old governess-cart and did theirshare."
14001,6,"By late summer a sufficient store of stone had accumulated, andthen the building began, under the superintendence of the pigs.But it was a slow, laborious process."
14002,6,"Frequently it took a whole day ofexhausting effort to drag a single boulder to the top of the quarry, andsometimes when it was pushed over the edge it failed to break."
14003,6,"Nothingcould have been achieved without Boxer, whose strength seemed equal tothat of all the rest of the animals put together."
14004,6,"When the boulder beganto slip and the animals cried out in despair at finding themselves draggeddown the hill, it was always Boxer who strained himself against the ropeand brought the boulder to a stop."
14005,6,"To see him toiling up the slope inch byinch, his breath coming fast, the tips of his hoofs clawing at the ground,and his great sides matted with sweat, filled everyone with admiration.Clover warned him sometimes to be careful not to overstrain himself, butBoxer would never listen to her."
14006,6,"His two slogans, ""I will work harder""and ""Napoleon is always right,"" seemed to him a sufficient answer to allproblems."
14007,6,"He had made arrangements with the cockerel to call himthree-quarters of an hour earlier in the mornings instead of half an hour.And in his spare moments, of which there were not many nowadays, he wouldgo alone to the quarry, collect a load of broken stone, and drag it downto the site of the windmill unassisted.The animals were not badly off throughout that summer, in spite of thehardness of their work."
14008,6,"If they had no more food than they had had inJones's day, at least they did not have less."
14009,6,"The advantage of only havingto feed themselves, and not having to support five extravagant humanbeings as well, was so great that it would have taken a lot of failures tooutweigh it."
14010,6,And in many ways the animal method of doing things was moreefficient and saved labour.
14011,6,"Such jobs as weeding, for instance, could bedone with a thoroughness impossible to human beings."
14012,6,"And again, since noanimal now stole, it was unnecessary to fence off pasture from arableland, which saved a lot of labour on the upkeep of hedges and gates.Nevertheless, as the summer wore on, various unforeseen shortages began tomake them selves felt."
14013,6,"There was need of paraffin oil, nails, string, dogbiscuits, and iron for the horses' shoes, none of which could be producedon the farm."
14014,6,"Later there would also be need for seeds and artificialmanures, besides various tools and, finally, the machinery for thewindmill."
14015,6,"How these were to be procured, no one was able to imagine.One Sunday morning, when the animals assembled to receive their orders,Napoleon announced that he had decided upon a new policy."
14016,6,"From now onwardsAnimal Farm would engage in trade with the neighbouring farms: not, ofcourse, for any commercial purpose, but simply in order to obtain certainmaterials which were urgently necessary."
14017,6,"The needs of the windmill mustoverride everything else, he said."
14018,6,"He was therefore making arrangements tosell a stack of hay and part of the current year's wheat crop, and lateron, if more money were needed, it would have to be made up by the sale ofeggs, for which there was always a market in Willingdon."
14019,6,"The hens, saidNapoleon, should welcome this sacrifice as their own special contributiontowards the building of the windmill.Once again the animals were conscious of a vague uneasiness."
14020,6,"Never to haveany dealings with human beings, never to engage in trade, never to makeuse of money--had not these been among the earliest resolutions passed atthat first triumphant Meeting after Jones was expelled? All the animalsremembered passing such resolutions: or at least they thought that theyremembered it."
14021,6,The four young pigs who had protested when Napoleonab.
14022,7,I first met Dean not long after my wife and I split up.
14023,7,"I had just gotten over a serious illness that Iwon’t bother to talk about, except that it had something to do with the miserably weary split-up andmy feeling that everything was dead."
14024,7,With the coming of Dean Moriarty began the part of my life youcould call my life on the road.
14025,7,"Before that I’d often dreamed of going West to see the country,always vaguely planning and never taking off."
14026,7,"Dean is the perfect guy for the road because heactually was born on the road, when his parents were passing through Salt Lake City in 1926, in ajalopy, on their way to Los Angeles."
14027,7,"First reports of him came to me through Chad King, who’dshown me a few letters from him written in a New Mexico reform school."
14028,7,I was tremendouslyinterested in the letters because they so naively and sweetly asked Chad to teach him all aboutNietzsche and all the wonderful intellectual things that Chad knew.
14029,7,At one point Carlo and I talkedabout the letters and wondered if we would ever meet the strange Dean Moriarty.
14030,7,"This is all farback, when Dean was not the way he is today, when he was a young jailkid shrouded in mystery.Then news came that Dean was out of reform school and was coming to New York for the firsttime; also there was talk that he had just married a girl called Marylou.One day I was hanging around the campus and Chad and Tim Gray told me Dean was staying ina cold-water pad in East Harlem, the Spanish Harlem."
14031,7,"Dean had arrived the night before, the firsttime in New York, with his beautiful little sharp chick Marylou; they got off the Greyhound bus at50th Street and cut around the corner looking for a place to eat and went right in Hector’s, and sincethen Hector’s cafeteria has always been a big symbol of New York for Dean."
14032,7,"They spent money onbeautiful big glazed cakes and creampuffs.All this time Dean was telling Marylou things like this: «Now, darling, here we are in New Yorkand although I haven’t quite told you everything that I was thinking about when we crossed Missouriand especially at the point when we passed the Booneville reformatory which reminded me of my jailproblem, it is absolutely necessary now to postpone all those leftover things concerning our personallovethings and at once begin thinking of specific worklife plans ."
14033,7,.
14034,7,".» and so on in the way that he hadin those early days.I went to the cold-water flat with the boys, and Dean came to the door in his shorts."
14035,7,"Marylou wasjumping off the couch; Dean had dispatched the occupant of the apartment to the kitchen, probablyto make coffee, while he proceeded with his loveproblems, for to him sex was the one and only holyand important thing in life, although he had to sweat and curse to make a living and so on."
14036,7,"You sawthat in the way he stood bobbing his head, always looking down, nodding, like a young boxer toinstructions, to make you think he was listening to every word, throwing in a thousand «Yeses» and«That’s rights.» My first impression of Dean was of a young Gene Autry - trim, thin-hipped, blue-eyed, with a real Oklahoma accent - a sideburned hero of the snowy West."
14037,7,"In fact he’d just beenworking on a ranch, Ed Wall’s in Colorado, before marrying Marylou and coming East."
14038,7,"Marylouwas a pretty blonde with immense ringlets of hair like a sea of golden tresses; she sat there on theedge of the couch with her hands hanging in her lap and her smoky blue country eyes fixed in a widestare because she was in an evil gray New York pad that she’d heard about back West, and waitinglike a longbodied emaciated Modigliani surrealist woman in a serious room."
14039,7,"But, outside of being asweet little girl, she was awfully dumb and capable of doing horrible things."
14040,7,"That night we all drankbeer and pulled wrists and talked till dawn, and in the morning, while we sat around dumbly smokingbutts from ashtrays in the gray light of a gloomy day, Dean got up nervously, paced around, thinking,and decided the thing to do was to have Marylou make breakfast and sweep the floor."
14041,7,"«In other5words we’ve got to get on the ball, darling, what I’m saying, otherwise it’ll be fluctuating and lack oftrue knowledge or crystallization of our plans.» Then I went away.During the following week he confided in Chad King that he absolutely had to learn how to writefrom him; Chad said I was a writer and he should come to me for advice."
14042,7,"Meanwhile Dean hadgotten a job in a parking lot, had a fight with Marylou in their Hoboken apartment - God knows whythey went there - and she was so mad and so down deep vindictive that she reported to the policesome false trumped-up hysterical crazy charge, and Dean had to lam from Hoboken."
14043,7,So he had noplace to live.
14044,7,"He came right out to Paterson, New Jersey, where I was living with my aunt, and onenight while I was studying there was a knock on the door, and there was Dean, bowing, shufflingobsequiously in the dark of the hall, and saying, «Hello, you remember me - Dean Moriarty? I’vecome to ask you to show me how to write.»«And where’s Marylou?» I asked, and Dean said she’d apparently whored a few dollars togetherand gone back to Denver - »the whore!» So we went out to have a few beers because we couldn’ttalk like we wanted to talk in front of my aunt, who sat in the living room reading her paper."
14045,7,"Shetook one look at Dean and decided that he was a madman.In the bar I told Dean, «Hell, man, I know very well you didn’t come to me only to want tobecome a writer, and after all what do I really know about it except you’ve got to stick to it with theenergy of a benny addict.» And he said, «Yes, of course, I know exactly what you mean and in factall those problems have occurred to me, but the thing that I want is the realization of those factorsthat should one depend on Schopenhauer’s dichotomy for any inwardly realized ."
14046,7,.
14047,7,".» and so on inthat way, things I understood not a bit and he himself didn’t."
14048,7,"In those days he really didn’t knowwhat he was talking about; that is to say, he was a young jailkid all hung-up on the wonderfulpossibilities of becoming a real intellectual, and he liked to talk in the tone and using the words, but ina jumbled way, that he had heard from «real intellectuals» - although, mind you, he wasn’t so naiveas that in all other things, and it took him just a few months with Carlo Marx to become completelyin there with all the terms and jargon."
14049,7,"Nonetheless we understood each other on other levels ofmadness, and I agreed that he could stay at my house till he found a job and furthermore we agreedto go out West sometime."
14050,7,"That was the winter of 1947.One night when Dean ate supper at my house - he already had the parking-lot job in New York -he leaned over my shoulder as I typed rapidly away and said, «Come on man, those girls won’t wait,make it fast.»I said, «Hold on just a minute, I’ll be right with you soon as I finish this chapter,» and it was oneof the best chapters in the book."
14051,7,"Then I dressed and off we flew to New York to meet some girls.As we rode in the bus in the weird phosphorescent void of the Lincoln Tunnel we leaned on eachother with fingers waving and yelled and talked excitedly, and I was beginning to get the bug likeDean."
14052,7,"He was simply a youth tremendously excited with life, and though he was a con-man, he wasonly conning because he wanted so much to live and to get involved with people who wouldotherwise pay no attention to him."
14053,7,"He was conning me and I knew it (for room and board and «how-to-write,» etc.), and he knew I knew (this has been the basis of our relationship), but I didn’t careand we got along fine - no pestering, no catering; we tiptoed around each other like heartbreakingnew friends."
14054,7,I began to learn from him as much as he probably learned from me.
14055,7,"As far as my workwas concerned he said, «Go ahead, everything you do is great.» He watched over my shoulder as Iwrote stories, yelling, «Yes! That’s right! Wow! Man!» and «Phew!» and wiped his face with hishandkerchief."
14056,7,"«Man, wow, there’s so many things to do, so many things to write! How to evenbegin to get it all down and without modified restraints and all hung-up on like literary inhibitions andgrammatical fears ."
14057,7,.
14058,7,".»6«That’s right, man, now you’re talking.» And a kind of holy lightning I saw flashing from hisexcitement and his visions, which he described so torrentially that people in buses looked around tosee the «overexcited nut.» In the West he’d spent a third of his time in the poolhall, a third in jail, anda third in the public library."
14059,7,"They’d seen him rushing eagerly down the winter streets, bareheaded,carrying books to the poolhall, or climbing trees to get into the attics of buddies where he spent daysreading or hiding from the law.We went to New York - I forget what the situation was, two colored girls - there were no girlsthere; they were supposed to meet him in a diner and didn’t show up."
14060,7,"We went to his parking lotwhere he had a few things to do - change his clothes in the shack in back and spruce up a bit in frontof a cracked mirror and so on, and then we took off."
14061,7,And that was the night Dean met Carlo Marx.A tremendous thing happened when Dean met Carlo Marx.
14062,7,"Two keen minds that they are, they tookto each other at the drop of a hat."
14063,7,"Two piercing eyes glanced into two piercing eyes - the holy con-man with the shining mind, and the sorrowful poetic con-man with the dark mind that is Carlo Marx.From that moment on I saw very little of Dean, and I was a little sorry too."
14064,7,"Their energies met head-on, I was a lout compared, I couldn’t keep up with them.The whole mad swirl of everything that was to come began then; it would mix up all my friendsand all I had left of my family in a big dust cloud over the American Night."
14065,7,"Carlo told him of Old BullLee, Elmer Hassel, Jane: Lee in Texas growing weed, Hassel on Riker’s Island, Jane wandering onTimes Square in a benzedrine hallucination, with her baby girl in her arms and ending up in Bellevue.And Dean told Carlo of unknown people in the West like Tommy Snark, the clubfooted poolhallrotation shark and cardplayer and queer saint."
14066,7,"He told him of Roy Johnson, Big Ed Dunkel, hisboyhood buddies, his street buddies, his innumerable girls and sex-parties and pornographicpictures, his heroes, heroines, adventures."
14067,7,"They rushed down the street together, digging everythingin the early way they had, which later became so much sadder and perceptive and blank."
14068,7,"But thenthey danced down the streets like dingledodies, and I shambled after as I’ve been doing all my lifeafter people who interest me, because the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who aremad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones whonever yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candlesexploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop andeverybody goes «Awww!» What did they call such young people in Goethe’s Germany? Wantingdearly to learn how to write like Carlo, the first thing you know, Dean was attacking him with a greatamorous soul such as only a con-man can have."
14069,7,"«Now, Carlo, let me speak - here’s what I’msaying ...» I didn’t see them for about two weeks, during which time they cemented their relationshipto fiendish allday-allnight-talk proportions.Then came spring, the great time of traveling, and everybody in the scattered gang was getting ready to take one trip or another."
14070,7,"I was busily at work on my novel and when I carne to the halfway mark, after a trip down South with my aunt to visit my brother Rocco, I got ready to travel West for the very first time.Dean had already left."
14071,7,Carlo and I saw him off at the 34th Street Greyhound station.
14072,7,Upstairs they had a place where you could make pictures for a quarter.
14073,7,Carlo took off his glasses and looked sinister.
14074,7,Dean made a profile shot and looked coyly around.
14075,7,I took a straight picture that made me look like a thirty-year-old Italian who’d kill anybody who said anything against his mother.
14076,7,This picture Carlo and Dean neatly cut down the middle with a razor and saved a half each in theirwallets.
14077,7,Dean was wearing a real Western business suit for his big trip back to Denver; he’d finished his first fling in New York.
14078,7,"I say fling, but he only worked like a dog in parking lots."
14079,7,"The most fantastic parking-lot attendant in the world, he can back a car forty miles an hour into a tight squeeze and stop at the wall, jump out, race among fenders, leap into another car, circle it fifty miles an hour in a narrow space, back swiftly into tight spot, hump, snap the car with the emergency so that you see it bounce as he flies out; then clear to the ticket shack, sprinting like a track star, hand a ticket, leap into a newly arrived car before the owner’s half out, leap literally under him as he steps out, start the car with the door flapping, and roar off to the next available spot, arc, pop in, brake, out, run; working like that without pause eight hours a night, evening rush hours and after-theater rush hours, in greasy wino pants with a frayed fur-lined jacket and beat shoes that flap."
14080,7,"Now he’d bought a newsuit to go back in; blue with pencil stripes, vest and all - eleven dollars on Third Avenue, with a watch and watch chain, and a portable typewriter with which he was going to start writing in a Denver rooming house as soon as he got a job there."
14081,7,"We had a farewell meal of franks and beans in a Seventh Avenue Riker’s, and then Dean got on the bus that said Chicago and roared off into the night."
14082,7,There went our wrangler.
14083,7,I promised myself to go the same way when spring really bloomed and opened up the land.
14084,7,"  And this was really the way that my whole road experience began, and the things that were tocome are too fantastic not to tell.Yes, and it wasn’t only because I was a writer and needed new experiences that I wanted toknow Dean more, and because my life hanging around the campus had reached the completion of itscycle and was stultified, but because, somehow, in spite of our difference in character, he remindedme of some long-lost brother; the sight of his suffering bony face with the long sideburns and hisstraining muscular sweating neck made me remember my boyhood in those dye-dumps and swim-holes and riversides of Paterson and the Passaic."
14085,7,"His dirty workclothes clung to him so gracefully, asthough you couldn’t buy a better fit from a custom tailor but only earn it from the Natural Tailor ofNatural Joy, as Dean had, in his stresses."
14086,7,"And in his excited way of speaking I heard again the voicesof old companions and brothers under the bridge, among the motorcycles, along the wash-linedneighborhood and drowsy doorsteps of afternoon where boys played guitars while their olderbrothers worked in the mills."
14087,7,"All my other current friends were «intellectuals» - Chad the Nietzscheananthropologist, Carlo Marx and his nutty surrealist low-voiced serious staring talk, Old Bull Lee andhis critical anti-every-thing drawl - or else they were slinking criminals like Elmer Hassel, with that hipsneer; Jane Lee the same, sprawled on the Oriental cover of her couch, sniffing at the New Yorker.But Dean’s intelligence was every bit as formal and shining and complete, without the tediousintellectualness."
14088,7,"And his «criminality» was not something that sulked and sneered; it was a wild yea-saying overburst of American joy; it was Western, the west wind, an ode from the Plains, somethingnew, long prophesied, long a-coming (he only stole cars for joy rides)."
14089,7,"Besides, all my New Yorkfriends were in the negative, nightmare position of putting down society and giving their tired bookishor political or psychoanalytical reasons, but Dean just raced in society, eager for bread and love; hedidn’t care one way or the other, «so long’s I can get that lil ole gal with that lil sumpin down theretween her legs, boy,» and «so long’s we can eat, son, y’ear me? I’m hungry, I’m starving, let’s eatright now!» - and off we’d rush to eat, whereof, as saith Ecclesiastes, «It is your portion under thesun.»A western kinsman of the sun, Dean."
14090,7,"Although my aunt warned me that he would get me introuble, I could hear a new call and see a new horizon, and believe it at my young age; and a little bitof trouble or even Dean’s eventual rejection of me as a buddy, putting me down, as he would later,on starving sidewalks and sickbeds - what did it matter? I was a young writer and I wanted to takeoff.Somewhere along the line I knew there’d be girls, visions, everything; somewhere along the line   8the pearl would be handed to me.  9 2In the month of July 1947, having saved about fifty dollars from old veteran benefits, I was ready to go to the West Coast."
14091,7,"My friend Remi Boncœur had written me a letter from San Francisco, saying I should come and ship out with him on an around-the-world liner."
14092,7,He swore he could get me into the engine room.
14093,7,I wrote back and said I’d be satisfied with any old freighter so long as I could take a few long Pacific trips and come back with enough money to support myself in my aunt’s house while I finished my book.
14094,7,He said he had a shack in Mill City and I would have all the time in the world to write there while we went through the rigmarole of getting the ship.
14095,7,He was living with a girl called Lee Ann; he said she was a marvelous cook and everything would jump.
14096,7,"Remi was an old prep-school friend, a Frenchman brought up in Paris and a really mad guy - I didn’t know how mad at this time."
14097,7,So he expected me to arrive in ten days.
14098,7,"My aunt was all in accord with my trip to the West; she said it would do me good, I’d been working so hard all winter and staying in too much; she even didn’t complain when I told her I’d have to hitchhike some."
14099,7,All she wanted was for me to come back in one piece.
14100,7,"So, leaving my big half-manuscript sitting on top of my desk, and folding back my comfortable home sheets for the last time one morning, I left with my canvas bag in which a few fundamental things were packed and took off for the Pacific Ocean with the fifty dollars in my pocket.I’d been poring over maps of the United States in Paterson for months, even reading books aboutthe pioneers and savoring names like Platte and Cimarron and so on, and on the road-map was onelong red line called Route 6 that led from the tip of Cape Cod clear to Ely, Nevada, and theredipped down to Los Angeles."
14101,7,"I’ll just stay on 6 all the way to Ely, I said to myself and confidentlystarted."
14102,7,To get to 6 I had to go up to Bear Mountain.
14103,7,"Filled with dreams of what I’d do in Chicago,in Denver, and then finally in San Fran, I took the Seventh Avenue subway to the end of the line at242nd Street, and there took a trolley into Yonkers; in downtown Yonkers I transferred to anoutgoing trolley and went to the city limits on the east bank of the Hudson River."
14104,7,"If you drop a rosein the Hudson River at its mysterious source in the Adirondacks, think of all the places it journeys byas it goes out to sea forever - think of that wonderful Hudson Valley."
14105,7,"I started hitching up the thing.Five scattered rides took me to the desired Bear Mountain Fridge, where Route 6 arched in fromNew England."
14106,7,It began to rain in torrents when I was let off there.
14107,7,It was mountainous.
14108,7,"Route 6came over the river, wound around a traffic circle, and disappeared into the wilderness."
14109,7,Not onlywas there no traffic but the rain came down in buckets and I had no shelter.
14110,7,I had to run under somepines to take cover; this did no good; I began crying and swearing and socking myself on the headfor being such a damn fool.
14111,7,"I was forty miles north of New York; all the way up I’d been worriedabout the fact that on this, my big opening day, I was only moving north instead of the so-longed-forwest."
14112,7,Now I was stuck on my northernmost hangup.
14113,7,I ran a quarter-mile to an abandoned cuteEnglish-style filling station and stood under the dripping eaves.
14114,7,High up over my head the great hairyBear Mountain sent down thunderclaps that put the fear of God in me.
14115,7,All I could see were smokytrees and dismal wilderness rising to the skies.
14116,7,"«What the hell am I doing up here?»I cursed, I cried for Chicago."
14117,7,"«Even now they’re all having a big time, they’re doing this, I’m notthere, when will I get there!» - and so on."
14118,7,Finally a car stopped at the empty filling station; the manand the two women in it wanted to study a map.
14119,7,"I stepped right up and gestured in the rain; theyconsulted; I looked like a maniac, of course, with my hair all wet, my shoes sopping."
14120,7,"My shoes,damn fool that I am, were Mexican huaraches, plantlike sieves not fit for the rainy night of Americaand the raw road night."
14121,7,"But the people let me in and rode me north to Newburgh, which I accepted10as a better alternative than being trapped in the Bear Mountain wilderness all night."
14122,7,"«Besides,» saidthe man, «there’s no traffic passes through 6."
14123,7,"If you want to go to Chicago you’d do better goingacross the Holland Tunnel in New York and head for Pittsburgh,» and I knew he was right."
14124,7,"It wasmy dream that screwed up, the stupid hearthside idea that it would be wonderful to follow one greatred line across America instead of trying various roads and routes."
14125,7,  In Newburgh it had stopped raining.
14126,7,"I walked down to the river, and I had to ride back to NewYork in a bus with a delegation of schoolteachers coming back from a weekend in the mountains -chatter-chatter blah-blah, and me swearing for all the time and the money I’d wasted, and tellingmyself, I wanted to go west and here I’ve been all day and into the night going up and down, northand south, like something that can’t get started."
14127,7,"And I swore I’d be in Chicago tomorrow, and madesure of that, taking a bus to Chicago, spending most of my money, and didn’t give a damn, just aslong as I’d be in Chicago tomorrow.   11   3It was an ordinary bus trip with crying babies and hot sun, and countryfolk getting on at one Penntown after another, till we got on the plain of Ohio and really rolled, up by Ashtabula and straightacross Indiana in the night."
14128,7,"I arrived in Chi quite early in the morning, got a room in the Y, and wentto bed with a very few dollars in my pocket."
14129,7,"I dug Chicago after a good day’s sleep.The wind from Lake Michigan, bop at the Loop, long walks around South Halsted and NorthClark, and one long walk after midnight into the jungles, where a cruising car followed me as asuspicious character."
14130,7,"At this time, 1947, bop was going like mad all over America."
14131,7,"The fellows at theLoop blew, but with a tired air, because bop was somewhere between its Charlie ParkerOrnithology period and another period that began with Miles Davis."
14132,7,"And as I sat there listening tothat sound of the .light which bop has come to represent for all of us, I thought of all my friends fromone end of the country to the other and how they were really all in the same vast backyard doingsomething so frantic and rushing-about."
14133,7,"And for the first time in my life, the following afternoon, Iwent into the West."
14134,7,It was a warm and beautiful day for hitchhiking.
14135,7,"To get out of the impossiblecomplexities of Chicago traffic I took a bus to Joliet, Illinois, went by the Joliet pen, stationed myselfjust outside town after a walk through its leafy rickety streets behind, and pointed my way."
14136,7,"All theway from New York to Joliet by bus, and I had spent more than half my money.My first ride was a dynamite truck with a red flag, about thirty miles into great green Illinois, thetruckdriver pointing out the place where Route 6, which we were on, intersects Route 66 before theyboth shoot west for incredible distances."
14137,7,"Along about three in the afternoon, after an apple pie andice cream in a roadside stand, a woman stopped for me in a little coupe."
14138,7,I had a twinge of hard joyas I ran after the car.
14139,7,"But she was a middle-aged woman, actually the mother of sons my age, andwanted somebody to help her drive to Iowa."
14140,7,I was all for it.
14141,7,"Iowa! Not so far from Denver, andonce I got to Denver I could relax."
14142,7,"She drove the first few hours, at one point insisted on visiting anold church somewhere, as if we were tourists, and then I took over the wheel and, though I’m notmuch of a driver, drove clear through the rest of Illinois to Davenport, Iowa, via Rock Island."
14143,7,"Andhere for the first time in my life I saw my beloved Mississippi River, dry in the summer haze, lowwater, with its big rank smell that smells like the raw body of America itself because it washes it up.Rock Island - railroad tracks, shacks, small downtown section; and over the bridge to Davenport,same kind of town, all smelling of sawdust in the warm midwest sun."
14144,7,"Here the lady had to go on toher Iowa hometown by another route, and I got out.The sun was going down."
14145,7,"I walked, after a few cold beers, to the edge of town, and it was a longwalk."
14146,7,"All the men were driving home from work, wearing railroad hats, baseball hats, all kinds ofhats, just like after work in any town anywhere."
14147,7,One of them gave me a ride up the hill and left me ata lonely crossroads on the edge of the prairie.
14148,7,It was beautiful there.
14149,7,"The only cars that came bywere farmer-cars; they gave me suspicious looks, they clanked along, the cows were coming home.Not a truck."
14150,7,A few cars zipped by.
14151,7,A hotrod kid came by with his scarf flying.
14152,7,The sun went all theway down and I was standing in the purple darkness.
14153,7,Now I was scared.
14154,7,There weren’t even anylights in the Iowa countryside; in a minute nobody would be able to see me.
14155,7,Luckily a man goingback to Davenport gave me a lift downtown.
14156,7,But I was right where I started from.I went to sit in the bus station and think this over.
14157,7,"I ate another apple pie and ice cream; that’spractically all I ate all the way across the country, I knew it was nutritious and it was delicious, ofcourse."
14158,7,I decided to gamble.
14159,7,"I took a bus in downtown Davenport, after spending a half-hourwatching a waitress in the bus-station cafe, and rode to the city limits, but this time near the gas  12stations."
14160,7,"Here the big trucks roared, wham, and inside two minutes one of them cranked to a stopfor me."
14161,7,I ran for it with my soul whoopeeing.
14162,7,And what a driver - a great big tough truckdriver withpopping eyes and a hoarse raspy voice who just slammed and kicked at everything and got his rigunder way and paid hardly any attention to me.
14163,7,"So I could rest my tired soul a little, for one of thebiggest troubles hitchhiking is having to talk to innumerable people, make them feel that they didn’tmake a mistake picking you up, even entertain them almost, all of which is a great strain when you’regoing all the way and don’t plan to sleep in hotels."
14164,7,"The guy just yelled above the roar, and all I had todo was yell back, and we relaxed."
14165,7,"And he balled that thing clear to Iowa City and yelled me thefunniest stories about how he got around the law in every town that had an unfair speed limit, sayingover and over again, «Them goddam cops can’t put no flies on my ass!» Just as we rolled into IowaQty he saw another truck coming behind us, and because he had to turn off at Iowa City he blinkedhis tail lights at the other guy and slowed down for me to jump out, which I did with my bag, and theother truck, acknowledging this exchange, stopped for me, and once again, in the twink of nothing, Iwas in another big high cab, all set to go hundreds of miles across the night, and was I happy! Andthe new truckdriver was as crazy as the other and yelled just as much, and all I had to do was leanback and roll on."
14166,7,"Now I could see Denver looming ahead of me like the Promised Land, way outthere beneath the stars, across the prairie of Iowa and the plains of Nebraska, and I could see thegreater vision of San Francisco beyond, like jewels in the night."
14167,7,"He balled the jack and told storiesfor a couple of hours, then, at a town in Iowa where years later Dean and I were stopped onsuspicion in what looked like a stolen Cadillac, he slept a few hours in the seat."
14168,7,"I slept too, and tookone little walk along the lonely brick walls illuminated by one lamp, with the prairie brooding at theend of each little street and the smell of the corn like dew in the night.He woke up with a start at dawn."
14169,7,"Off we roared, and an hour later the smoke of Des Moinesappeared ahead over the green cornfields."
14170,7,"He had to eat his breakfast now and wanted to take iteasy, so I went right on into Des Moines, about four miles, hitching a ride with two boys from theUniversity of Iowa; and it was strange sitting in their brand-new comfortable car and hearing themtalk of exams as we zoomed smoothly into town."
14171,7,Now I wanted to sleep a whole day.
14172,7,"So I went tothe Y to get a room; they didn’t have any, and by instinct I wandered down to the railroad tracks -and there’re a lot of them in Des Moines - and wound up in a gloomy old Plains inn of a hotel by thelocomotive roundhouse, and spent a long day sleeping on a big clean hard white bed with dirtyremarks carved in the wall beside my pillow and the beat yellow windowshades pulled over thesmoky scene of the rail-yards."
14173,7,"I woke up as the sun was reddening; and that was the one distincttime in my life, the strangest moment of all, when I didn’t know who I was - I was far away fromhome, haunted and tired with travel, in a cheap hotel room I’d never seen, hearing the hiss of steamoutside, and the creak of the old wood of the hotel, and footsteps upstairs, and all the sad sounds,and I looked at the cracked high ceiling and really didn’t know who I was for about fifteen strangeseconds."
14174,7,"I wasn’t scared; I was just somebody else, some stranger, and my whole life was a hauntedlife, the life of a ghost."
14175,7,"I was halfway across America, at the dividing line between the East of myyouth and the West of my future, and maybe that’s why it happened right there and then, that strangered afternoon.But I had to get going and stop moaning, so I picked up my bag, said so long to the oldhotelkeeper sitting by his spittoon, and went to eat."
14176,7,"I ate apple pie and ice cream - it was gettingbetter as I got deeper into Iowa, the pie bigger, the ice cream richer."
14177,7,"There were the most beautifulbevies of girls everywhere I looked in Des Moines that afternoon - they were coming home fromhigh school - but I had no time now for thoughts like that and promised myself a ball in Denver.Carlo Marx was already in Denver; Dean was there; Chad King and Tim Gray were there, it was   13their hometown; Marylou was there; and there was mention of a mighty gang including Ray Rawlinsand his beautiful blond sister Babe Rawlins; two waitresses Dean knew, the Bettencourt sisters; andeven Roland Major, my old college writing buddy, was there."
14178,7,I looked forward to all of them withjoy and anticipation.
14179,7,"So I rushed .past the pretty girls, and the prettiest girls in the world live in DesMoines.A guy with a kind of toolshack on wheels, a truck full of tools that he drove standing up like amodern milkman, gave me a ride up the long hill, where I immediately got a ride from a farmer andhis son heading out for Adel in Iowa."
14180,7,"In this town, under a big elm tree near a gas station, I made theacquaintance of another hitchhiker, a typical New Yorker, an Irishman who’d been driving a truckfor the post office most of his work years and was now headed for a girl in Denver and a new life."
14181,7,"Ithink he was running away from something in New York, the law most likely."
14182,7,"He was a real red-nose young drunk of thirty and would have bored me ordinarily, except that my senses were sharpfor any kind of human friendship."
14183,7,He wore a beat sweater and baggy pants and had nothing with himin the way of a bag - just a toothbrush and handkerchiefs.
14184,7,He said we ought to hitch together.
14185,7,"Ishould have said no, because he looked pretty awful on the road."
14186,7,"But we stuck together and got aride with a taciturn man to Stuart, Iowa, a town in which we were really stranded."
14187,7,"We stood in frontof the railroad-ticket shack in Stuart, waiting for the westbound traffic till the sun went down, a goodfive hours, dawdling away the time, at first telling about ourselves, then he told dirty stories, then wejust kicked pebbles and made goofy noises of one kind and another."
14188,7,We got bored.
14189,7,I decided tospend a buck on beer; we went to an old saloon in Stuart and had a few.
14190,7,"There he got as drunk ashe ever did in his Ninth Avenue night back home, and yelled joyously in my ear all the sordid dreamsof his life."
14191,7,"I kind of liked him; not because he was a good sort, as he later proved to be, but becausehe was enthusiastic about things."
14192,7,"We got back on the road in the darkness, and of course nobodystopped and nobody came by much."
14193,7,That went on till three o’clock in the morning.
14194,7,"We spent sometime trying to sleep on the bench at the railroad ticket office, but the telegraph clicked all night andwe couldn’t sleep, and big freights were slamming around outside."
14195,7,"We didn’t know how to hop aproper chain gang; we’d never done it before; we didn’t know whether they were going east or westor how to find out or what boxcars and flats and de-iced reefers to pick, and so on."
14196,7,So when theOmaha bus came through just before dawn we hopped on it and joined the sleeping passengers - Ipaid for his fare as well as mine.
14197,7,His name was Eddie.
14198,7,He reminded me of my cousin-in-law from theBronx.
14199,7,That was why I stuck with him.
14200,7,"It was like having an old friend along, a smiling good-naturedsort to goof along with.We arrived at Council Bluffs at dawn; I looked out."
14201,7,"All winter I’d been reading of the greatwagon parties that held council there before hitting the Oregon and Santa Fe trails; and of coursenow it was only cute suburban cottages of one damn kind and another, all laid out in the dismal graydawn."
14202,7,"Then Omaha, and, by God, the first cowboy I saw, walking along the bleak walls of thewholesale meat warehouses in a ten-gallon hat and Texas boots, looked like any beat character ofthe brickwall dawns of the East except for the getup."
14203,7,"We got off the bus and walked clear up the hill,the long hill formed over the millenniums by the mighty Missouri, alongside of which Omaha is built,and got out to the country and stuck our thumbs out."
14204,7,"We got a brief ride from a wealthy rancher in aten-gallon hat, who said the valley of the Platte was as great as the Nile Valley of Egypt, and as hesaid so I saw the great trees in the distance that snaked with the riverbed and the great verdant fieldsaround it, and almost agreed with him."
14205,7,"Then as we were standing at another crossroads and it wasstarting to get cloudy another cowboy, this one six feet tall in a modest half-gallon hat, called us overand wanted to know if either one of us could drive."
14206,7,"Of course Eddie could drive, and he had alicense and I didn’t."
14207,7,"Cowboy had two cars with him that he was driving back to Montana, 14His wife was at Grand Island, and he wanted us to drive one of the cars there, where she’d takeover."
14208,7,"At that point he was going north, and that would be the limit of our ride with him."
14209,7,"But it was agood hundred miles into Nebraska, and of course ,we jumped for it."
14210,7,"Eddie drove alone, the cowboyand myself following, and no sooner were we out of town than Eddie started to ball that jack ninetymiles an hour out of sheer exuberance."
14211,7,"«Damn me, what’s that boy doing!» the cowboy shouted,and took off after him."
14212,7,It began to be like a race.
14213,7,For a minute I thought Eddie was trying to getaway with the car - and for all I know that’s what he meant to do.
14214,7,But the cowboy stuck to him andcaught up with him and tooted the horn.
14215,7,Eddie slowed down.
14216,7,The cowboy tooted to stop.
14217,7,"«Damn,boy, you’re liable to get a flat going that speed."
14218,7,"Can’t you drive a little slower?»«Well, I’ll be damned, was I really going ninety?» said Eddie."
14219,7,«I didn’t realize it on this smoothroad.»«Just take it a little easy and we’ll all get to Grand Island in one piece.»«Sure thing.» And we resumed our journey.
14220,7,Eddie had calmed down and probably even gotsleepy.
14221,7,"So we drove a hundred miles across Nebraska, following the winding Platte with its verdantfields.«During the depression,» said the cowboy to me, «I used to hop freights at least once a month."
14222,7,"Inthose days you’d see hundreds of men riding a flatcar or in a boxcar, and they weren’t just bums,they were all kinds of men out of work and going from one place to another and some of them justwandering."
14223,7,It was like that all over the West.
14224,7,Brakemen never bothered you in those days.
14225,7,I don’tknow about today.
14226,7,Nebraska I ain’t got no use for.
14227,7,Why in the middle nineteen thirties this placewasn’t nothing but a big dustcloud as far as the eye could see.
14228,7,You couldn’t breathe.
14229,7,The groundwas black.
14230,7,I was here in those days.
14231,7,They can give Nebraska back to the Indians far as I’mconcerned.
14232,7,I hate this damn place more than’ any place in the world.
14233,7,Montana’s my home now -Missoula.
14234,7,You come up there sometime and see God’s country.» Later in the afternoon I slept whenhe got tired talking - he was an interesting talker.We stopped along the road for a bite to eat.
14235,7,"The cowboy went off to have a spare tire patched,and Eddie and I sat down in a kind of homemade diner."
14236,7,"I heard a great laugh, the greatest laugh inthe world, and here came this rawhide old-timer Nebraska farmer with a bunch of other boys intothe diner; you could hear his raspy cries clear across the plains, across the whole gray world of themthat day."
14237,7,Everybody else laughed with him.
14238,7,He didn’t have a care in the world and had the hugestregard for everybody.
14239,7,"I said to myself, Wham, listen to that man laugh."
14240,7,"That’s the West, here I am inthe West."
14241,7,"He came booming into the diner, calling Maw’s name, and she made the sweetest cherrypie in Nebraska, and I had some with a mountainous scoop of ice cream on top."
14242,7,"«Maw, rustle meup some grub afore I have to start eatin myself raw or some damn silly idee like that.» And he threwhimself on a stool and went hyaw hyaw hyaw hyaw."
14243,7,«And throw some beans in it.» It was the spiritof the West sitting right next to me.
14244,7,I wished I knew his whole raw life and what the hell he’d beendoing all these years besides laughing and yelling like that.
14245,7,"Whooee, I told my soul, and the cowboycame back and off we went to Grand Island.We got there in no time flat."
14246,7,"He went to fetch his wife and off to whatever fate awaited him, andEddie and I resumed on the road."
14247,7,"We got a ride from a couple of young fellows - wranglers,teenagers, country boys in a put-together jalopy - and were left off somewhere up the line in a thindrizzle of rain."
14248,7,Then an old man who said nothing - and God knows why he picked us up - took usto Shelton.
14249,7,"Here Eddie stood forlornly in the road in front of a staring bunch of short, squat OmahaIndians who had nowhere to go and nothing to do."
14250,7,Across the road was the railroad track and thewatertank saying SHELTON.
14251,7,"«Damn me,» said Eddie with amazement, «I’ve been in this townbefore."
14252,7,"It was years ago, during the war, at night, late at night when everybody was sleeping."
14253,7,"I went  15out on the platform to smoke, and there we was in the middle of nowhere and black as hell, and Ilook up and see that name Shelton written on the watertank."
14254,7,"Bound for the Pacific, everybodysnoring, every damn dumb sucker, and we only stayed a few minutes, stoking up or something, andoff we went."
14255,7,"Damn me, this Shelton! I hated this place ever since!» And we were stuck in Shelton.As in Davenport, Iowa, somehow all the cars were farmer-cars, and once in a while a tourist car,which is worse, with old men driving and their wives pointing out the sights or poring over maps, andsitting back looking at everything with suspicious faces.The drizzle increased and Eddie got cold; he had very little clothing."
14256,7,I fished a wool plaid shirtfrom my canvas bag and he put it on.
14257,7,He felt a little better.
14258,7,I had a cold.
14259,7,I bought cough drops in arickety Indian store of some kind.
14260,7,I went to the little two-by-four post office and wrote my aunt apenny postcard.
14261,7,We went back to the gray road.
14262,7,"There she was in front of us, Shelton, written onthe watertank."
14263,7,The Rock Island balled by.
14264,7,We saw the faces of Pullman passengers go by in a blur.The train howled off across the plains in the direction of our desires.
14265,7,"It started to rain harder.A tall, lanky fellow in a gallon hat stopped his car on the wrong side of the road and came over tous; he looked like a sheriff."
14266,7,We prepared our stories secretly.
14267,7,He took his time coming over.
14268,7,"«Youboys going to get somewhere, or just going?» We didn’t understand his question, and it was adamned good question.«Why?» we said.«Well, I own a little carnival that’s pitched a few mile down the road and I’m looking for someold boys willing to work and make a buck for themselves."
14269,7,"I’ve got a roulette concession and awooden-ring concession, you know, the kind you throw around dolls and take your luck."
14270,7,"You boyswant to work for me, you can get thirty per cent of the take.»«Room and board?»«You can get a bed but no food."
14271,7,You’ll have to eat in town.
14272,7,We travel some.» We thought itover.
14273,7,"«It’s a good opportunity,» he said, and waited patiently for us to make up our minds."
14274,7,"We feltsilly and didn’t know what to say, and I for one didn’t want to get hung-up with a carnival."
14275,7,"I was insuch a bloody hurry to get to the gang in Denver.I said, «I don’t know, I’m going as fast as I can and I don’t think I have the time.» Eddie said thesame thing, and the old man waved his hand and casually sauntered back to his car and drove off.And that was that."
14276,7,We laughed about it awhile and speculated about what it would have been like.
14277,7,"Ihad visions of a dark and dusty night on the plains, and the faces of Nebraska families wandering by,with their rosy children looking at everything with awe, and I know I would have felt like the devilhimself rooking them with all those cheap carnival tricks."
14278,7,"And the Ferris wheel revolving in theflatlands darkness, and, God almighty, the sad music of the merry-go-round and me wanting to geton to my goal - and sleeping in some gilt wagon on a bed of burlap.Eddie turned out to be a pretty absent-minded pal of the road."
14279,7,"A funny old contraption rolled by,driven by an old man; it was made of some kind of aluminum, square as a box - a trailer, no doubt,but a weird, crazy Nebraska homemade trailer."
14280,7,He was going very slow and stopped.
14281,7,"We rushedup; he said he could only take one; without a word Eddie jumped in and slowly rattled from my sight,and wearing my wool plaid shirt."
14282,7,"Well, alackaday, I kissed the shirt good-by; it had only sentimentalvalue in any case."
14283,7,"I waited in our personal godawful Shelton for a long, long time, several hours, andI kept thinking it was getting night; actually it was only early afternoon, but dark."
14284,7,"Denver, Denver,how would I ever get to Denver? I was just about giving up and planning to sit over coffee when afairly new car stopped, driven by a young guy."
14285,7,"I ran like mad.«Where you going?»«Denver.»16«Well, I can take you a hundred miles up the line.»«Grand, grand, you saved my life.»«I used to hitchhike myself, that’s why I always pick up a fellow.» «I would too if I had a car.» And so we talked, and he told me about his life, which wasn’t veryinteresting, and I started to sleep some and woke up right outside the town of Gothenburg, where helet me off. 17 4The greatest ride in my life was about to come up, a truck, with a flatboard at the back, withabout six or seven boys sprawled out on it, and the drivers, two young blond farmers fromMinnesota, were picking up every single soul they found on that road - the most smiling, cheerfulcouple of handsome bumpkins you could ever wish to see, both wearing cotton shirts and overalls,nothing else; both thick-wristed and earnest, with broad howareyou smiles for anybody and anythingthat came across their path."
14286,7,"I ran up, said «Is there room?» They said, «Sure, hop on, ‘sroom foreverybody.»I wasn’t on the flatboard before the truck roared off; I lurched, a rider grabbed me, and I satdown."
14287,7,"Somebody passed a bottle of rotgut, the bottom of it."
14288,7,"I took a big swig in the wild, lyrical,drizzling air of Nebraska."
14289,7,"«Whooee, here we go!» yelled a kid in a baseball cap, and they gunned upthe truck to seventy and passed everybody on the road."
14290,7,«We been riding this sonofabitch since DesMoines.
14291,7,These guys never stop.
14292,7,"Every now and then you have to yell for pisscall, otherwise you haveto piss off the air, and hang on, brother, hang on.»I looked at the company."
14293,7,"There were two young farmer boys from North Dakota in red baseballcaps, which is the standard North Dakota farmer-boy hat, and they were headed for the harvests;their old men had given them leave to hit the road for a summer."
14294,7,"There were two young city boysfrom Columbus, Ohio, high-school football players, chewing gum, winking, singing in the breeze, andthey said they were hitchhiking around the United States for the summer."
14295,7,"«We’re going to LA! «theyyelled.«What are you going to do there?»«Hell, we don’t know."
14296,7,Who cares?»Then there was a tall slim fellow who had a sneaky look.
14297,7,«Where you from?» I asked.
14298,7,"I was lyingnext to him on the platform; you couldn’t sit without bouncing off, it had no rails."
14299,7,"And he turnedslowly to me, opened his mouth, and said, «Mon-ta-na.»Finally there were Mississippi Gene and his charge."
14300,7,"Mississippi Gene was a little dark guy whorode freight trains around the country, a thirty-year-old hobo but with a youthful look so you couldn’ttell exactly what age he was."
14301,7,"And he sat on the boards crosslegged, looking out over the fieldswithout saying anything for hundreds of miles, and finally at one point he turned to me and said,«Where you headed?»I said Denver.«I got a sister there but I ain’t seed her for several couple years.» His language was melodiousand slow."
14302,7,He was patient.
14303,7,"His charge was a sixteen-year-old tall blond kid, also in hobo rags; that isto say, they wore old clothes that had been turned black by the soot of railroads and the dirt ofboxcars and sleeping on the ground."
14304,7,"The blond kid was also quiet and he seemed to be runningaway from something, and it figured to be the law the way he looked straight ahead and wet his lipsin worried thought."
14305,7,Montana Slim spoke to them occasionally with a sardonic and insinuating smile.They paid no attention to him.
14306,7,Slim was all insinuation.
14307,7,"I was afraid of his long goofy grin that heopened up straight in your face and held there half-moronically.«You got any money?» he said to me.«Hell no, maybe enough for a pint of whisky till I get to Denver."
14308,7,What about you?»«I know where I can get some.»«Where?»  «Anywhere.
14309,7,"You can always folly a man down an alley, can’t you?»  18«Yeah, I guess you can.»«I ain’t beyond doing it when I really need some dough."
14310,7,Headed up to Montana to see my father.I’ll have to get off this rig at Cheyenne and move up some other way.
14311,7,"These crazy boys are going toLos Angeles.»«Straight?»«All the way - if you want to go to LA you got a ride.»I mulled this over; the thought of zooming all night across Nebraska, Wyoming, and the Utahdesert in the morning, and then most likely the Nevada desert in the afternoon, and actually arriving inLos Angeles within a foreseeable space of time almost made me change my plans."
14312,7,But I had to go toDenver.
14313,7,"I’d have to get off at Cheyenne too, and hitch south ninety miles to Denver.I was glad when the two Minnesota farmboys who owned the truck decided to stop in NorthPlatte and eat; I wanted to have a look at them."
14314,7,They came out of the cab and smiled at all of us.«Pisscall!» said one.
14315,7,«Time to eat!» said the other.
14316,7,But they were the only ones in the party who hadmoney to buy food.
14317,7,"We all shambled after them to a restaurant run by a bunch of women, and sataround over hamburgers and coffee while they wrapped away enormous meals just as if they wereback in their mother’s kitchen."
14318,7,They were brothers; they were transporting farm machinery from LosAngeles to Minnesota and making good money at it.
14319,7,So on their trip to the Coast empty they pickedup everybody on the road.
14320,7,They’d done this about five times now; they were having a hell of a time.They liked everything.
14321,7,They never stopped smiling.
14322,7,"I tried to talk to them - a kind of dumb attempton my part to befriend the captains of our ship - and the only responses I got were two sunny smilesand large white corn-fed teeth.Everybody had joined them in the restaurant except the two hobo kids, Gene and his boy."
14323,7,"Whenwe all got back they were still sitting in the truck, forlorn and disconsolate."
14324,7,Now the darkness wasfalling.
14325,7,The drivers had a smoke; I jumped at the chance to go buy a bottle of whisky to keep warmin the rushing cold air of night.
14326,7,They smiled when I told them.
14327,7,"«Go ahead, hurry up.»«You can have a couple shots!» I reassured them.«Oh no, we never drink, go ahead.»Montana Slim and the two high-school boys wandered the streets of North Platte with me till Ifound a whisky store."
14328,7,"They chipped in some, and Slim some, and I bought a fifth."
14329,7,"Tall, sullen menwatched us go by from false-front buildings; the main street was lined with square box-houses."
14330,7,Therewere immense vistas of the plains beyond every sad street.
14331,7,"I felt something different in the air inNorth Platte, I didn’t know what it was."
14332,7,In five minutes I did.
14333,7,We got back on the truck and roaredoff.
14334,7,It got dark quickly.
14335,7,"We all had a shot, and suddenly I looked, and the verdant farmfields of thePlatte began to disappear and in their stead, so far you couldn’t see to the end, appeared long flatwastelands of sand and sagebrush."
14336,7,"I was astounded.«What in the hell is this?» I cried out to Slim.«This is the beginning of the rangelands, boy."
14337,7,Hand me another drink.»«Whoopee!» yelled the high-school boys.
14338,7,"«Columbus, so long! What would Sparkie and theboys say if they was here."
14339,7,Yow!»The drivers had switched up front; the fresh brother was gunning the truck to the limit.
14340,7,"The roadchanged too: humpy in the middle, with soft shoulders and a ditch on both sides about four feet deep,so that the truck bounced and teetered from one side of the road to the other - miraculously onlywhen there were no cars coming the opposite way - and I thought we’d all take a somersault."
14341,7,Butthey were tremendous drivers.
14342,7,"How that truck disposed of the Nebraska nub - the nub that sticksout over Colorado! And soon I realized I was actually at last over Colorado, though not officially init, but looking southwest toward Denver itself a few hundred miles away."
14343,7,I yelled for joy.
14344,7,We passed 19the bottle.
14345,7,"The great blazing stars came out, the far-receding sand hills got dim."
14346,7,I felt like an arrowthat could shoot out all the way.
14347,7,"  And suddenly Mississippi Gene turned to me from his crosslegged, patient reverie, and openedhis mouth, and leaned close, and said, «These plains put me in the mind of Texas.»   «Are you from Texas?»   «No sir, I’m from Green-veil Muzz-sippy.» And that was the way he said it."
14348,7,"  «Where’s that kid from?»   «He got into some kind of trouble back in Mississippi, so I offered to help him out."
14349,7,Boy’s neverbeen out on his own.
14350,7,"I take care of him best as I can, he’s only a child.» Although Gene was whitethere was something of the wise and tired old Negro in him, and something very much like ElmerHassel, the New York dope addict, in him, but a railroad Hassel, a traveling epic Hassel, crossingand recrossing the country every year, south in the winter and north in the summer, and only becausehe had no place he could stay in without getting tired of it and because there was nowhere to go buteverywhere, keep rolling under the stars, generally the Western stars."
14351,7,  «I been to Ogden a couple times.
14352,7,"If you want to ride on to Ogden I got some friends there wecould hole up with.»   «I’m going to Denver from Cheyenne.»   «Hell, go right straight thu, you don’t get a ride like this every day.»   This too was a tempting offer."
14353,7,What was in Ogden? «What’s Ogden?» I said.
14354,7,"  «It’s the place where most of the boys pass thu and always meet there; you’re liable to seeanybody there.»   In my earlier days I’d been to sea with a tall rawboned fellow from Louisiana called Big SlimHazard, William Holmes Hazard, who was hobo by choice."
14355,7,"As a little boy he’d seen a hobo comeup to ask his mother for a piece of pie, and she had given it to him, and when the hobo went offdown the road the little boy had said, «Ma, what is that fellow?» «Why."
14356,7,"that’s a ho-bo.» «Ma, Iwant to be a ho-bo someday.» «Shut your mouth, that’s not for the like of the Hazards.» But henever forgot that day, and when he grew up, after a shortspell playing football at LSU, he didbecome a hobo."
14357,7,Big Slim and I spent many nights telling stories and spitting tobacco juice in papercontainers.
14358,7,"There was something so indubitably reminiscent of Big Slim Hazard in Mississippi Gene’sdemeanor that I said, «Do you happen to have met a fellow called Big Slim Hazard somewhere?»   And he said, «You mean the tall fellow with the big laugh?»   «Well, that sounds like him."
14359,7,"He came from Ruston, Louisiana.»   «That’s right."
14360,7,Louisiana Slim he’s sometimes called.
14361,7,"Yes-sir, I shore have met Big Slim.»   «And he used to work in the East Texas oil fields?»   «East Texas is right."
14362,7,"And now he’s punching cows.»   And that was exactly right; and still I couldn’t believe Gene could have really known Slim, whomI’d been looking for, more or less, for years."
14363,7,"«And he used to work in tugboats in New York?»   «Well now, I don’t know about that.»   «I guess you only knew him in the West.»   «I reckon."
14364,7,"I ain’t never been to New York.»   «Well, damn me, I’m amazed you know him."
14365,7,This is a big country.
14366,7,"Yet I knew you must haveknown him.»   «Yessir, I know Big Slim pretty well."
14367,7,"Always generous with his money when he’s got some.Mean, tough fellow, too; I seen him flatten a policeman in the yards at Cheyenne, one punch.» Thatsounded like Big Slim; he was always practicing that one punch in the air; he looked like JackDempsey, but a young Jack Dempsey who drank.  20«Damn!» I yelled into the wind, and I had another shot, and by now I was feeling pretty good.Every shot was wiped away by the rushing wind of the open truck, wiped away of its bad effects,and the good effect sank in my stomach."
14368,7,"«Cheyenne, here I come!» I sang."
14369,7,"«Denver, look out foryour boy.»Montana Slim turned to me, pointed at my shoes, and commented, «You reckon if you put themthings in the ground something’ll grow up?» - without cracking a smile, of course, and the other boysheard him and laughed."
14370,7,"And they were the silliest shoes in America; I brought them along specificallybecause I didn’t want my feet to sweat in the hot road, and except for the rain in Bear Mountain theyproved to be the best possible shoes for my journey."
14371,7,So I laughed with them.
14372,7,"And the shoes werepretty ragged by now, the bits of colored leather sticking up like pieces of a fresh pineapple and mytoes showing through."
14373,7,"Well, we had another shot and laughed."
14374,7,"As in a dream we zoomed throughsmall crossroads towns smack out of the darkness, and passed long lines of lounging harvest handsand cowboys in the night."
14375,7,"They watched us pass in one motion of the head, and we saw them slaptheir thighs from the continuing dark the other side of town - we were a funny-looking crew.A lot of men were in this country at that time of the year; it was harvest time."
14376,7,The Dakota boyswere fidgeting.
14377,7,"«I think we’ll get off at the next pisscall; seems like there’s a lot of work aroundhere.»«All you got to do is move north when it’s over here,» counseled Montana Slim, «and jes followthe harvest till you get to Canada.» The boys nodded vaguely; they didn’t take much stock in hisadvice.Meanwhile the blond young fugitive sat the same way; every now and then Gene leaned out of hisBuddhistic trance over the rushing dark plains and said something tenderly in the boy’s ear."
14378,7,The boynodded.
14379,7,"Gene was taking care of him, of his moods and his fears."
14380,7,I wondered where the hell theywould go and what they would do.
14381,7,They had no cigarettes.
14382,7,"I squandered my pack on them, I lovedthem so."
14383,7,They were grateful and gracious.
14384,7,"They never asked, I kept offering."
14385,7,Montana Slim had hisown but never passed the pack.
14386,7,"We zoomed through another crossroads town, passed another lineof tall lanky men in jeans clustered in the dim light like moths on the desert, and returned to thetremendous darkness, and the stars overhead were pure and bright because of the increasingly thinair as we mounted the high hill of the western plateau, about a foot a mile, so they say, and no treesobstructing any low-leveled stars anywhere."
14387,7,And once I saw a moody whitefaced cow in the sage bythe road as we flitted by.
14388,7,"It was like riding a railroad train, just as steady and just as straight.By and by we came to a town, slowed down, and Montana Slim said, «Ah, pisscall,» but theMinnesotans didn’t stop and went right on through."
14389,7,"«Damn, I gotta go,» said Slim.«Go over the side,» said somebody.«Well, I will» he said, and slowly, as we all watched, he inched to the back of the platform on hishaunch, holding on as best he could, till his legs dangled over."
14390,7,Somebody knocked on the window ofthe cab to bring this to the attention of the brothers.
14391,7,Their great smiles broke as they turned.
14392,7,"And justas Slim was ready to proceed, precarious as it was already, they began zigzagging the truck atseventy miles an hour."
14393,7,He fell back a moment; we saw a whale’s spout in the air; he struggled backto a sitting position.
14394,7,They swung the truck.
14395,7,"Wham, over he went on his side, watering all overhimself."
14396,7,"In the roar we could hear him faintly cursing, like the whine of a man far across the hills.«Damn ."
14397,7,.
14398,7,.
14399,7,damn .
14400,7,.
14401,7,".» He never knew we were doing this deliberately; he just struggled, as grim asJob."
14402,7,"When he was finished, as such, he was wringing wet, and now he had to edge and shimmy hisway back, and with a most woebegone look, and everybody laughing, except the sad blond boy,and the Minnesotans roaring in the cab."
14403,7,"I handed him the bottle to make up for it.«What the hail,» he said, «was they doing that on purpose?»   21«They sure were.»«Well, damn me, I didn’t know that."
14404,7,"I know I tried it back in Nebraska and didn’t have half somuch trouble.»We came suddenly into the town of Ogallala, and here the fellows in the cab called out,«Pisscall!» and with great good delight."
14405,7,"Slim stood sullenly by the truck, ruing a lost opportunity.The two Dakota boys said good-by to everybody and figured they’d start harvesting here."
14406,7,"Wewatched them disappear in the night toward the shacks at the end of town where lights were burning,where a watcher of the night in jeans said the employment men would be."
14407,7,I had to buy morecigarettes.
14408,7,Gene and the blond boy followed me to stretch their legs.
14409,7,"I walked into the least likelyplace in the world, a kind of lonely Plains soda fountain for the local teenage girls and boys."
14410,7,"Theywere dancing, a few of them, to the music on the jukebox."
14411,7,There was a lull when we came in.
14412,7,"Geneand Blondey just stood there, looking at nobody; all they wanted was cigarettes."
14413,7,"There were somepretty girls, too."
14414,7,"And one of them made eyes at Blondey and he never saw it, and if he had hewouldn’t have cared, he was so sad and gone.I bought a pack each for them; they thanked me."
14415,7,The truck was ready to go.
14416,7,"It was getting onmidnight now, and cold."
14417,7,"Gene, who’d been around the country more times than he could count onhis fingers and toes, said the best thing to do now was for all of us to bundle up under the bigtarpaulin or we’d freeze."
14418,7,"In this manner, and with the rest of the bottle, we kept warm as the air grewice-cold and pinged our ears."
14419,7,The stars seemed to get brighter the more we climbed the High Plains.We were in Wyoming now.
14420,7,"Flat on my back, I stared straight up at the magnificent firmament,glorying in the time I was making, in how far I had come from sad Bear Mountain after all, andtingling with kicks at the thought of what lay ahead of me in Denver - whatever, whatever it wouldbe."
14421,7,And Mississippi Gene began to sing a song.
14422,7,"He sang it in a melodious, quiet voice, with a riveraccent, and it was simple, just «I got a purty little girl, she’s sweet six-teen, she’s the purti-est thingyou ever seen,» repeating it with other lines thrown in, all concerning how far he’d been and how hewished he could go back to her but he done lost her.I said, «Gene, that’s the prettiest song.»«It’s the sweetest I know,» he said with a smile.«I hope you get where you’re going, and be happy when you do.»«I always make out and move along one way or the other.»,Montana Slim was asleep."
14423,7,"He woke up and said to me,’ «Hey, Blackie, how about you and meinvestigatin’ Cheyenne \ together tonight before you go to Denver?»«Sure thing.» I was drunk enough to go for anything.As the truck reached the outskirts of Cheyenne, we saw the high red lights of the local radiostation, and suddenly we were bucking through a great crowd of people that poured along bothsidewalks."
14424,7,"«Hell’s bells, it’s Wild West Week,» said Slim."
14425,7,"Big crowds of businessmen, fatbusinessmen in boots and ten-gallon hats, with their hefty wives in cowgirl attire, bustled andwhoopeed on the wooden sidewalks of old Cheyenne; farther down were the long stringy boulevardlights of new downtown Cheyenne, but the celebration was focusing on Oldtown."
14426,7,Blank guns wentoff.
14427,7,The saloons were crowded to the sidewalk.
14428,7,"I was amazed, and at the same time I felt it wasridiculous: in my first shot at the West I was seeing to what absurd devices it had fallen to keep itsproud tradition."
14429,7,We had to jump off the truck and say good-by; the Minnesotans weren’t interestedin hanging around.
14430,7,"It was sad to see them go, and I realized that I would never see any of themagain, but that’s the way it was."
14431,7,"«You’ll freeze your ass tonight,» I warned."
14432,7,"«Then you’ll burn ‘em inthe desert tomorrow afternoon.»«That’s all right with me long’s as we get out of this cold night,» said Gene."
14433,7,"And the truck left, 22threading its way through the crowds, and nobody paying attention to the strangeness of the kidsinside the tarpaulin, staring at the town like babes from a coverlet."
14434,7,I watched it disappear into thenight.  23  5 I was with Montana Slim and we started hitting the bars.
14435,7,"I had about seven dollars, five of which Ifoolishly squandered that night."
14436,7,"First we milled with all the cowboy-dudded tourists and oilmen andranchers, at bars, in doorways, on the sidewalk; then for a while I shook Slim, who was wandering alittle slaphappy in the street from all the whisky and beer: he was that kind of drinker; his eyes gotglazed, and in a minute he’d be telling an absolute stranger about things."
14437,7,I went into a chili joint andthe waitress was Mexican and beautiful.
14438,7,"I ate, and then I wrote her a little love note on the back ofthe bill."
14439,7,"The chili joint was deserted; everybody was somewhere else, drinking."
14440,7,I told her to turn thebill over.
14441,7,She read it and laughed.
14442,7,It was a little poem about how I wanted her to come and see thenight with me.
14443,7,"«I’d love to, Chiquito, but I have a date with my boy friend.» «Can’t you shake him?» «No, no, I don’t,» she said sadly, and I loved the way she said it."
14444,7,"«Some other time I’ll come by here,» I said, and she said, «Any time, kid.» Still I hung around,just to look at her, and had another cup of coffee."
14445,7,Her boy friend came in sullenly and wanted toknow when she was off.
14446,7,She bustled around to close the place quick.
14447,7,I had to get out.
14448,7,I gave her asmile when I left.
14449,7,"Things were going on as wild as ever outside, except that the fat burpers weregetting drunker and whooping up louder."
14450,7,It was funny.
14451,7,There were Indian chiefs wandering around inbig headdresses and really solemn among the flushed drunken faces.
14452,7,I saw Slim tottering along andjoined him.
14453,7,"He said, «I just wrote a postcard to my Paw in Montana."
14454,7,You reckon you can find a mailbox andput it in?» It was a strange request; he gave me the postcard and tottered through the swinging doorsof a saloon.
14455,7,"I took the card, went to the box, and took a quick look at it."
14456,7,"«Dear Paw, I’ll be homeWednesday."
14457,7,Everything’s all right with me and I hope the same is with you.
14458,7,Richard.» It gave me adifferent idea of him; how tenderly polite he was with his father.
14459,7,I went in the bar and joined him.
14460,7,"Wepicked up two girls, a pretty young blonde and a fat brunette."
14461,7,"They were dumb and sullen, but wewanted to make them."
14462,7,"We took them to a rickety nightclub that was already closing, and there Ispent all but two dollars on Scotches for them and beer for us."
14463,7,I was getting drunk and didn’t care;everything was fine.
14464,7,My whole being and purpose was pointed at the little blonde.
14465,7,I wanted to go inthere with all my strength.
14466,7,I hugged her and wanted to tell her.
14467,7,The nightclub closed and we allwandered out in the rickety dusty streets.
14468,7,"I looked up at the sky; the pure, wonderful stars were stillthere, burning."
14469,7,"The girls wanted to go to the bus station, so we all went, but they apparently wantedto meet some sailor who was there waiting for them, a cousin of the fat girl’s, and the sailor hadfriends with him."
14470,7,"I said to the blonde, «What’s up?» She said she wanted to go home, in Coloradojust over the line south of Cheyenne."
14471,7,"«I’ll take you in a bus,» I said."
14472,7,"«No, the bus stops on the highway and I have to walk across that damn prairie all by myself."
14473,7,"Ispend all afternoon looking at the damn thing and I don’t aim to walk over it tonight.» «Ah, listen, we’ll take a nice walk in the prairie flowers.» «There ain’t no flowers there,» she said."
14474,7,«I want to go to New York.
14475,7,"I’m sick and tired of this.Ain’t no place to go but Cheyenne and ain’t nothin in Cheyenne.» «Ain’t nothin in New York.» «Hell there ain’t,» she said with a curl of her lips."
14476,7,The bus station was crowded to the doors.
14477,7,"All kinds of people were waiting for buses or juststanding around; there were a lot of Indians, who watched everything with their stony eyes."
14478,7,The girl  24disengaged herself from my talk and joined the sailor and the others.
14479,7,Slim was dozing on a bench.
14480,7,Isat down.
14481,7,"The floors of bus stations are the same all over the country, always covered with butts andspit and they give a feeling of sadness that only bus stations have."
14482,7,"For a moment it was no differentfrom being in Newark, except for the great hugeness outside that I loved so much."
14483,7,"I rued the way Ihad broken up the purity of my entire trip, not saving every dime, and dawdling and not really makingtime, fooling around with this sullen girl and spending all my money."
14484,7,It made me sick.
14485,7,"I hadn’t slept inso long I got too tired to curse and fuss and went off to sleep; I curled up on the seat with my canvasbag for a pillow, and slept till eight o’clock in the morning among the dreamy murmurs and noises ofthe station and of hundreds of people passing.I woke up with a big headache."
14486,7,"Slim was gone - to Montana, I guess."
14487,7,I went outside.
14488,7,"And therein the blue air I saw for the first time, far off, the great snowy tops of the Rocky Mountains."
14489,7,I took adeep breath.
14490,7,I had to get to Denver at once.
14491,7,"First I ate a breakfast, a modest one of toast and coffeeand one egg, and then I cut out of town to the highway."
14492,7,"The Wild West festival was still going on;there was a rodeo, and the whooping and jumping were about to start all over again."
14493,7,I left it behindme.
14494,7,I wanted to see my gang in Denver.
14495,7,"I crossed a railroad overpass and reached a bunch ofshacks where two highways forked off, both for Denver."
14496,7,"I took the one nearest the mountains so Icould look at them, and pointed myself that way."
14497,7,"I got a ride right off from a young fellow fromConnecticut who was driving around the country in his jalopy, painting; he was the son of an editor inthe East."
14498,7,He talked and talked; I was sick from drinking and from the altitude.
14499,7,At one point I almosthad to stick my head out the window.
14500,7,"But by the time he let me off at Longmont, Colorado, I wasfeeling normal again and had even started telling him about the state of my own travels."
14501,7,He wishedme luck.It was beautiful in Longmont.
14502,7,Under a tremendous old tree was a bed of green lawn-grassbelonging to a gas station.
14503,7,"I asked the attendant if I could sleep there, and he said sure; so Istretched out a wool shirt, laid my face flat on it, with an elbow out, and with one eye cocked at thesnowy Rockies in the hot sun for just a moment."
14504,7,"I fell asleep for two delicious hours, the onlydiscomfort being an occasional Colorado ant."
14505,7,"And here I am in Colorado! I kept thinking gleefully.Damn! damn! damn! I’m making it! And after a refreshing sleep filled with cobwebby dreams of mypast life in the East I got up, washed in the station men’s room, and strode off, fit and slick as afiddle, and got me a rich thick milkshake at the road-house to put some freeze in my hot, tormentedstomach.Incidentally, a very beautiful Colorado gal shook me that cream; she was all smiles too; I wasgrateful, it made up for last night."
14506,7,"I said to myself, Wow! What’ll Denver be like! I got on that hotroad, and off I went in a brand-new car driven by a Denver businessman of about thirty-five."
14507,7,Hewent seventy.
14508,7,I tingled all over; I counted minutes and subtracted miles.
14509,7,"Just ahead, over the rollingwheatfields all golden beneath the distant snows of Estes, I’d be seeing old Denver at last."
14510,7,"I picturedmyself in a Denver bar that night, with all the gang, and in their eyes I would be strange and raggedand like the Prophet who has walked across the land to bring the dark Word, and the only Word Ihad was «Wow!» The man and I had a long, warm conversation about our respective schemes inlife, and before I knew it we were going over the wholesale fruitmarkets outside Denver; there weresmokestacks, smoke, railyards, red-brick buildings, and the distant downtown gray-stone buildings,and here I was in Denver."
14511,7,He let me off at Larimer Street.
14512,7,"I stumbled along with the most wickedgrin of joy in the world, among the old bums and beat cowboys of Larimer Street. 25 6In those days I didn’t know Dean as well as I do now, and the first thing I wanted to do was lookup Chad King, which I did."
14513,7,"I called up his house, talked to his mother - she said, «Why, Sal, whatare you doing in Denver?» Chad is a slim blond boy with a strange witch-doctor face that goes’ withhis interest in anthropology and prehistory Indians."
14514,7,"His nose beaks softly and almost creamily under agolden flare or’ hair; he has the beauty and grace of a Western hotshot who’:, danced in roadhousesand played a little football."
14515,7,A quavering twang comes out when he speaks.
14516,7,"«The thing I always liked,Sal, about the Plains Indians was the way they always got s’danged embarrassed after they boastedthe number of scalps they got."
14517,7,In Ruxton’s Life in the Far West there’s an Indian who gets red allover blushing because he got so many scalps and he runs like hell into the plains to glory over hisdeeds in hiding.
14518,7,"Damn, that tickled me!»Chad’s mother located him, in the drowsy Denver afternoon, working over his Indian basket-making at the local museum."
14519,7,"I called him there; he came and picked me up in his old Ford coupe thathe used to take trips in the mountains, to dig for Indian objects."
14520,7,He came into the bus station wearingjeans and a big smile.
14521,7,"I was sitting on my bag on the floor talking to the very same sailor who’d beenin the Cheyenne bus station with me, asking him what happened to the blonde."
14522,7,He was so bored hedidn’t answer.
14523,7,Chad and I got in his little coupe and the first thing he had to do was get maps at theState building.
14524,7,"Then he had to see an old schoolteacher, and so on, and all I wanted to do was drinkbeer."
14525,7,"And in the back of my mind was the wild thought, Where is Dean and what is he doing rightnow? Chad had decided not to be Dean’s friend any more, for some odd reason, and he didn’t evenknow where he lived.«Is Carlo Marx in town?»«Yes.» But he wasn’t talking to him any more either."
14526,7,This was the beginning of Chad King’swithdrawal from our general gang.
14527,7,I was to take a nap in his house that afternoon.
14528,7,"The word wasthat Tim Gray had an apartment waiting for me up Coif ax Avenue, that Roland Major was alreadyliving in it and was waiting for me to join him."
14529,7,"I sensed some kind of conspiracy in the air, and thisconspiracy lined up two groups in the gang: it was Chad King and Tim Gray and Roland Major,together with the Rawlinses, generally agreeing to ignore Dean Moriarty and Carlo Marx."
14530,7,I wassmack in the middle of this interesting war.It was a war with social overtones.
14531,7,"Dean was the son of a wino, one of the most tottering bums ofLarimer Street, and Dean had in fact been brought up generally on Larimer Street and thereabouts.He used to plead in court at the age of six to have his father set free."
14532,7,"He used to beg in front ofLarimer alleys and sneak the money back to his father, who waited among the broken bottles with anold buddy."
14533,7,Then when Dean grew up he began hanging around the Glenarm pool-halls; he set aDenver record for stealing cars and went to the reformatory.
14534,7,From the age of eleven to seventeen hewas usually in reform school.
14535,7,"His specialty was stealing cars, gunning for girls coming out of highschool in the afternoon, driving them out to the mountains, making them, and coming back to sleep inany available hotel bathtub in town."
14536,7,"His father, once a respectable and hardworking tinsmith, hadbecome a wine alcoholic, which is worse than a whisky alcoholic, and was reduced to riding freightsto Texas in the winter and back to Denver in the summer."
14537,7,Dean had brothers on his dead mother’sside - she died when he was small - but they disliked him.
14538,7,Dean’s only buddies were the poolhallboys.
14539,7,"Dean, who had the tremendous energy of a new kind of American saint, and Carlo were theunderground monsters of that season in Denver, together with the poolhall gang, and, symbolizing thismost beautifully, Carlo had a basement apartment on Grant Street and we all met there many a night  26that went to dawn - Carlo, Dean, myself, Tom Snark, Ed Dunkel, and Roy Johnson."
14540,7,More of theseothers later.
14541,7,  My first afternoon in Denver I slept in Chad King’s room while his mother went on with herhousework downstairs and Chad worked at the library.
14542,7,It was a hot high-plains afternoon in July.
14543,7,Iwould not have slept if it hadn’t been for Chad King’s father’s invention.
14544,7,"Chad King’s father, a finekind man, was in his seventies, old and feeble, thin and drawn-out, and telling stories with a slow,slow relish; good stories, too, about his boyhood on the North Dakota plains in the eighties, whenfor diversion he rode ponies bareback and chased after coyotes with a club."
14545,7,"Later he became acountry schoolteacher in the Oklahoma panhandle, and finally a businessman of many devices inDenver."
14546,7,"He still had his old office over a garage down the street - the rolltop desk was still there,together with countless dusty papers of past excitement and moneymaking."
14547,7,He had invented a.
14548,7,Hopping a freight out of Los Angeles at high noon one day in late September 1955 I got ona gondola and lay down with my duffel bag under my head and my knees crossed andcontemplated the clouds as we rolled north to Santa Barbara.
14549,7,"It was a local and I intended tosleep on the beach at Santa Barbara that night and catch either another local to San LuisObispo the next morning or the first class freight all the way to San Francisco at seven p.m.Somewhere near Camarillo where Charlie Parker'd been mad and relaxed back to normalhealth, a thin old little bum climbed into my gondola as we headed into a siding to give a trainright of way and looked surprised to see me there."
14550,7,"He established himself at the other end ofthe gondola and lay down, facing me, with his head on his own miserably small pack and saidnothing."
14551,7,By and by they blew the highball whistle after the eastbound freight had smashedthrough on the main line and we pulled out as the air got colder and fog began to blow fromthe sea over the warm valleys of the coast.
14552,7,"Both the little bum and I, after unsuccessfulattempts to huddle on the cold steel in wraparounds, got up and paced back and forth andjumped and flapped arms at each our end of the gon."
14553,7,Pretty soon we headed into anothersiding at a small railroad town and I figured I needed a poorboy of Tokay wine to completethe cold dusk run to Santa Barbara.
14554,7,"""Will you watch my pack while I run over there and get abottle of wine?""""Sure thing.""I jumped over the side and ran across Highway 101 to the store, and bought, besides wine,a little bread and candy."
14555,7,I ran back to my freight train which had another fifteen minutes towait in the now warm sunny scene.
14556,7,But it was late afternoon and bound to get cold soon.
14557,7,Thelittle bum was sitting cross-legged at his end before a pitiful repast of one can of sardines.
14558,7,"Itook pity on him and went over and said, ""How about a little wine to warm you up? Maybeyou'd like some bread and cheese with your sardines.""""Sure thing."" He spoke from far away inside a little meek voice-box afraid or unwilling toassert himself."
14559,7,I'd bought the cheese three days ago in Mexico City before the long cheap bustrip across Zacatecas and Durango and Chihuahua two thousand long miles to the border at ElPaso.
14560,7,He ate the cheese and bread and drank the wine with gusto and gratitude.
14561,7,"I was pleased.I reminded myself of the line in the Diamond Sutra that says, ""Practice charity withoutholding in mind any conceptions about charity, for charity after all is just a word."" I was verydevout in those days and was practicing my religious devotions almost to perfection."
14562,7,Sincethen I've become a little hypocritical about my lip-service and a little tired and cynical.Because now I am grown so old and neutral.
14563,7,.
14564,7,.
14565,7,.
14566,7,"But then I really believed in the reality ofcharity and kindness and humility and zeal and neutral tranquillity and wisdom and ecstasy,and I believed that I was an old time bhikku in modern clothes wandering the world (usuallythe immense triangular arc of New York to Mexico City to San Francisco) in order to turn thewheel of the True Meaning, or Dharma, and gain merit for myself as a future Buddha(Awakener) and as a future Hero in Paradise."
14567,7,"I had not met Japhy Ryder yet, I was about tothe next week, or heard anything about ""Dharma Bums"" although at this time I was a perfectDharma Bum myself and considered myself a religious wanderer."
14568,7,"The little bum in thegondola solidified all my beliefs by warming up to the wine and talking and finally whippingout a tiny slip of paper which contained a prayer by Saint Teresa announcing that after herdeath she will return to the earth by showering it with roses from heaven, forever, for allliving creatures.""Where did you get this?"" I asked.""Oh, I cut it out of a reading-room magazine in Los Angeles couple of years ago."
14569,7,"I alwayscarry it, with me.""""And you squat in boxcars and read it?"" 5""Most every day."" He talked not much more than this, didn't amplify on the subject ofSaint Teresa, and was very modest about his religion and told me little about his personal life.He is the kind of thin quiet little bum nobody pays much attention to even in Skid Row, letalone Main Street."
14570,7,"If a cop hustled him off, he hustled, and disappeared, and if yard dickswere around in big city yards when a freight was pulling out, chances are they never got asight of the little man hiding in the weeds and hopping on in the shadows."
14571,7,"When I told him Iwas planning to hop the Zipper first class freight train the next night he said, ""Ah you meanthe Midnight Ghost.""""Is that what you call the Zipper?""""You musta been a railroad man on that railroad.""""I was, I was a brakeman on the S.P.""""Well, we bums call it the Midnight Ghost cause you get on it at L.A."
14572,7,"and nobody sees youtill you get to San Francisco in the morning the thing flies so fast.""""Eighty miles an hour on the straightaways, pap.""""That's right but it gits mighty cold at night when you're flyin up that coast north ofGavioty and up around Surf.""""Surf that's right, then the mountains down south of Margarita.""""Margarity, that's right, but I've rid that Midnight Ghost more times'n I can count I guess.""""How many years been since you've been home?""""More years than I care to count I guess."
14573,7,"Ohio was where I was from.""But the train got started, the wind grew cold and foggy again, and we spent the followinghour and a half doing everything in our power and will power not to freeze and chatter-teethtoo much."
14574,7,"I'd huddle and meditate on the warmth, the actual warmth of God, to obviate thecold; then I'd jump up and flap my arms and legs and sing."
14575,7,But the little bum had morepatience than I had and just lay there most of the time chewing his cud in forlorn bitter-lippedthought.
14576,7,"My teeth were chattering, my lips blue."
14577,7,"By dark we saw with relief the familiarmountains of Santa Barbara taking shape and soon we'd be stopped and warm in the warmstarlit night by the tracks.I bade farewell to the little bum of Saint Teresa at the crossing, where we jumped off, andwent to sleep the night in the sand in my blankets, far down the beach at the foot of a cliffwhere cops wouldn't see me and drive me away."
14578,7,"I cooked hot-dogs on freshly cut andsharpened sticks over the coals of a big wood fire, and heated a can of beans and a can ofcheese macaroni in the red hot hollows, and drank my newly bought wine, and exulted in oneof the most pleasant nights of my life."
14579,7,"I waded in the water and dunked a little and stoodlooking up at the splendorous night sky, Avalokitesvara's ten-wondered universe of dark anddiamonds."
14580,7,"""Well, Ray,"" sez I, glad, ""only a few miles to go."
14581,7,"You've done it again."" Happy.Just in my swim shorts, barefooted, wild-haired, in the red fire dark, singing, swigging wine,spitting, jumping, running—that's the way to live."
14582,7,"All alone and free in the soft sands of thebeach by the sigh of the sea out there, with the Ma-Wink fallopian virgin warm starsreflecting on the outer channel fluid belly waters."
14583,7,"And if your cans are red hot and you can'thold them in your hands, just use good old railroad gloves, that's all."
14584,7,I let the food cool a littleto enjoy more wine and my thoughts.
14585,7,"I sat cross-legged in the sand and contemplated my life.Well, there, and what difference did it make? ""What's going to happen to me up ahead?"" Thenthe wine got to work on my taste buds and before long I had to pitch into those hot dogs,biting them right off the end of the stick spit, and chomp chomp, and dig down into the twotasty cans with the old pack spoon, spooning up rich bites of hot beans and pork, or ofmacaroni with sizzling hot sauce, and maybe a little sand thrown in."
14586,7,"""And how many grains ofsand are there on this beach?"" I think."
14587,7,"""Why, as many grains of sand as there are stars in thatsky!"" (chomp chomp) and if so ""How many human beings have there been, in fact how manyliving creatures have there been, since before the less part of beginningless time? Why, oy, I   6reckon you would have to calculate the number of grains of sand on this beach and on everystar in the sky, in every one of the ten thousand great chilicosms, which would be a number ofsand grains uncomputable by IBM and Burroughs too, why boy I don't rightly know"" (swig ofwine) ""I don't rightly know but it must be a couple umpteen trillion sextillion infideled andbusted up innumerable number of roses that sweet Saint Teresa and that fine little old man arenow this minute showering on your head, with lilies.""   Then, meal done, wiping my lips with my red bandana, I washed up the dishes in the saltsea, kicked a few clods of sand, wandered around, wiped them, put them away, stuck the oldspoon back in the salty pack, and lay down curled in my blanket for a night's good and justrest."
14588,7,"Waking up in the middle of the night, ""Wa? Where am I, what is the basketbally game ofeternity the girls are playing here by me in the old house of my life, the house isn't on fire isit?"" but it's only the banding rush of waves piling up higher closer high tide to my blanketbed."
14589,7,"""I be as hard and old as a conch shell,"" and I go to sleep and dream that while sleeping Iuse up three slices of bread breathing."
14590,7,.
14591,7,.
14592,7,.
14593,7,"Ah poor mind of man, and lonely man alone on thebeach, and God watching with intent smile I'd say."
14594,7,.
14595,7,.
14596,7,.
14597,7,"And I dreamed of home long ago inNew England, my little kitkats trying to go a thousand miles following me on the road acrossAmerica, and my mother with a pack on her back, and my father running after the ephemeraluncatchable train, and I dreamed and woke up to a gray dawn, saw it, sniffed (because I hadseen all the horizon shift as if a sceneshifter had hurried to put it back in place and make mebelieve in its reality), and went back to sleep, turning over."
14598,7,"""It's all the same thing,"" I heardmy voice say in the void that's highly embraceable during sleep.   7   2The little Saint Teresa bum was the first genuine Dharma Bum I'd met, and the second wasthe number one Dharma Bum of them all and in fact it was he, Japhy Ryder, who coined thephrase."
14599,7,"Japhy Ryder was a kid from eastern Oregon brought up in a log cabin deep in thewoods with his father and mother and sister, from the beginning a woods boy, an axman,farmer, interested in animals and Indian lore so that when he finally got to college by hook orcrook he was already well equipped for his early studies in anthropology and later in Indianmyth and in the actual texts of Indian mythology."
14600,7,"Finally he learned Chinese and Japaneseand became an Oriental scholar and discovered the greatest Dharma Bums of them all, theZen Lunatics of China and Japan."
14601,7,"At the same time, being a Northwest boy with idealistictendencies, he got interested in old-fashioned I.W.W."
14602,7,anarchism and learned to play the guitarand sing old worker songs to go with his Indian songs and general folk song interests.
14603,7,"I firstsaw him walking down the street in San Francisco the following week (after hitchhiking therest of the way from Santa Barbara in one long zipping ride given me, as though anybody'llbelieve this, by a beautiful darling young blonde in a snow-white strapless bathing suit andbarefooted with a gold bracelet on her ankle, driving a next-year's cinnamon-red LincolnMercury, who wanted benzedrine so she could drive all the way to the City and when I said Ihad some in my duffel bag yelled ""Crazy!"") —I saw Japhy loping along in that curious longstride of the mountain climber, with a small knapsack on his back filled with books andtoothbrushes and whatnot which was his small ""goin-to-the-city"" knapsack as apart from hisbig full rucksack complete with sleeping bag, poncho, and cook pots."
14604,7,"He wore a little goatee,strangely Oriental-looking with his somewhat slanted green eyes, but he didn't look like aBohemian at all, and was far from being a Bohemian (a hanger-onner around the arts)."
14605,7,"He waswiry, suntanned, vigorous, open, all howdies and glad talk and even yelling hello to bums onthe street and when asked a question answered right off the bat from the top or bottom of hismind I don't know which and always in a sprightly sparkling way.""Where did you meet Ray Smith?"" they asked him when we walked into The Place, thefavorite bar of the hep cats around the Beach.""Oh I always meet my Bodhisattvas in the street!"" he yelled, and ordered beers.It was a great night, a historic night in more ways than one."
14606,7,He and some other poets (healso wrote poetry and translated Chinese and Japanese poetry into English) were scheduled togive a poetry reading at the Gallery Six in town.
14607,7,They were all meeting in the bar and gettinghigh.
14608,7,"But as they stood and sat around I saw that he was the only one who didn't look like apoet, though poet he was indeed."
14609,7,"The other poets were either horn-rimmed intellectual hepcats with wild black hair like Alvah Goldbook, or delicate pale handsome poets like IkeO'Shay (in a suit), or out-of-this-world genteel-looking Renaissance Italians like FrancisDaPavia (who looks like a young priest), or bow-tied wild-haired old anarchist fuds likeRheinhold Cacoethes, or big fat bespectacled quiet booboos like Warren Coughlin."
14610,7,"And allthe other hopeful poets were standing around, in various costumes, worn-at-the-sleevescorduroy jackets, scuffly shoes, books sticking out of their pockets."
14611,7,"But Japhy was in roughworlungman's clothes he'd bought secondhand in Goodwill stores to serve him on mountainclimbs and hikes and for sitting in the open at night, for campfires, for hitchhiking up anddown the Coast."
14612,7,"In fact in his little knapsack he also had a funny green alpine cap that hewore when he got to the foot of a mountain, usually with a yodel, before starting to tromp upa few thousand feet."
14613,7,"He wore mountain-climbing boots, expensive ones, his pride and joy,Italian make, in which he clomped around over the sawdust floor of the bar like an old-timelumberjack."
14614,7,"Japhy wasn't big, just about five foot seven, but strong and wiry and fast andmuscular."
14615,7,"His face was a mask of woeful bone, but his eyes twinkled like the eyes of oldgiggling sages of China, over that little goatee, to offset the rough look of his handsome face.   8His teeth were a little brown, from early backwoods neglect, but you never noticed that and heopened his mouth wide to guffaw at jokes."
14616,7,"Sometimes he'd quiet down and just stare sadly atthe floor, like a man whittling."
14617,7,He was merry at times.
14618,7,He showed great sympathetic interestin me and in the story about the little Saint Teresa bum and the stories I told him about myown experiences hopping freights or hitchhiking or hiking in woods.
14619,7,"He claimed at once that Iwas a great ""Bodhisattva,"" meaning ""great wise being"" or ""great wise angel,"" and that I wasornamenting this world with my sincerity."
14620,7,"We had the same favorite Buddhist saint, too:Avalokitesvara, or, in Japanese, Kwannon the Eleven-Headed."
14621,7,"He knew all the details ofTibetan, Chinese, Mahayana, Hinayana, Japanese and even Burmese Buddhism but Iwarned him at once I didn't give a goddamn about the mythology and all the names andnational flavors of Buddhism, but was just interested in the first of Sakyamuni's four nobletruths, All life is suffering."
14622,7,"And to an extent interested in the third, The suppression ofsuffering can be achieved, which I didn't quite believe was possible then."
14623,7,"(I hadn't yetdigested the Lankavatara Scripture which eventually shows you that there's nothing in theworld but the mind itself, and therefore all's possible including the suppression of suffering.)Japhy's buddy was the aforementioned booboo big old goodhearted Warren Coughlin ahundred and eighty pounds of poet meat, who was advertised by Japhy (privately in my ear)as being more than meets the eye."
14624,7,"""Who is he?""   ""He's my big best friend from up in Oregon, we've known each other a long time."
14625,7,At firstyou think he's slow and stupid but actually he's a shining diamond.
14626,7,You'll see.
14627,7,Don't let himcut you to ribbons.
14628,7,"He'll make the top of your head fly away, boy, with a choice chanceword."" ""Why?"" ""He's a great mysterious Bodhisattva I think maybe a reincarnation of Asagnathe great Mahayana scholar of the old centuries.""   ""And who am I?""   ""I dunno, maybe you're Goat.""   ""Goat?""   ""Maybe you're Mudface.""   ""Who's Mudface?""   ""Mudface is the mud in your goat face."
14629,7,"What would you say if someone was asked thequestion 'Does a dog have the Buddha nature?' and said 'Woof!' ""   ""I'd say that was a lot of silly Zen Buddhism."" This took Japhy back a bit."
14630,7,"""Lissen Japhy,"" Isaid, ""I'm not a Zen Buddhist, I'm a serious Buddhist, I'm an old-fashioned dreamy Hinayanacoward of later Mahayanism,"" and so forth into the night, my contention being that ZenBuddhism didn't concentrate on kindness so much as on confusing the intellect to make itperceive the illusion of all sources of things."
14631,7,"""It's mean"" I complained."
14632,7,"""All those Zen Mastersthrowing young kids in the mud because they can't answer their silly word questions.""   ""That's because they want them to realize mud is better than words, boy."" But I can'trecreate the exact (will try) brilliance of all Japhy's answers and come-backs and come-onswith which he had me on pins and needles all the rime and did eventually stick something inmy crystal head that made me change my plans in life."
14633,7,"  Anyway I followed the whole gang of howling poets to the reading at Gallery Six thatnight, which was, among other important things, the night of the birth of the San FranciscoPoetry Renaissance."
14634,7,Everyone was there.
14635,7,It was a mad night.
14636,7,"And I was the one who gotthings jumping by going around collecting dimes and quarters from the rather stiff audiencestanding around in the gallery and coming back with three huge gallon jugs of CaliforniaBurgundy and getting them all piffed so that by eleven o'clock when Alvah Goldbook wasreading his, wailing his poem ""Wail"" drunk with arms outspread everybody was yelling ""Go!Go! Go!"" (like a jam session) and old Rheinhold Cacoethes the father of the Frisco poetryscene was wiping his tears in gladness."
14637,7,"Japhy himself read his fine poems about Coyote theGod of the North American Plateau Indians (I think), at least the God of the Northwest9Indians, Kwakiutl and what-all."
14638,7,"""Fuck you! sang Coyote, and ran away!"" read Japhy to thedistinguished audience, making them all howl with joy, it was so pure, fuck being a dirtyword that comes out clean."
14639,7,"And he had his tender lyrical lines, like the ones about bears eatingberries, showing his love of animals, and great mystery lines about oxen on the Mongolianroad showing his knowledge of Oriental literature even on to Hsuan Tsung the great Chinesemonk who walked from China to Tibet, Lanchow to Kashgar and Mongolia carrying a stick ofincense in his hand."
14640,7,Then Japhy showed his sudden barroom humor with lines about Coyotebringing goodies.
14641,7,"And his anarchistic ideas about how Americans don't know how to live,with lines about commuters being trapped in living rooms that come from poor trees felled bychainsaws (showing here, also, his background as a logger up north)."
14642,7,"His voice was deep andresonant and somehow brave, like the voice of old-time American heroes and orators.Something earnest and strong and humanly hopeful I liked about him, while the other poetswere either too dainty in their aestheticism, or too hysterically cynical to hope for anything, ortoo abstract and indoorsy, or too political, or like Coughlin too incomprehensible tounderstand (big Coughlin saying things about ""unclarified processes"" though where Coughlindid say that revelation was a personal thing I noticed the strong Buddhist and idealistic feelingof Japhy, which he'd shared with goodhearted Coughlin in their buddy days at college, as Ihad shared mine with Alvah in the Eastern scene and with others less apocalyptical andstraighter but in no sense more sympathetic and tearful)."
14643,7,"  Meanwhile scores of people stood around in the darkened gallery straining to hear everyword of the amazing poetry reading as I wandered from group to group, facing them andfacing away from the stage, urging them to glug a slug from the jug, or wandered back and saton the right side of the stage giving out little wows and yesses of approval and even wholesentences of comment with nobody's invitation but in the general gaiety nobody's disapprovaleither."
14644,7,It was a great night.
14645,7,"Delicate Francis DaPavia read, from delicate onionskin, yellowpages, or pink, which he kept flipping carefully with long white fingers, the poems of his deadchum Altman who'd eaten too much peyote in Chihuahua (or died of polio, one) but read noneof his own poems—a charming elegy in itself to the memory of the dead young poet, enoughto draw tears from the Cervantes of Chapter Seven, and read them in a delicate Englishy voicethat had me crying with inside laughter though I later got to know Francis and liked him."
14646,7,"  Among the people standing in the audience was Rosie Buchanan, a girl with a shorthaircut, red-haired, bony, handsome, a real gone chick and friend of everybody of anyconsequence on the Beach, who'd been a painter's model and a writer herself and wasbubbling over with excitement at that time because she was in love with my old buddy Cody.""Great, hey Rosie?"" I yelled, and she took a big slug from my jug and shined eyes at me.Cody just stood behind her with both arms around her waist."
14647,7,"Between poets, RheinholdCacoethes, in his bow tie and shabby old coat, would get up and make a little funny speech inhis snide funny voice and introduce the next reader; but as I say come eleven-thirty when allthe poems were read and everybody was milling around wondering what had happened andwhat would come next in American poetry, he was wiping his eyes with his handkerchief.And we all got together with him, the poets, and drove in several cars to Chinatown for a bigfabulous dinner off the Chinese menu, with chopsticks, yelling conversation in the middle ofthe night in one of those free-swinging great Chinese restaurants of San Francisco."
14648,7,"Thishappened to be Japhy's favorite Chinese restaurant, Nam Yuen, and he showed me how toorder and how to eat with chopsticks and told anecdotes about the Zen Lunatics of the Orientand had me going so glad (and we had a bottle of wine on the table) that finally I went over toan old cook in the doorway of the kitchen and asked him ""Why did Bodhidharma come fromthe West?"" (Bodhidharma was the Indian who brought Buddhism eastward to China.)   ""I don't care,"" said the old cook, with lidded eyes, and I told Japhy and he said, ""Perfectanswer, absolutely perfect."
14649,7,"Now you know what I mean by Zen.""10  I had a lot more to learn, too."
14650,7,"Especially about how to handle girls—Japhy's incomparableZen Lunatic way, which I got a chance to see firsthand the following week.  11   3In Berkeley I was living with Alvah Goldbook in his little rose-covered cottage in thebackyard of a bigger house on Milvia Street."
14651,7,"The old rotten porch slanted forward to theground, among vines, with a nice old rocking chair that I sat in every morning to read myDiamond Sutra."
14652,7,"The yard was full of tomato plants about to ripen, and mint, mint, everythingsmelling of mint, and one fine old tree that I loved to sit under and meditate on those coolperfect starry California October nights unmatched anywhere in the world."
14653,7,"We had a perfectlittle kitchen with a gas stove, but no icebox, but no matter."
14654,7,"We also had a perfect littlebathroom with a tub and hot water, and one main room, covered with pillows and floor matsof straw and mattresses to sleep on, and books, books, hundreds of books everything fromCatullus to Pound to Blyth to albums of Bach and Beethoven (and even one swinging EllaFitzgerald album with Clark Terry very interesting on trumpet) and a good three-speedWebcor phonograph that played loud enough to blast the roof off: and the roof nothing butplywood, the walls too, through which one night in one of our Zen Lunatic drunks I put myfist in glee and Coughlin saw me and put his head through about three inches."
14655,7,"About a milefrom there, way down Milvia and then upslope toward the campus of the University ofCalifornia, behind another big old house on a quiet street (Hillegass), Japhy lived in his ownshack which was infinitely smaller than ours, about twelve by twelve, with nothing in it buttypical Japhy appurtenances that showed his belief in the simple monastic life—no chairs atall, not even one sentimental rocking chair, but just straw mats."
14656,7,In the corner was his famousrucksack with cleaned-up pots and pans all fitting into one another in a compact unit and alltied and put away inside a knotted-up blue bandana.
14657,7,"Then his Japanese wooden pata shoes,which he never used, and a pair of black inside-pata socks to pad around softly in over hispretty straw mats, just room for your four toes on one side and your big toe on the other."
14658,7,"Hehad a slew of orange crates all filled with beautiful scholarly books, some of them in Orientallanguages, all the great sutras, comments on sutras, the complete works of D."
14659,7,T.
14660,7,Suzuki and afine quadruple-volume edition of Japanese haikus.
14661,7,He also had an immense collection ofvaluable general poetry.
14662,7,In fact if a thief should have broken in there the only things of realvalue were the books.
14663,7,"Japhy's clothes were all old hand-me-downs bought secondhand with abemused and happy expression in Goodwill and Salvation Army stores: wool socks darned,colored undershirts, jeans, workshirts, moccasin shoes, and a few turtleneck sweaters that hewore one on top the other in the cold mountain nights of the High Sierras in California and theHigh Cascades of Washington and Oregon on the long incredible jaunts that sometimes lastedweeks and weeks with just a few pounds of dried food in his pack."
14664,7,"A few orange crates madehis table, on which, one late sunny afternoon as I arrived, was steaming a peaceful cup of teaat his side as he bent his serious head to the Chinese signs of the poet Han Shan."
14665,7,"Coughlin hadgiven me the address and I came there, seeing first Japhy's bicycle on the lawn in front of thebig house out front (where his landlady lived) then the few odd boulders and rocks and funnylittle trees he'd brought back from mountain jaunts to set out in his own ""Japanese tea garden""or ""tea-house garden,"" as there was a convenient pine tree soughing over his little domicile.A peacefuler scene I never saw than when, in that rather nippy late red afternoon, I simplyopened his little door and looked in and saw him at the end of the little shack, sitting cross-legged on a Paisley pillow on a straw mat, with his spectacles on, making him look old andscholarly and wise, with book on lap and the little tin teapot and porcelain cup steaming at hisside."
14666,7,"He looked up very peacefully, saw who it was, said, ""Ray, come in,"" and bent his eyesagain to the script.""What you doing?""   12""Translating Han Shan's great poem called 'Cold Mountain' written a thousand years agosome of it scribbled on the sides of cliffs hundreds of miles away from any other livingbeings.""""Wow.""""When you come into this house though you've got to take your shoes off, see those strawmats, you can ruin 'em with shoes."" So I took my soft-soled blue cloth shoes off and laid themdutifully by the door and he threw me a pillow and I sat crosslegged along the little woodenboard wall and he offered me a cup of hot tea."
14667,7,"""Did you ever read the Book of Tea?"" said he.""No, what's that?""""It's a scholarly treatise on how to make tea utilizing all the knowledge of two thousandyears about tea-brewing."
14668,7,"Some of the descriptions of the effect of the first sip of tea, and thesecond, and the third, are really wild and ecstatic.""""Those guys got high on nothing, hey?""""Sip your tea and you'll see; this is good green tea."" It was good and I immediately feltcalm and warm."
14669,7,"""Want me to read you parts of this Han Shan poem? Want me to tell youabout Han Shan?""""Yeah.""""Han Shan you see was a Chinese scholar who got sick of the big city and the world andtook off to hide in the mountains.""""Say, that sounds like you.""""In those days you could really do that."
14670,7,He stayed in caves not far from a Buddhistmonastery in the T'ang Hsing district of T'ien Tai and his only human friend was the funnyZen Lunatic Shih-te who had a job sweeping out the monastery with a straw broom.
14671,7,Shih-tewas a poet too but he never wrote much down.
14672,7,"Every now and then Han Shan would comedown from Cold Mountain in his bark clothing and come into the warm kitchen and wait forfood, but none of the monks would ever feed him because he didn't want to join the order andanswer the meditation bell three times a day."
14673,7,"You see why in some of his utterances, like—listen and I'll look here and read from the Chinese,"" and I bent over his shoulder and watchedhim read from big wild crowtracks of Chinese signs: ""Climbing up Cold Mountain path, ColdMountain path goes on and on, long gorge choked with scree and boulders, wide creek andmist-blurred grass, moss is slippery though there's been no rain, pine sings but there's nowind, who can leap the world's ties and sit with me among white clouds?""""Wow.""""Course that's my own translation into English, you see there are five signs for each lineand I have to put in Western prepositions and articles and such.""""Why don't you just translate it as it is, five signs, five words? What's those first fivesigns?""""Sign for climbing, sign for up, sign for cold, sign for mountain, sign for path.""""Well then, translate it 'Climbing up Cold Mountain path.' """"Yeah, but what do you do with the sign for long, sign for gorge, sign for choke, sign foravalanche, sign for boulders?""""Where's that?""""That's the third line, would have to read 'Long gorge choke avalanche boulders.' """"Well that's even better!""""Well yeah, I thought of that, but I have to have this pass the approval of Chinese scholarshere at the university and have it clear in English.""""Boy what a great thing this is,"" I said looking around at the little shack, ""and you sittinghere so very quietly at this very quiet hour studying all alone with your glasses."
14674,7,.
14675,7,.
14676,7,".""""Ray what you got to do is go climb a mountain with me soon."
14677,7,"How would you like toclimb Matterhorn?""   13   ""Great! Where's that?""   ""Up in the High Sierras."
14678,7,We can go there with Henry Morley in his car and bring our packsand take off from the lake.
14679,7,"I could carry all the food and stuff we need in my rucksack andyou could borrow Alvah's small knapsack and carry extra socks and shoes and stuff.""   ""What's these signs mean?""   ""These signs mean that Han Shan came down from the mountain after many years roamingaround up there, to see his folks in town, says, 'Till recently I stayed at Cold Mountain, etcetera, yesterday I called on friends and family, more than half had gone to the YellowSprings,' that means death, the Yellow Springs, 'now morning I face my lone shadow, I can'tstudy with both eyes full of tears.' ""   ""That's like you too, Japhy, studying with eyes full of tears.""   ""My eyes aren't full of tears!""   ""Aren't they going to be after a long long time?""   ""They certainly will, Ray ."
14680,7,.
14681,7,.
14682,7,"and look here, 'In the mountains it's cold, it's always beencold not just this year,' see, he's real high, maybe twelve thousand or thirteen thousand feet ormore, way up there, and says, 'Jagged scarps always snowed in, woods in the dark ravinesspitting mist, grass is still sprouting at the end of June, leaves begin to fall in early August,and here am I high as a junkey—' ""   ""As a junkey!""   ""That's my own translation, he actually says here am I as high as the sensualist in the citybelow, but I made it modern and high translation.""   ""Great."" I wondered why Han Shan was Japhy's hero."
14683,7,"  ""Because,"" said he, ""he was a poet, a mountain man, a Buddhist dedicated to the principleof meditation on the essence of all things, a vegetarian too by the way though I haven't got onthat kick from figuring maybe in this modern world to be a vegetarian is to split hairs a littlesince all sentient beings eat what they can."
14684,7,"And he was a man of solitude who could take offby himself and live purely and true to himself.""   ""That sounds like you too.""   ""And like you too, Ray, I haven't forgotten what you told me about how you made it in thewoods meditating in North Carolina and all."" Japhy was very sad, subdued, I'd never seen himso quiet, melancholy, thoughtful his voice was as tender as a mother's, he seemed to betalking from far away to a poor yearning creature (me) who needed to hear his message hewasn't putting anything on he was in a bit of a trance."
14685,7,"  ""Have you been meditating today?""   ""Yeah I meditate first thing in the morning before breakfast and I always meditate a longtime in the afternoon unless I'm interrupted.""   ""Who interrupts you?""   ""Oh, people."
14686,7,"Coughlin sometimes, and Alvah came yesterday, and Rol Sturlason, and I gotthis girl comes over to play yabyum.""   ""Yabyum? What's that?""   ""Don't you know about yabyum, Smith? I'll tell you later."" He seemed to be too sad to talkabout yabyum, which I found out about a couple of nights later."
14687,7,"We talked a while longerabout Han Shan and poems on cliffs and as I was going away his friend Rol Sturlason, a tallblond good-looking kid, came in to discuss his coming trip to Japan with him."
14688,7,"This RolSturlason was interested in the famous Ryoanji rock garden of Shokokuji monastery in Kyoto,which is nothing but old boulders placed in such a way, supposedly mystically aesthetic, as tocause thousands of tourists and monks every year to journey there to stare at the boulders inthe sand and thereby gain peace of mind."
14689,7,I have never met such weird yet serious and earnestpeople.
14690,7,"I never saw Rol Sturlason again, he went to Japan soon after, but I can't forget what14he said about the boulders, to my question, ""Well who placed them in that certain way that'sso great?""   ""Nobody knows, some monk, or monks, long ago."
14691,7,But there is a definite mysterious formin the arrangement of the rocks.
14692,7,"It's only through form that we can realize emptiness."" Heshowed me the picture of the boulders in well-raked sand, looking like islands in the sea,looking as though they had eyes (declivities) and surrounded by a neatly screened andarchitectural monastery patio."
14693,7,"Then he showed me a diagram of the stone arrangement withthe projection in silhouette and showed me the geometrical logics and all, and mentioned thephrases ""lonely individuality"" and the rocks as ""bumps pushing into space,"" all meaning somekind of koan business I wasn't as much interested in as in him and especially in good kindJaphy who brewed more tea on his noisy gasoline primus and gave us added cups with almosta silent Oriental bow."
14694,7,"It was quite different from the night of the poetry reading. 15 4   But the next night, about midnight, Coughlin and I and Alvah got together and decided tobuy a big gallon jug of Burgundy and go bust in on Japhy in his shack."
14695,7,"  ""What's he doing tonight?"" I asked."
14696,7,"  ""Oh,"" says Coughlin, ""probably studying, probably screwing, we'll go see."" We bought thejug on Shattuck Avenue way down and went over and once more I saw his pitiful Englishbicycle on the lawn."
14697,7,"""Japhy travels around on that bicycle with his little knapsack on his backall up and down Berkeley all day,"" said Coughlin."
14698,7,"""He used to do the same thing at ReedCollege in Oregon."
14699,7,He was a regular fixture up there.
14700,7,"Then we'd throw big wine parties andhave girls and end up jumping out of windows and playing Joe College pranks all up anddown town.""   ""Gee, he's strange,"" said Alvah, biting his lip, in a mood of marvel, and Alvah himself wasmaking a careful interested study of our strange noisy-quiet friend."
14701,7,"We came in the little dooragain, Japhy looked up from his cross-legged study over a book, American poetry this time,glasses on, and said nothing but ""Ah"" in a strangely cultured tone."
14702,7,"We took off our shoes andpadded across the little five feet of straw to sit by him, but I was last with my shoes off, andhad the jug in my hand, which I turned to show him from across the shack, and from hiscross-legged position Japhy suddenly roared ""Yaaaaah!"" and leaped up into the air andstraight across the room to me, landing on his feet in a fencing position with a sudden daggerin his hand the tip of it just barely stabbing the glass of the bottle with a small distinct ""clink.""It was the most amazing leap I ever saw in my life, except by nutty acrobats, much like amountain goat, which he was, it turned out."
14703,7,"Also it reminded me of a Japanese Samuraiwarrior—the yelling roar, the leap, the position, and his expression of comic wrath his eyesbulging and making a big funny face at me."
14704,7,I had the feeling it was really a complaint againstour breaking in on his studies and against wine itself which would get him drunk and makehim miss his planned evening of reading.
14705,7,"But without further ado he uncapped the bottlehimself and took a big slug and we all sat cross-legged and spent four hours screaming newsat one another, one of the funniest nights."
14706,7,"Some of it went like this:   japhy: Well, Coughlin, you old fart, what you been doin?   coughlin: Nothin."
14707,7,"  alvah: What are all these strange books here? Hm, Pound, do you like Pound?   japhy: Except for the fact that that old fartface flubbed up the name of Li Po by calling himby his Japanese name and all such famous twaddle, he was all right—in fact he's my favoritepoet."
14708,7,"  ray: Pound? Who wants to make a favorite poet out of that pretentious nut?   japhy: Have some more wine, Smith, you're not making sense."
14709,7,"Who is your favorite poet,Alvah?   ray: Why don't somebody ask me my favorite poet, I know more about poetry than all ofyou put together."
14710,7,  japhy: Is that true?   alvah: It might be.
14711,7,"Haven't you seen Ray's new book of poems he just wrote in Mexico—""the wheel of the quivering meat conception turns in the void expelling tics, porcupines,elephants, people, stardusts, fools, nonsense ."
14712,7,.
14713,7,".""   ray: That's not it!   japhy: Speaking of meat, have you read the new poem of ..."
14714,7,"  Etc., etc., then finally disintegrating into a wild talkfest and yellfest and finally songfestwith people rolling on the floor in laughter and ending with Alvah and Coughlin and I goingstaggering up the quiet college street arm in arm singing ""Eli Eli"" at the top of our voices anddropping the empty jug right at our feet in a crash of glass, as Japhy laughed from his little  16door."
14715,7,"But we'd made him miss his evening of study and I felt bad about that, till the followingnight when he suddenly appeared at our little cottage with a pretty girl and came in and toldher to take her clothes off, which she did at once.   17   5This was in keeping with Japhy's theories about women and lovemaking."
14716,7,"I forgot tomention that the day the rock artist had called on him in the late afternoon, a girl had comeright after, a blonde in rubber boots and a Tibetan coat with wooden buttons, and in thegeneral talk she'd inquired about our plan to climb Mount Matterhorn and said ""Can I comewith ya?"" as she was a bit of a mountain climber herself.""Shore,"" said Japhy, in his funny voice he used for joking, a big loud deep imitation of alumberjack he knew in the Northwest, a ranger actually, old Burnie Byers, ""shore, come onwith us and we'll all screw ya at ten thousand feet"" and the way he said it was so funny andcasual, and in fact serious, that the girl wasn't shocked at all but somewhat pleased."
14717,7,"In thissame spirit he'd now brought this girl Princess to our cottage, it was about eight o'clock atnight, dark, Alvah and I were quietly sipping tea and reading poems or typing poems at thetypewriter and two bicycles came in the yard: Japhy on his, Princess on hers."
14718,7,Princess hadgray eyes and yellow hair and was very beautiful and only twenty.
14719,7,"I must say one thing abouther, she was sex mad and man mad, so there wasn't much of a problem in persuading her toplay yabyum."
14720,7,"""Don't you know about yabyum, Smith?"" said Japhy in his big booming voicestriding in in his boots holding Princess's hand."
14721,7,"""Princess and I come here to show ya, boy.""""Suits me,"" said I, ""whatever it is."" Also I'd known Princess before and had been madabout her, in the City, about a year ago."
14722,7,"It was just another wild coincidence that she hadhappened to meet Japhy and fallen in love with him and madly too, she'd do anything he said.Whenever people dropped in to visit us at the cottage I'd always put my red bandana over thelittle wall lamp and put out the ceiling light to make a nice cool red dim scene to sit and drinkwine and talk in."
14723,7,"I did this, and went to get the bottle out of the kitchen and couldn't believemy eyes when I saw Japhy and Alvah taking their clothes off and throwing them everywhichaway and I looked and Princess was stark naked, her skin white as snow when the redsun hits it at dusk, in the dim red light."
14724,7,"""What the hell,"" I said.""Here's what yabyum is, Smith,"" said Japhy, and he sat cross-legged on the pillow on thefloor and motioned to Princess, who came over and sat down on him facing him with her armsabout his neck and they sat like that saying nothing for a while."
14725,7,Japhy wasn't at all nervousand embarrassed and just sat there in perfect form just as he was supposed to do.
14726,7,"""This is whatthey do in the temples of Tibet."
14727,7,"It's a holy ceremony, it's done just like this in front ofchanting priests."
14728,7,"People pray and recite OMB Mani Pahdme Hum, which means Amen theThunderbolt in the Dark Void."
14729,7,"I'm the thunderbolt and Princess is the dark void, you see.""""But what's she thinking?"" I yelled almost in despair, I'd had such idealistic longings forthat girl in that past year and had conscience-stricken hours wondering if I should seduce herbecause she was so young and all.""Oh this is lovely,"" said Princess."
14730,7,"""Come on and try it.""""But I can't sit cross-legged like that."" Japhy was sitting in the full lotus position, it'scalled, with both ankles over both thighs."
14731,7,Alvah was sitting on the mattress trying to yank hisankles over his thighs to do it.
14732,7,Finally Japhy's legs began to hurt and they just tumbled overon the mattress where both Alvah and Japhy began to explore the territory.
14733,7,"I still couldn'tbelieve it.""Take your clothes off and join in, Smith!"" But on top of all that, the feelings aboutPrincess, I'd also gone through an entire year of celibacy based on my feeling that lust was thedirect cause of birth which was the direct cause of suffering and death and I had really no liecome to a point where I regarded lust as offensive and even cruel.""Pretty girls make graves,"" was my saying, whenever I'd had to turn my head aroundinvoluntarily to stare at the incomparable pretties of Indian Mexico."
14734,7,And the absence of activelust in me had also given me a new peaceful life that I was enjoying a great deal.
14735,7,But this was18too much.
14736,7,"I was still afraid to take my clothes off; also I never liked to do that in front of morethan one person, especially with men around."
14737,7,"But Japhy didn't give a goddamn hoot andholler about any of this and pretty soon he was making Princess happy and then Alvah had aturn (with his big serious eyes staring in the dim light, and him reading poems a minute ago).So I said ""How about me startin to work on her arm?""""Go ahead, great."" Which I did, lying down on the floor with all my clothes on and kissingher hand, then her wrist, then up, to her body, as she laughed and almost cried with delighteverybody everywhere working on her."
14738,7,All the peaceful celibacy of my Buddhism was goingdown the drain.
14739,7,"""Smith, I distrust any kind of Buddhism or any kinda philosophy or socialsystem that puts down sex,"" said Japhy quite scholarly now that he was done and sitting nakedcross-legged rolling himself a Bull Durham cigarette (which he did as part of his ""simplicity""life)."
14740,7,"It ended up with everybody naked and finally making gay pots of coffee in the kitchenand Princess on the kitchen floor naked with her knees clasped in her arms, lying on her side,just for nothing, just to do it, then finally she and I took a warm bath together in the bathtuband could hear Alvah and Japhy discussing Zen Free Love Lunacy orgies in the other room.""Hey Princess we'll do this every Thursday night, hey?"" yelled Japhy."
14741,7,"""It'll be a regularfunction.""""Yeah,"" yelled Princess from the bathtub."
14742,7,"I'm telling you she was actually glad to do allthis and told me ""You know, I feel like I'm the mother of all things and I have to take care ofmy little children.""""You're such a young pretty thing yourself.""""But I'm the old mother of earth."
14743,7,"I'm a Bodhisattva."" She was just a little off her nut butwhen I heard her say ""Bodhisattva"" I realized she wanted to be a big Buddhist like Japhy andbeing a girl the only way she could express it was this way, which had its traditional roots inthe yabyum ceremony of Tibetan Buddhism, so everything was fine.Alvah was immensely pleased and was all for the idea of ""every Thursday night"" and sowas I by now.""Alvah, Princess says she's a Bodhisattva.""""Of course she is.""""She says she's the mother of all of us.""""The Bodhisattva women of Tibet and parts of ancient India,"" said Japhy, ""were taken andused as holy concubines in temples and sometimes in ritual caves and would get to lay up astock of merit and they meditated too."
14744,7,"All of them, men and women, they'd meditate, fast,have balls like this, go back to eating, drinking, talking, hike around, live in viharas in therainy season and outdoors in the dry, there was no question of what to do about sex which iswhat I always liked about Oriental religion."
14745,7,And what I always dug about the Indians in ourcountry .
14746,7,.
14747,7,.
14748,7,"You know when I was a little kid in Oregon I didn't feel that I was an American atall, with all that suburban ideal and sex repression and general dreary newspaper graycensorship of all our real human values but and when I discovered Buddhism and all Isuddenly felt that I had lived in a previous lifetime innumerable ages ago and now because offaults and sins in that lifetime I was being degraded to a more grievous domain of existenceand my karma was to be born in America where nobody has any fun or believes in anything,especially freedom."
14749,7,"That's why I was always sympathetic to freedom movements, too, likeanarchism in the Northwest, the old-time heroes of Everett Massacre and all."
14750,7,.
14751,7,.
14752,7,"."" It ended upwith long earnest discussions about all these subjects and finally Princess got dressed andwent home with Japhy on their bicycles and Alvah and I sat facing each other in the dim redlight.""But you know, Ray, Japhy is really sharp—he's really the wildest craziest sharpest catwe've ever met."
14753,7,"And what I love about him is he's the big hero of the West Coast, do yourealize I've been out here for two years now and hadn't met anybody worth knowing really or  19anybody with any truly illuminated intelligence and was giving up hope for the West Coast?Besides all the background he has, in Oriental scholarship, Pound, taking peyote and seeingvisions, his mountain climbing and bhikkuing, wow, Japhy Ryder is a great new hero ofAmerican culture.""""He's mad!"" I agreed."
14754,7,"""And other things I like about him, his quiet sad moments when hedon't say much."
14755,7,.
14756,7,.
14757,7,".""""Gee, I wonder what will happen to him in the end.""""I think he'll end up like Han Shan living alone in the mountains and writing poems on thewalls of cliffs, or chanting them to crowds outside his cave.""""Or maybe he'll go to Hollywood and be a movie star, you know he said that the other day,he said 'Alvah you know I've never thought of going to the movies and becoming a star, I cando anything you know, I haven't tried that yet,' and I believe him, he can do anything."
14758,7,"Did yousee the way he had Princess all wrapped around Mm?""""Aye indeed"" and later that night as Alvah slept I sat under the tree in the yard and lookedup at the stars or closed my eyes to meditate and tried to quiet myself down back to mynormal self.Alvah couldn't sleep and came out and lay flat on his back in the grass looking up at thesky, and said ""Big steamy clouds going by in the dark up there, it makes me realize we live onan actual planet.""""Close your eyes and you'll see more than that.""""Oh I don't know what you mean by all that!"" he said pettishly."
14759,7,"He was always beingbugged by my little lectures on Samadhi ecstasy, which is the state you reach when you stopeverything and stop your mind and you actually with your eyes closed see a kind of eternalmultiswarm of electrical Power of some kind ululating in place of just pitiful images andforms of objects, which are, after all, imaginary."
14760,7,And if you don't believe me come back in abillion years and deny it.
14761,7,"For what is time? ""Don't you think it's much more interesting just tobe like Japhy and have girls and studies and good times and really be doing something, thanall this silly sitting under trees?""""Nope,"" I said, and meant it, and I knew Japhy would agree with me."
14762,7,"""All Japhy's doing isamusing himself in the void.""""I don't think so."" ""I bet he is."
14763,7,"I'm going mountain climbing with him next week and find out and tell you.""""Well"" (sigh), ""as for me, I'm just going to go on being Alvah Goldbook and to hell withall this Buddhist bullshit.""""You'll be sorry some day."
14764,7,"Why don't you ever understand what I'm trying to tell you: it'swith your six senses that you're fooled into believing not only that you have six senses, butthat you contact an actual outside world with them."
14765,7,"If it wasn't for your eyes, you wouldn'tsee me."
14766,7,"If it wasn't for your ears, you wouldn't hear that airplane."
14767,7,"If it wasn't for your nose,you wouldn't smell the midnight mint."
14768,7,"If it wasn't for your tongue taster, you wouldn't tastethe difference between A and B."
14769,7,"If it wasn't for your body, you wouldn't feel Princess."
14770,7,"Thereis no me, no airplane, no mind, no Princess, no nothing, you for krissakes do you want to goon being fooled every damn minute of your life?""""Yes, that's all I want, I thank God that something has come out of nothing.""""Well, I got news for you, it's the other way around nothing has come out of something,and that something is Dharmakaya, the body of the True Meaning, and that nothing is this andall this twaddle and talk."
14771,7,"I'm going to bed.""""Well sometimes I see a flash of illumination in what you're trying to say but believe me Iget more of a satori out of Princess than out of words.""""It's a satori of your foolish flesh, you lecher.""""I know my redeemer liveth.""  20   ""What redeemer and what liveth?""   ""Oh let's cut this out and just live!""

""That's not nice."
14772,7,Everybody's tearful and trying to live with what they got.
14773,7,"Your Buddhismhas made you mean Ray and makes you even afraid to take your clothes off for a simplehealthy orgy.""   ""Well, I did finally, didn't I?""   ""But you were coming on so ninety about— Oh let's forget it.""   Alvah went to bed and I sat and closed my eyes and thought ""This thinking has stopped""but because I had to think it no thinking had stopped, but there did come over me a wave ofgladness to know that all this perturbation was just a dream already ended and I didn't have toworry because I wasn't ""I"" and I prayed that God, or Tathagata, would give me enough timeand enough sense and strength to be able to tell people what I knew (as I can't even doproperly now) so they'd know what I know and not despair so much."
14774,7,"The old tree broodedover me silently, a living thing."
14775,7,I heard a mouse snoring in the garden weeds.
14776,7,The rooftops ofBerkeley looked like pitiful living meat sheltering grieving phantoms from the eternality ofthe heavens which they feared to face.
14777,7,By the time I went to bed I wasn't taken in by noPrincess or no desire for no Princess and nobody's disapproval and I felt glad and slept well.21 6Now came the time for our big mountain climb.
14778,7,Japhy came over in late afternoon on hisbike to get me.
14779,7,We took out Alvah's knapsack and put it in his bike basket.
14780,7,I took out socksand sweaters.
14781,7,"But I had no climbing shoes and the only things that could serve were Japhy'stennis sneakers, old but firm."
14782,7,My own shoes were too floppy and torn.
14783,7,"""That might be better,Ray, with sneakers your feet are light and you can jump from boulder to boulder with notrouble."
14784,7,"Of course we'll swap shoes at certain times and make it.""""What about food? What are you bringing?"" ""Well before I tell you about food, R-a-a-y""(sometimes he called me by my first name and always when he did so, it was a long-drawn-out sad ""R-a-a-a-y"" as though he was worried about my welfare), ""I've got your sleeping bag,it's not a duck down like my own, and naturally a lot heavier, but with clothes on and a goodbig fire you'll be comfortable up there.""""Clothes on yeah, but why a big fire, it's only October."" ""Yeah but it's below freezing upthere, R-a-a-y, in October,"" he said sadly."
14785,7,"""At night?""""Yeah at night and in the daytime it's real warm and pleasant."
14786,7,"You know old John Muirused to go up to those mountains where we're going with nothing but his old Army coat and apaper bag full of dried bread and he slept in his coat and just soaked the old bread in waterwhen he wanted to eat, and he roamed around like that for months before tramping back to thecity.""""My goodness he musta been tough!""""Now as for food, I went down to Market Street to the Crystal Palace market and boughtmy favorite dry cereal, bulgur, which is a kind of a Bulgarian cracked rough wheat and I'mgoing to stick pieces of bacon in it, little square chunks, that'll make a fine supper for all threeof us, Morley and us."
14787,7,"And I'm bringing tea, you always want a good cup of hot tea underthose cold stars."
14788,7,"And I'm bringing real chocolate pudding, not that instant phony stuff butgood chocolate pudding that I'll bring to a boil and stir over the fire and then let it cool icecold in the snow.""""Oh boy!""""So insteada rice this time, which I usually bring, 1 thought I'd make a nice delicacy foryou, R-a-a-y, and in the bulgur too I'm going to throw in all kinds of dried diced vegetables Ibought at the Ski Shop."
14789,7,"We'll have our supper and breakfast outa this, and for energy food thisbig bag of peanuts and raisins and another bag with dried apricot and dried prunes oughta fixus for the rest."" And he showed me the very tiny bag in which all this important food for threegrown men for twenty-four hours or more climbing at high altitudes was stored."
14790,7,"""The mainthing in going to mountains is to keep the weight as far down as possible, those packs getheavy.""""But my God there's not enough food in that little bag!""""Yes there is, the water swells it up.""""Do we bring wine?""""No it isn't any good up there and once you're at high altitude and tired you don't cravealcohol."" I didn't believe this but said nothing."
14791,7,We put my own things on the bike and walkedacross the campus to his place pushing the bike along the edge of the sidewalk.
14792,7,"It was a coolclear Arabian Night dusk with the tower clock of University of Cal a clean black shadowagainst a backdrop of cypress and eucalyptus and all kinds of trees, bells ringing somewhere,and the air crisp."
14793,7,"""It's going to be cold up there,"" said Japhy, but he was feeling fine that nightand laughed when I asked him about next Thursday with Princess."
14794,7,"""You know we playedyabyum twice more since that last night, she comes over to my shack any day or night anyminute and man she won't take no for an answer."
14795,7,"So I satisfy the Bodhisattva."" And Japhywanted to talk about everything, his boyhood in Oregon."
14796,7,"""You know my mother and father   22and sister were living a real primitive life on that log cabin farm and on cold winter morningswe'd all undress and dress in front of the fire, we had to, that's why I'm not like you aboutundressing, I mean I'm not bashful or anything like that.""""What'd you use to do around college?""""In the summers I was always a government fire lookout— that's what you oughta do nextsummer, Smith—and in the winters I did a lot of skiing and used to walk .around the campuson crutches real proud."
14797,7,"I climbed some pretty big mountains up there, including a long haulup Rainier almost to the top where you sign your name."
14798,7,I finally made it one year.
14799,7,"There areonly a few names up there, you know."
14800,7,"And I climbed all around the Cascades, off season andin season, and worked as a logger."
14801,7,"Smith, I gotta tell you all about the romance of Northwestlogging, like you keep talking about railroading, you shoulda seen the little narrow-gaugerailways up there and those cold winter mornings with snow and your belly fulla pancakesand syrup and black coffee, boy, and you raise your doublebitted ax to your morning's firstlog there's nothing like it.""""That's just like my dream of the Great Northwest."
14802,7,"The Kwakiutl Indians, the NorthwestMounted Police."
14803,7,.
14804,7,.
14805,7,".""""Well, there in Canada they got them, over in British Columbia, I used to meet some on thetrail."" We pushed the bike down past the various college hangouts and cafeterias and lookedinto Robbie's to see if we knew anybody."
14806,7,"Alvah was in there, working his part-time job asbusboy."
14807,7,"Japhy and I were kind of outlandish-looking on the campus in our old clothes in factJaphy was considered an eccentric around the campus, which is the usual thing for campusesand college people to think whenever a real man appears on the scene—colleges beingnothing but grooming schools for the middle-class non-identity which usually finds its perfectexpression on the outskirts of the campus in rows of well-to-do houses with lawns andtelevision sets in each living room with everybody looking at the same thing and thinking thesame thing at the same time while the Japhies of the world go prowling in the wilderness tohear the voice crying in the wilderness, to find the ecstasy of the stars, to find the darkmysterious secret of the origin of faceless wonderless crapulous civilization."
14808,7,"""All thesepeople,"" said Japhy, ""they all got white-tiled toilets and take big dirty craps like bears in themountains, but it's all washed away to convenient supervised sewers and nobody thinks ofcrap any more or realizes that their origin is shit and civet and scum of the sea."
14809,7,"They spend allday washing their hands with creamy soaps they secretly wanta eat in the bathroom."" He hada million ideas, he had 'em all.We got to his little shack as it grew dark and you could smell woodsmoke and smoke ofleaves in the air, and packed everything up neat and went down the street to meet HenryMorley who had the car."
14810,7,"Henry Morley was a bespectacled fellow of great learning but aneccentric himself, more eccentric and outré than Japhy on the campus, a librarian, with fewfriends, but a mountain climber."
14811,7,"His own little one-room cottage in a back lawn of Berkeleywas filled with books and pictures of mountain climbing and scattered all over withrucksacks, climbing boots, skis."
14812,7,"I was amazed to hear him talk, he talked exactly likeRheinhold Cacoethes the critic, it turned out they'd been friends long ago and climbedmountains together and I couldn't tell whether Morley had influenced Cacoethes or the otherway around.I felt it was Morley who had done the influencing—he had the same snide, sarcastic,extremely witty, well-formulated speech, with thousands of images, like, when Japhy and Iwalked in and there was a gathering of Morley's friends in there (a strange outlandish groupincluding one Chinese and one German from Germany and several other students of somekind) Morley said ""I'm bringing my air mattress, you guys can sleep on that hard cold groundif you want but I'm going to have pneumatic aid besides I went and spend sixteen dollars on itin the wilderness of Oakland Army Navy stores and drove around all day wondering if with23roller-skates or suction cups you can technically call yourself a vehicle"" or some such to-me-incomprehensible (to everybody else) secret-meaning joke of his own, to which nobodylistened much anyway, he kept talking and talking as though to himself but I liked him rightaway."
14813,7,"We sighed when we saw the huge amounts of junk he wanted to take on the climb:even canned goods, and besides his rubber air mattress a whole lot of pickax and whatnotequipment we'd really never need.""You can carry that ax, Morley, but I don't think we'll need it, but canned goods is just a lotof water you have to hig on your back, don't you realize we got all the water we want waitinfor us up there?""""Well I just thought a can of this Chinese chop suey would be kinda tasty.""""I've got enough food for all of us."
14814,7,"Let's go.""Morley spent a long time talking and fishing around and getting together his unwieldypackboard and finally we said goodbye to his friends and got into Morley's little English carand started off, about ten o'clock, toward Tracy and up to Bridgeport from where we woulddrive another eight miles to the foot of the trail at the lake.I sat in the back seat and they talked up front."
14815,7,"Morley was an actual madman who wouldcome and get me (later) carrying a quart of eggnog expecting me to drink that, but I'd makehim drive me to a liquor store, and the whole idea was to go out and see some girl and he'dhave me come along to act as pacifier of some kind: we came to her door, she Opened it,when she saw who it was she slammed the door and we drove back to the cottage."
14816,7,"""Well whatwas this?"" ""Well it's a long story,"" Morley would say vaguely, I never quite understood whathe was up to."
14817,7,"Also, seeing Alvah had no spring bed in the cottage, one day he appeared like aghost in a doorway as we were innocently getting up and brewing coffee and presented uswith a huge double-bed spring that, after he left, we struggled to hide in the barn."
14818,7,"And he'dbring odd assorted boards and whatnot, and impossible bookshelves, all kinds of things, andyears later I had further Three Stooges adventures with him going out to his house in ContraCosta (which he owned and rented) and spending impossible-to-believe afternoons when hepaid me two dollars an hour for hauling out bucket after bucket of mudslime which he himselfwas doling out of a flooded cellar by hand, black and mud-covered as Tartarilouak the Kingof the Mudslimes of Paratioalaouakak Span, with a secret grin of elfish delight on his face;and later, returning through some little town and Wanting ice-cream cones, we walked downMain Street (had hiked on the highway with buckets and rakes) with ice-cream cones in ourhands knocking into people on the little sidewalks like a couple of old-time Hollywood silentfilm comedians, whitewash and all."
14819,7,"An extremely strange person anyway, in any case, any oldway you looked at, and drove the car now out toward Tracy on the busy four lanes highwayand did most of the talking, at everything Japhy said he had twelve to say, and it went likethis: Japhy would say something like ""By God I feel real studious lately, I think I'll read someornithology next week."" Morley would say, ""Who doesn't feel studious when he doesn't havea girl with a Riviera suntan?""Every time he said something he would turn and look at Japhy and deliver these ratherbrilliant inanities with a complete deadpan; I couldn't understand what kind of strange secretscholarly linguistic clown he really was under these California skies."
14820,7,"Or Japhy would mentionsleeping bags, and Morley would ramble in with ""I'm going to be the possessor of a pale blueFrench sleeping bag, light weight, goose down, good buy I think, find 'em in Vancouver—good for Daisy Mae."
14821,7,Completely wrong type for Canada.
14822,7,Everyone wants to know if hergrandfather was an explorer who met an Eskimo.
14823,7,"I'm from the North Pole myself.""""What's he talking about?"" I'd ask from the back seat, and Japhy: ""He's just an interestingtape recorder.""I'd told the boys I had a touch of thrombophlebitis, blood clots in the veins in my feet, andwas afraid about tomorrow's climb, not that it would hobble me but would get worse when we   24came down."
14824,7,"Morley said ""Is thrombophlebitis a peculiar rhythm for piss?"" Or I'd saysomething about Westerners and he'd say, ""I'm a dumb Westerner ."
14825,7,.
14826,7,.
14827,7,"look whatpreconceptions have done to England.""""You're crazy, Morley.""""I dunno, maybe I am, but if I am I'll leave a lovely will anyway."" Then out of nowhere hewould say ""Well I'm very pleased to go climbing with two poets, I'm going to write a bookmyself, it'll be about Ragusa, a late medieval maritime city state republic which solved theclass problem, offered the secretaryship to Machiavelli and for a generation had its languageused as the diplomatic one for the Levant."
14828,7,"This was because of pull with the Turks, ofcourse.""""Of course,"" we'd say.So he'd ask himself the question out loud: ""Can you secure Christmas with anapproximation only eighteen million seconds left of the original old red chimney?""""Sure,"" says Japhy laughing.""Sure,"" says Morley wheeling the car around increasing curves, ""they're boarding reindeerGreyhound specials for a pre-season heart-to-heart Happiness Conference deep in Sierrawilderness ten thousand five hundred and sixty yards from a primitive motel."
14829,7,It's newer thananalysis and deceptively simple.
14830,7,"If you lost the roundtrip ticket you can become a gnome, theoutfits are cute and there's a rumor that Actors Equity conventions sop up the overflowbounced from the Legion."
14831,7,"Either way, of course, Smith"" (turning to me in the back) ""and infinding your way back to the emotional wilderness you're bound to get a present from ."
14832,7,.
14833,7,.someone.
14834,7,"Will some maple syrup help you feel better?""""Sure, Henry.""And that was Morley."
14835,7,"Meanwhile the car began climbing into the foothills somewhere andwe came to sundry sullen towns where we stopped for gas and nothing but bluejeaned ElvisPresleys in the road, waiting to beat somebody up, but down beyond them the roar of freshcreeks and the feel of the high mountains not far away."
14836,7,"A pure sweet night, and finally we gotout on a real narrow tar country road and headed up toward the mountains for sure."
14837,7,Tall pinetrees began to appear at the side of the road and occasional rock cliffs.
14838,7,The air felt nippy andgrand.
14839,7,"This also happened to be the opening eve of the hunting season and in a bar where westopped for a drink there were many hunters in red caps and wool shirts looking silly gettingloaded, with all their guns and shells in their cars and eagerly asking us if we'd seen any deeror not."
14840,7,"We had, certainly, seen a deer, just before we came to the bar."
14841,7,"Morley had beendriving and talking, saying, ""Well Ryder maybe you'll be Alfred Lord Tennyson of our littletennis party here on the Coast, they'll call you the New Bohemian and compare you to theKnights of the Round Table minus Amadis the Great and the extraordinary splendors of thelittle Moorish kingdom that was sold round to Ethiopia for seventeen thousand camels andsixteen hundred foot soldiers when Caesar was sucking on his mammy's teat,"" and suddenlythe deer was in the road, looking at our head-lamps, petrified, before leaping into theshrubbery by the side of the road and disappearing into the sudden vast diamond silence of theforest (which we heard as Morley cut the motor) and just the scuffle of its hoofs running offto the haven of the raw fish Indian up there in the mists."
14842,7,"It was real country we were in,Morley said about three thousand feet now."
14843,7,We could hear creeks rushing coldly below oncold starlit rocks without seeing them.
14844,7,"""Hey little deer,"" I'd yelled to the animal, ""don't worry,we won't shoot you."" Now in the bar, where we'd stopped at my insistence (""In this kinda coldnorthern upmountain country ain't nothin better for a man's soul at midnight but a good warmglass of warmin red port heavy as the syrups of Sir Arthur"")— ""Okay Smith,"" said Japhy, ""butseems to me we shouldn't drink on a hiking trip.""""Ah who gives a damn?""   25""Okay, but look at all the money we saved by buying cheap dried foods for this weekendand all you're gonna do is drink it right down.""""That's the story of my life rich or poor and mostly poor and truly poor."" We went in thebar, which was a roadhouse ill done up in the upcountry mountain style, like a Swiss chalet,with moose heads and designs of deer on the booths and the people in the bar itself anadvertisement for the hunting season but all of them loaded, a weaving mass of shadows atthe dim bar as we walked in and sat at three stools and ordered the port."
14845,7,The port was astrange request in the whisky country of hunters but the bartender rousted up an odd bottle ofChristian Brothers port and poured us two shots in wide wineglasses (Morley a teetotaleractually) and Japhy and I drank and felt it fine.
14846,7,"""Ah,"" said Japhy warming up to his wine and midnight, ""soon I'm going back north to visitmy childhood wet woods and cloudy mountains and old bitter intellectual friends and olddrunken logger friends, by God, Ray you ain't lived till you been up there with me, or without.And then I'm going to Japan and walk all over that hilly country finding ancient little templeshidden and forgotten in the mountains and old Sages a hundred and nine years old praying toKwannon in huts and meditating so much that when they come out of meditation they laugh ateverything that moves."
14847,7,"But that don't mean I don't love America, by God, though I hate thesedamn hunters, all they wanta do is level a gun at a helpless sentient being and murder it, forevery sentient being or living creature these actual pricks kill they will be reborn a thousandtimes to suffer the horrors of samsara and damn good for 'em too.""""Hear that, Morley, Henry, what you think?""""My Buddhism is nothing but a mild unhappy interest in some of the pictures they'vedrawn though I must say sometimes Cacoethes strikes a nutty note of Buddhism in hismountain climbing poems though I'm not much interested in the belief part of it."" In fact itdidn't make a goddamn much of a difference to him."
14848,7,"""I'm neutral,"" said he, laughing happilywith a kind of an eager slaking leer, and Japhy yelled:""Neutral is what Buddhism is!""""Well, that port'll make you have to swear off yogurt."
14849,7,"You know I am a fortioridisappointed because there's no Benedictine or Trappist wine, only Christian Brothers holywaters and spirits around here."
14850,7,"Not that I feel very expansive about being here in this curiousbar anyway, it looks like the homeplate for Ciardi and Bread Loaf writers, Armenian grocersall of 'em, well-meaning awkward Protestants who are on a group excursion for a binge andwant to but don't understand how to insert the contraception."
14851,7,"These people must be assholes,""he added in a sudden straight revelation."
14852,7,"""The milk around here must be fine but more cowsthan people."
14853,7,"This must be a different race of Anglos up here, I don't particularly warm up totheir appearance."
14854,7,The fast kids around here must go thirty-four miles.
14855,7,"Well, Japhy,"" said he,concluding, ""if you ever get an official job I hope you get a Brooks Brothers suit ."
14856,7,.
14857,7,.
14858,7,"hope youdon't wind up in artsy fartsy parties where it would— Say,"" as some girls walked in, ""younghunters ."
14859,7,.
14860,7,.
14861,7,"must be why the baby wards are open all year.""But the hunters didn't like us to be huddled there talking close and friendly in low voicesabout sundry personal topics and joined us and pretty soon it was a long funny harangue upand down the oval bar about deer in the locality, where to go climb, what to do, and whenthey heard we were out in this country not to kill animals but just to climb mountains theytook us to be hopeless eccentrics and left as alone."
14862,7,"Japhy and I had two wines and felt fine andwent back in the car with Morley and we drove away, higher and higher, the trees taller, theair colder, climbing, till finally it was almost two o'clock in the morning and they said we hada long way to go yet to Bridgeport and the foot of the trail so we might as well sleep out inthese woods in our sleeping bags and call it a day."
14863,7,"""We'll get up at dawn and take off."
14864,7,"Meanwhile we have this good brown bread and cheesetoo,"" said Japhy producing it, brown bread and cheese he'd thrown in at the last minute in his   26little shack, ""and that'll make a fine breakfast and we'll save the bulgur and goodies for ourbreakfast tomorrow morning at ten thousand feet."" Fine."
14865,7,"Still talking and all, Morley drovethe car a little way over some hard pine needles under an immense spread of natural parktrees, firs and ponderosas a hundred feet high some of them, a great quiet starlit grove withfrost on the ground and dead silence except for occasional little ticks of sound in the thicketswhere maybe a rabbit stood petrified hearing us."
14866,7,"I got out my sleeping bag and spread it outand took off my shoes and just as I was sighing happily and slipping my stockinged feet intomy sleeping bag and looking around gladly at the beautiful tall trees thinking ""Ah what anight of true sweet sleep this will be, what meditations I can get into in this intense silence ofNowhere"" Japhy yelled at me from the car: ""Say, it appears Mr."
14867,7,"Morley has forgotten hissleeping bag!""""What ."
14868,7,.
14869,7,.
14870,7,"well now what?""They discussed it awhile fiddling with flashlights in the frost and then Japhy came overand said ""You'll have to crawl outa there Smith, all we have is two sleeping bags now andgotta zip 'em open and spread 'em out to form a blanket for three, goddammit that'll be cold.""""What? And the cold'll slip in around the bottoms!""""Well Henry can't sleep in that car, he'll freeze to death, no heater.""""But goddammit I was all ready to enjoy this so much,"" I whined getting out and putting onmy shoes and pretty soon Japhy had fixed the two sleeping bags on top of ponchos and wasalready settled down to sleep and on toss it was me had to sleep in the middle, and it was waybelow freezing by now, and the stars were icicles of mockery."
14871,7,"I got in and lay down andMorley, I could hear the maniac blowing up his ridiculous air mattress so he could lay besideme, but the moment he'd done so, he started at once to turn over and heave and sigh, andaround the other side, and back toward me, and around the other side, all under the ice-coldstars and loveliness, while Japhy snored, Japhy who wasn't subjected to all the mad wiggling.Finally Morley couldn't sleep at all and got up and went to the car probably to talk to himselfin that mad way of his and I got a wink of sleep, but in a few minutes he was back, freezing,and got under the sleeping-bag blanket but started to turn and turn again, even curse once in awhile, or sigh, and this."
14872,7,"THE CHURCH IS blowing a sad windblown “Kathleen” on the bells in the skid row slums as I wake up all woebegone and goopy, groaning from another drinking bout and groaning most of all because I’d ruined my “secret return” to San Francisco by getting silly drunk while hiding in the alleys with bums and then marching forth into North Beach to see everybody altho Lorenz Monsanto and I’d exchanged huge letters outlining how I would sneak in quietly, call him on the phone using a code name like Adam Yulch or Lalagy Pulvertaft (also writers) and then he would secretly drive me to his cabin in the Big Sur woods where I would be alone and undisturbed for six weeks just chopping wood, drawing water, writing, sleeping, hiking, etc., etc."
14873,7,"— But instead I’ve bounced drunk into his City Lights bookshop at the height of Saturday night business, everyone recognized me (even tho” I was wearing my disguise-like fisherman’s hat and fishermen coat and pants waterproof) and “t’all ends up a roaring drunk in all the famous bars the bloody “King of the Beatniks” is back in town buying drinks for everyone — Two days of that, including Sunday the day Lorenzo is supposed to pick me up at my “secret” skid row hotel (the Mars on 4th and Howard) but when he calls for me there’s no answer, he has the clerk open the door and what does he see but me out on the floor among bottles, Ben Fagan stretched out partly beneath the bed, and Robert Browning the beatnik painter out on the bed, snoring… So says to himself “I’ll pick him up next weekend, I guess he wants to drink for a week in the city (like he always does, I guess)” so off he drives to his Big Sur cabin without me thinking he’s doing the right thing but my God when I wake up, and Ben and Browning are gone, they’ve somehow dumped me on the bed, and I hear “I’ll Take You Home Again Kathleen” being bellroped so sad in the fog winds out there that blow across the rooftops of eerie old hangover Frisco, wow, I’ve hit the end of the trail and cant even drag my body any more even to a refuge in the woods let alone stay upright in the city a minute — It’s the first trip I’ve taken away from home (my mother’s house) since the publication of “Road” the book that “made me famous” and in fact so much so I’ve been driven mad for three years by endless telegrams, phone calls, requests, mail, visitors, reporters, snoopers (a big voice saying in my basement window as I prepare to write a story: ARE YOU BUSY? ) or the time the reporter ran upstairs to my bedroom as I sat there in my pajamas trying to write down a dream — Teenagers jumping the six- foot fence I’d had built around my yard for privacy — Parties with bottles yelling at my study window “Come on out and get drunk, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy! “… A woman coming to my door and saying “I’m not going to ask you if you’re Jack Duluoz because I know he wears a beard, can you tell me where I can find him, I want a real beatnik at my annual Shindig party” — Drunken visitors puking in my study, stealing books and even pencils… Uninvited acquaintances staying for days because of the clean beds and good food my mother provided… Me drunk practically all the time to put on a jovial cap to keep up with all this but finally realizing I was surrounded and outnumbered and had to get away to solitude again or die — So Lorenzo Monsanto wrote and said “Come to my cabin, no one’ll know, “ etc., so I had sneaked into San Francisco as I say, coming 3000 miles from my home in Long Island (Northport) in a pleasant roomette on the California Zephyr train watching America roll by outside my private picture window, really happy for the first time in three years, staying in the roomette all three days and three nights with my instant coffee and sandwiches — Up the Hudson Valley and over across New York State to Chicago and then the Plains, the mountains, the desert, the final mountains of California, all so easy and dreamlike compared to my old harsh hitch-hikings before I made enough money to take transcontinental trains (all over America high school and college kids thinking “Jack Duluoz is 26 years old and on the road all the time hitch hiking” while there I am almost 40 years old, bored and jaded in a roomette bunk crashing across that Salt Flat) — But in any case a wonderful start towards my retreat so generously offered by sweet old Monsanto and instead of going thru smooth and easy I wake up drunk, sick, disgusted, frightened, in fact terrified by that sad song across the roofs mingling with the lachrymose cries of a Salvation Army meeting on the corner below “Satan is the cause of your alcoholism, Satan is the cause of your immorality, Satan is everywhere workin to destroy you unless you repent now” and worse than that the sound of old drunks throwing up in rooms next to mine, the creak of hall steps, the moans everywhere Including the moan that had awakened me, my own moan in the lumpy bed, a moan caused by a big roaring Whoo Whoo in my head that had shot me out of my pillow like a ghost.2And I look around the dismal cell, there’s my hopeful rucksack all neatly packed with everything necessary to live in the woods, even unto the minutest first aid kit and diet details and even a neat little sewing kit cleverly reinforced by my good mother (like extra safety pins, buttons, special sewing needles, little aluminum scissors)… The hopeful medal of St Christopher even which she’d sewn on the flap… The survival kit all in there down to the last little survival sweater and handkerchief and tennis sneakers (for hiking) — But the rucksack sits hopefully in a strewn mess of bottles all empty, empty poor boys of white port, butts, junk, horror… “One fast move or I’m gone, “ I realize, gone the way of the last three years of drunken hopelessness which is a physical and spiritual and metaphysical hopelessness you cant learn in school no matter how many books on existentialism or pessimism you read, or how many jugs of vision producing Ayahuasca you drink, or Mescaline take, or Peyote goop up with — That feeling when you wake up with the delirium tremens with the fear of eerie death dripping from your ears like those special heavy cobwebs spiders weave in the hot countries, the feeling of being a bent back mudman monster groaning underground in hot steaming mud pulling a long hot burden nowhere, the feeling of standing ankledeep in hot boiled pork blood, ugh, of being up to your waist in a giant pan of greasy brown dishwater not a trace of suds left in it… The face of yourself you see in the mirror with its expression of unbearable anguish so haggard and awful with sorrow you cant even cry for a thing so ugly, so lost, no connection whatever with early perfection and therefore nothing to connect with tears or anything: it’s like William Seward Burroughs” “Stranger” suddenly appearing in your place in the mirror — Enough! “One fast move or I’m gone” so I jump up, do my headstand first to pump blood back into the hairy brain, take a shower in the hall, new T-shirt and socks and underwear, pack vigorously, hoist the rucksack and run out throwing the key on the desk and hit the cold street and walk fast to the nearest little grocery store to buy two days of food, stick it in the rucksack, hike thru lost alleys of Russian sorrow where bums sit head on knees in foggy doorways in the goopy eerie city night I’ve got to escape or die, and into the bus station In a half hour into a bus seat, the bus says “Monterey” and off we go down the clean neon hiway and I sleep all the way, waking up amazed and well again smelling sea air the bus driver shaking me “End of the line, Monterey."
14874,7,"“ — And by God it is Monterey, I stand sleepy in the 2 A."

14876,7,seeing vague little fishing masts across the street from the bus driveway.
14877,7,"Now all I’ve got to do to complete my escape is get 14 miles down the coast to the Raton Canyon bridge and hike in.3“ONE FAST MOVE or I’m gone” so I blow $8 on a cab to drive me down that coast, it’s foggy night tho sometimes you can see stars in the sky to the right where the sea is, tho you cant see the sea you can only hear about it from the cabdriver— “What kinda country is it around here? I’ve never seen it."
14878,7,"“ ‘Well, you cant see it tonight — Raton Canyon you say, you better be careful walkin' around there in the dark."
14879,7,"“ ‘Why?”“Well, just use your lamp like you say…”And sure enough when he lets me off at the Raton Canyon bridge and counts the money I sense something wrong somehow, there’s an awful roar of surf but it isn't coming from the right place, like you’d expect it to come from “over there” but it’s coming from “under there” — I can see the bridge but I can see nothing below it — The bridge continues the coast highway from one bluff to another, it’s a nice white bridge with white rails and there’s a white line runnin' down the middle familiar and highway like but something’s wrong — Besides the headlights of the cab just shoot out over a few bushes into empty space in the direction where the canyon’s supposed to be, it feels like being up in the air somewhere tho I can see the dirt road at our feet and the dirt overhang on the side“What in the hell is this? “ — I’ve got the directions all memorized from a little map Monsanto’s mailed me but in my imagination dreaming about this big retreat back home there’d been something larkish, bucolic, all homely woods and gladness instead of all this aerial roaring mystery in the dark — When the cab leaves I therefore turn on my railroad lantern for a timid peek but its beam gets lost just like the car lights in a void and in fact the battery is fairly weak and I can hardly see the bluff at my left — As for the bridge I cant see it anymore except for graduating series of luminous shoulder buttons going off further into the low sea roar… The sea roar is bad enough except it keeps bashing and barking at me like a dog in the fog down there, sometimes it booms the earth but my God where is the earth and how can the sea be underground!— “The only thing to do, “ I gulp, “is to put this lantern shinin' right in front of your feet, kiddo, and follow that lantern and make sure it’s shinin' on the road rut and hope and pray it’s shinin' on the ground that’s gonna be there when it’s shinin', “ in other words I actually fear that even my lamp will carry me astray if I dare to raise it for a minute from the ruts in the dirt road — The only satisfaction I can glean from this roaring high horror of darkness is that the lamp wobbles huge dark shadows of its little rim stays on the overhanging bluff at the left of the road, because to the right (where the bushes are wiggling in the wind from the sea) there ain't no shadows because there ain't no light can take hold — So I start my trudge, pack aback, just head down following my lamp spot, head down but eyes suspiciously peering a little up, like a man in the presence of a dangerous idiot he doesn’t want to annoy The dirt road starts up a little, curves to the right, starts down a little, then suddenly up again, and up By now the sea roar is further back and at one point I even stop and look back to see nothing— “I’m gonna put out my light and see what I can see” I stay rooted to my feet where they’re rooted to that road Fat lotta good, when I put out the light I see nothing but the dim sand at my feet."
14880,7,"Trudging up and getting further away from the sea roar I get to feel more confident but suddenly I come to a frightening thing in the road, I stop and hold out my hand, edge forward, it’s only a cattle crossing (iron bars imbedded across the road) but at the same time a big blast of wind comes from the left where the bluff should be and I spot that way and see nothing."
14881,7,"“What the hell’s going on! “ “Fol-low the road, “ says the other voice trying to be calm so I do but the next instant I hear a rattling to my right, throw my light there, see nothing but bushes wiggling dry and mean and just the proper high canyonwall kind of bushes fit for rattlesnakes too — (which it was, a rattlesnake doesnt like to be awakened in the middle of the night by a trudging humpback monster with a lamp)."
14882,7,"But now the road’s going down again, the reassuring bluff reappears on my left, and pretty soon according to my memory of Lorry’s map there she is, the creek, I can hear her lappling and gabbing down there at the bottom of the dark where at least I’ll be on level ground and done with booming airs somewhere above — But the closer I get to the creek as the road dips steeply, suddenly, almost making me trot forward, the louder it roars, I begin to think I’ll fall right into it before I can notice it… It’s screaming like a raging flooded river right below me — Besides it’s even darker down there than anywhere! There are glades down there, ferns of horror and slippery logs, mosses, dangerous plashings, humid mists rise coldly like the breath of death, big dangerous trees are beginning to bend over my head and brush my pack — There’s a noise I know can only grow louder as I sink down and for fear how loud it can grow I stop and listen, it rises up crashing mysteriously at me from a raging battle among dark things, wood or rock or something cracked, all smashed, all wet black sunken earth danger — I’m afraid to go down there — I am affrayed in the old Edmund Spenser sense of being frayed by a whip, and a wet one at that — A slimy green dragon racket in the bush — An angry war that doesnt want me pokin around — It’s been there a million years and it doesnt want me clashing darkness with it — It comes snarling from a thousand crevasses and monster redwood roots all over the map of creation — It is a dark clangoror in the rain forest and doesnt want no skid row bum to carry to the sea which is bad enough and waitin back there — I can almost feel the sea pulling at that racket in the trees but there’s my spotlamp so all I gotta do is follow the lovely sand road which dips and dips in rising carnage and suddenly a flattening, a sight of bridge logs, there’s the bridge rail, there’s the creek just four feet below, cross the bridge you woken bum and see what’s on the other shore."
14883,7,"Take one quick peek at the water as you cross, just water over rocks, a small creek at that.And now before me is a dreamy meadowland with a good old corral gate and a barbed wire fence the road running right on left but this where I get off at last."
14884,7,"Then I crawl thru the barbed wire and find myself trudging a sweet little sand road winding right thru fragrant dry heathers as tho I’d just popped thru from hell into familiar old Heaven on Earth, yair and Thank God (tho a minute later my heart’s in my mouth again because I see black things in the white sand ahead but it’s only piles of good old mule dung in Heaven).4AND IN THE morning (after sleeping by the creek in the white sand) I do see what was so scary about my canyon road walk — The road’s up there on the wall a thousand feet with a sheer drop sometimes, especially at the cattle crossing, way up highest, where a break in the bluff shows fog pouring through from another bend of the sea beyond, scary enough in itself anyway as tho one hole wasnt enough to open into the sea… And worst of all is the bridge! I go ambling seaward along the path by the creek and see this awful thin white line of bridge a thousand unbridgeable sighs of height above the little woods I’m walking in, you just cant believe it, and to make things heart-thumpingly horrible you come to a little bend in what is now just a trail and there’s the booming surf coming at you whitecapped crashing down on sand as tho it was higher than where you stand, like a sudden tidal wave world enough to make you step back or run back to the hills — And not only that, the blue sea behind the crashing high waves is full of huge black rocks rising like old ogresome castles dripping wet slime, a billion years of woe right there, the moogrus big clunk of it right there with its slaverous lips of foam at the base — So that you emerge from pleasant little wood paths with a stem of grass in your teeth and drop it to see doom… And you look up at that unbelievably high bridge and feel death and for a good reason: because underneath the bridge, in the sand right beside the sea cliff, hump, your heart sinks to see it: the automobile that crashed thru the bridge rail a decade ago and fell 1000 feet straight down and landed upside-down, is still there now, an upside-down chassis of rust in a strewn skitter of sea-eaten tires, old spokes, old car seats sprung with straw, one sad fuel pump and no more people…Big elbows of Rock rising everywhere, sea caves within them, seas plollocking all around inside them crashing out foams, the boom and pound on the sand, the sand dipping quick (no Malibu Beach here) — Yet you turn and see the pleasant woods winding upcreek like a picture in Vermont — But you look up into the sky, bend way back, my God you’re standing directly under the aerial bridge with its thin white line running from rock to rock and witless cars racing across it like dreams! From rock to rock! All the way down the raging coast! So that when later I heard people say “Oh Big Sur must be beautiful! “ I gulp to wonder why it has the reputation of being beautiful above and beyond its fearfulness, its Blakean groaning roughrock Creation throes, those vistas when you drive the coast highway on a sunny day opening up the eye for miles of horrible washing sawing.5IT WAS EVEN frightening at the other peaceful end of Raton Canyon, the east end, where Alf the pet mule of local settlers slept at night such sleepfull sleeps under a few weird trees and then got up in the morning to graze in the grass then negotiated the whole distance slowly to the sea shore where you saw him standing by the waves like an ancient sacred myth character motionless in the sand — Alf the Sacred Burro” I later called him — The thing that was frightening was the mountain that rose up at the east end, a strange Burmese like mountain with levels and moody terraces and a strange ricepaddy hat on top that I kept staring at with a sinking heart even at first when I was healthy and feeling good (and I would be going mad in this canyon in six weeks on the fullmoon night of 3 September) — The mountain reminded me of my recent recurrent nightmares in New York about the “Mountain of Mien Mo” with the swarms of moony flying horses lyrically sweeping capes over their shoulders as they circled the peak a “thousand miles high” (in the dream it said) and on top of the mountain in one haunted nightmare I’d seen the giant empty stone benches so silent in the topworld moonlight as tho once inhabited by Gods or giants of some kind but long ago vacated so that they were all dusty and cobwebby now and the evil lurked somewhere inside the pyramid nearby where there was a monster with a big thumping heart but also, even more sinister, just ordinary seedy but muddy janitors cooking over small woodfires… Narrow dusty holes through which I’d tried to crawl with a bunch of tomato plants tied around my neck — Dreams — Drinking nightmares — A recurrent series of them all swirling around that mountain, seen the very first time as a beautiful but somehow horribly green verdant mist enshrouded jungle peak rising out of green tropical country in ‘Mexico” so called but beyond which were pyramids, dry rivers, other countries full of infantry enemy and yet the biggest danger being just hoodlums out throwing rocks on Sundays — So that the sight of that simple sad mountain, together with the bridge and that car that had flipped over twice or so and landed flump in the sand with no more sign of human elbows or shred neckties (like a terrifying poem about America you could write), agh, HOO HOO of Owls living in old evil hollow trees in that misty tangled further part of the canyon where I was always afraid to go anyhow — That unclimbably tangled steep cliff at the base of Mien Mo rising to gawky dead trees among bushes so dense and up to heathers God knows how deep with hidden caves no one not even I spose the Indians of the roth century had ever explored — And those big gooky rainforest ferns among lightningstruck conifers right beside sudden black vine cliff faces rising right at your side as you walk the peaceful path… And as I say that ocean coming at you higher than you are like the harbors of old woodcuts always higher than the towns (as Rimbaud pointed out shuddering) — So many evil combinations even unto the bat who would come at me later while I slept on the outdoor cot on the porch of Lorenzo’s cabin, come circle my head coming real low sometimes filling me with the traditional fear it’ll get tangled in my hair, and such silent wings, how would you like to wake up in the middle of the night and see silent wings beating over you and you ask yourself “Do I really believe in Vampires? “… In fact, flying silently around my lamplit cabin at 3 o’clock in the morning as I’m reading (of all things) (shudder) Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde — Small wonder maybe that I myself turned from serene Jekyll to hysterical Hyde in the short space of six weeks, losing absolute control of the peace mechanisms of my mind for the first time in my life.But Ah, at first there were fine days and nights, right after Monsanto drove me to Monterey and back with two boxes of a full grub list and left me there alone for three weeks of solitude, as we’d agreed — So fearless and happy I even spotted his powerful flashlight up at the bridge the first night, right thru the fog the eerie finger reaching the pale bottom of that high monstrosity, and even spotted it out over the farmless sea as I sat by caves in the crashing dark in my fisherman’s outfit writing down what the sea was saying — Worst of all spotting it up at those tangled mad cliffsides ‘where owls hooted ooraloo — becoming acquainted and swallowing fears and settling down to life in the little cabin with its warm glow of woodstove and kerosene lamp and let the ghosts fly their asses off… The Bhikku’s home in his woods, he only wants peace, peace he will get — Tho why after three weeks of perfect happy peace and adjustment in these strange woods my soul so went down the drain when I came back with Dave Wain and Romana and my girl Billie and her kid, I’ll never know — Worth the telling only if I dig deep into everything.Because it was so beautiful at first, even the circumstance of my sleeping bag suddenly erupting feathers in the middle of the night as I turned over to sleep on, so I curse and have to get up and sew it by lamplight or in the morning it might be empty of feathers… And as I bend poor mother head over my needle and thread in the cabin, by the fresh fire and in the light of the kerosene lamp, here come those damned silent black wings flapping and throwing shadows all over my little home, the bloody bat’s come in my house — Trying to sew a poor patch on my old crumbly sleepingbag (mostly ruined by my having to sweat out a fever inside of it in a hotel room in Mexico City in 1957 right after the gigantic earthquake there), the nylon all rotten almost from all that old sweat, but still soft, tho so soft I had to cut out a piece of old shirt flap and patch over the rip — I remember looking up from my middle of the night chore and saying bleakly “They, yes, have bats in Mien Mo valley’… But the fire crackles, the patch gets sewn, the creek gurgles and thumps outside — A creek having so many voices it’s amazing, from the kettledrum basin deep bumpbumps to the little gurgly feminine crickles over shallow rocks, sudden choruses of other singers and voices from the log dam, dibble dabble all night long and all day long the voices of the creek amusing me so much at first but in the later horror of that madness night becoming the babble and rave of evil angels in my head — So not minding the bat or the rip finally, ending up cant sleep because too awake now and it’s 3 A."
14885,7,M.
14886,7,"so the fire I stoke and I settle down and read the entire Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde novel in the wonderful little handsized leather book left there by smart Monsanto who also must’ve read it with wide eyes on a night like that — Ending the last elegant sentences at dawn, time to get up and fetch water from gurgly creek and start breakfast of pancakes and syrup And saying to myself “So why fret when something goes wrong like your sleepingbag breaking in the night, use self reliance’… “Screw the bats” I add."
14887,7,"Marvelous opening moment in fact of the first afternoon I’m left alone in the cabin and I make my first meal, wash my first dishes, nap, and wake up to hear the rapturous ring of silence or Heaven even within and throughout the gurgle of the creek — When you say AM ALONE and the cabin is suddenly home only because you made one meal and washed your firstmeal dishes — Then nightfall, the religious vestal lighting of the beautiful kerosene lamp after careful washing of the mantle in the creek and carefuldrying with toilet paper, which spoils it by specking it so you again wash it in the creek this time just let the mantle drip dry in the sun, the late afternoon sun that disappears so quickly behind those giant high steep canyon walls… Nightfall, the kerosene lamp casts a glow in the cabin, I go out and pick some ferns like the ferns of the Lankavatara Scripture, those hairnet ferns, “Look sirs, a beautiful hairnet! “ — Late afternoon fog pours in over the canyon walls, sweep, cover the sun, it gets cold, even the flies on the porch are as so sad as the fog on the peaks — As daylight retreats the flies retreat like polite Emily Dickinson flies and when it’s dark they’re all asleep in trees or someplace — At high noon they’re in the cabin with you but edging further towards the open doorsill as the afternoon lengthens, how."
14888,7,"“strangely gracious — There’s the hum of the bee drone two blocks away the racket of it you’d think it was right over the roof, when the bee drone swirls nearer and nearer (gulp again) you retreat into the cabin and wait, maybe they got a message to come and see you all two thousand of em — But getting used to the bee drone finally which seems to happen like a big party once a week… And so everything eventually marvelous.Even the first frightening night on the beach in the fog with my notebook and pencil, sitting there crosslegged in the sand facing all the Pacific fury flashing on rocks that rise like gloomy sea shroud towers out of the cove, the bingbang cove with its seas booming inside caves and slapping out, the cities of seaweed floating up and down you can even see their dark leer in the phosphorescent seabeach nightlight… That first night I sit there and all I know, as I look up, is the kitchen light is on, on the cliff, to the right, where somebody’s just built a cabin overlooking all the horrible Sur, somebody up there’s having a mild and tender supper that’s all I know… The lights from the cabin kitchen up there go out like a little weak lighthouse beacon and ends suspended a thousand feet over the crashing shore — Who would build a cabin up there but some bored but hoary old adventurous architect maybe got sick of running for congress and one of these days a big Orson Welles tragedy with screaming ghosts a woman in a white nightgown’ll go flying down that sheer cliff — But actually in my mind what I really see is the kitchen lights of that mild and tender maybe even romantic supper up there, in all that howling fog, and here I am way below in the Vulcan’s Forge itself looking up with sad eyes — Blanking my little Camel cigarette on a billion year old rock that rises behind my head to a height unbelievable — The little kitchen light on the cliff is only on the end of it, behind it the shoulders of the great sea hound cliff go rising up and back and seeping inland higher and higher till I gasp to think “Looks like a reclining dog, big friggin shoulders on that sonofabitch” — Riseth and sweepeth and scareth men to death but what is death anyway in all this water and rock."

14891,7,"the fog starts dripping all wet so I have to go indoors with wet sleepingbag and make new arrangements but who cant sleep like a log in a solitary cabin in the woods, you wake up in the late morning so refreshed and realizing the universe namelessly: the universe is an Angel — But easy enough to say when you’ve had your escape from the gooky city turn into a success — And it’s finally only in the woods you get that nostalgia for “cities” at last, you dream of long gray journeys to cities where soft evenings’ll unfold like Paris but never seeing how sickening it will be because of the primordial innocence of health and stillness in the wilds… So I tell myself “Be Wise.”6THOUGH THERE ARE faults to Monsanto’s cabin like no screened windows to keep the flies out in the daytime just big board windows, so that also on foggy days when it’s damp if you leave them open it’s too cold, if you leave them closed you cant see anything and have to light the lamp at noon — And but for that no other faults — It’s all marvelous — And at first it’s so amazing to be able to enjoy dreamy afternoon meadows of heather up the other end of the canyon and just by walking less than a half mile you can suddenly also enjoy wild gloomy sea coast, or if you’re sick of either of these just sit by the creek in a gladey spot and dream over snags — So easy in the woods to daydream and pray to the local spirits and say “Allow me to stay here, I only want peace” and those foggy peaks answer back mutely Yes… And to say to yourself (if you’re like me with theological preoccupations) (at least at that time, before I went mad I still had such preoccupations) “God who is everything possesses the eye of awakening, like dreaming a long dream of an impossible task and you wake up in a flash, oops, No Task, it’s done and gone’… And in the flush of the first few days of joy I confidently tell myself (not expecting what I’ll do in three weeks only) “no more dissipation, it’s time for me to quietly watch the world and even enjoy it, first in woods like these, then just calmly walk and talk among people of the world, no booze, no drugs, no binges, no bouts with beatniks and drunks and junkies and everybody, no more I ask myself the question O why is God torturing me, that’s it, be a loner, travel, talk to waiters only, in fact, in Milan, Paris, just talk to waiters, walk around, no more self-imposed agony… it’s time to think and watch and keep concentrated on the fact that after all this whole surface of the world as we know it now will be covered with the silt of a billion years in time.."

14896,7,"No Trespassing’, or terraces of fern in the dripping redwood shade, and you think “A long way from the beat generation, in this rain forest’… So I angle back down to the home canyon and down the path past the cabin and out to the sea where the mule is on the sea shore, nibbling under that one thousand foot bridge or sometimes just standing staring at me with big brown Garden of Eden eyes — The mule being a pet of one of the families who have a cabin in the canyon and it, as I say Alf by name, just wanders from one end of the canyon where the corral fence stops him, to the wild seashore where the sea stops him but a strange Gauguinesque mule when you first see him, leaving his black dung on the perfect white sand, an immortal and primordial mule owning a whole valley — I even finally later find out where Alf sleeps which is like a sacred grove of trees in that dreaming meadow of heather — So I feed Alf the last of my apples which he receives with big faroff teeth inside his soft hairy muzzle, never biting, just muffing up my apple from my outstretched palm, and chomping away sadly, turning to scratch his behind against a tree with a big erotic motion that gets worse and worse till finally he’s standing there with erectile dong that would scare the Whore of Babylon let alone me.All kinds of strange and marvelous things like the weird Ripley situation of a huge tree that’s fallen across a creek maybe 500 years ago and’s made a bridge thereby, the other end of its trunk is now buried in ten feet of silt and foliage, strange enough but out of the middle trunk over the water rises straight another redwood tree looking like it’s been planted in the treetrunk, or stuck down into it by a God hand, I cant figure it out and stare at this chewing furiously on big choking handfulls of peanuts like a college boy — (and only weeks before falling on my head in the Bowery) — Even when a rancher car goes by I daydream mad ideas like, here comes Farmer Jones and his two daughters and here I am with a 6o-foot redwood tree under my arm walking slowly pulling it along, they are amazed and scared, “Are we dreaming? can anybody be that strong? “ they even ask me and my big Zen answer is “You only think I’m strong” and I go on down the road carrying my tree — This has me laughing in clover fields for hours… I pass a cow which turns to look at me as it takes a big dreamy crap — Back in the cabin I light the fire and sit sighing and there are leaves skittering on the tin roof, it’s August in Big Sur — I fall asleep in the chair and when I wake up I’m facing the thick little tangled woods outside the door and I suddenly remember them from long ago, even to the particular clumpness of the thickets, stem by stem, the twist of them, like an old home place, but just as I’m wondering what all this mess is, bang, the wind closes the cabin door on my sight of it! So I conclude “I see as much as doors’ll allow, open or shut” — Adding, as I get up, in a loud English Lord voice nobody can hear anyway, “An issue broached is an issue smote, Sire, “ pronouncing ‘issue” like “iss-yew” — And this has me laughing all through supper — Which is potatoes wrapped in foil and thrown on the fire, and coffee, and hunks of Spam roasted on a spit, and applesauce and cheese — And when I light the lamp of after-supper reading, here comes the nightly moth to his nightly death at my lamp… After I put out the lamp temporarily, there’s the moth sleeping on the wall not realizing I’ve put it on again."
14897,7,"Meanwhile by the way and however, every day is cold and cloudy, or damp, not cold in the eastern sense, and every night is absolutely fog: no stars whatever to be seen… But this too turns out to be a marvelous circumstance as I find out later, it’s the “damp season” and the other dwellers (weekenders) of the canyon don’t come out on weekends, I’m absolutely alone for weeks on end (because later in August when the sun conquered the fog suddenly I was amazed to hear laughing and scratching all up and down the valley which had been mine only mine, and when I tried to go to the beach to squat and write there were whole families having outings, some of them younger people who’d simply parked their cars up on the high bridge bluff and climbed down) (some of them in fact gangs of yelling hoodlums)… So the rainforest summer fog was grand and besides when the sun prevailed in August a horrible development took place, huge blasts of frightening gale like wind came pouring into the canyon making all the trees roar with a really frightening intensity that sometimes built up to a booming war of trees that shook the cabin and woke you up — And was in fact one of the things that contributed to my mad fit.But the most marvelous day of all when I completely forgot who I was where I was or the time of day just with my pants rolled up above my knees wading in the creek rearranging the rocks and some of the snags so that the water where I stooped (near the sandy shore) to get jugfuls would, instead of just sluggishly passing by shallow over mud, with bugs in it, now come rushing in a pure gurgly clear stream and deep too — I dug into the white sand and arranged underground rocks so now I could stick a jug in there and tilt the opening to the stream and it would fill up instantly with clear rushing unstagnated bugless drinking water — Making a mill race, is what it’s called — And because now the water rushed so fast and deep right by the sandy stooping place I had to build a kind of seawall of rocks against that rush so that the shore would not be silted away by the race — Doing that, fortifying the outside of the seawall with smaller rocks and finally at sundown with bent head over my sniffling endeavors (the way a kid sniffles when he’s been playing all day) I start inserting tiny pebbles in the spaces between the stones so that no water can sneak over to wash away the shore, even down to the tiniest sand, a perfect sea wall, which I top with a wood plank for everybody to kneel on when they come there to fetch their holy water — Looking up from this work of an entire day, from noon till sundown, amazed to see where I was, who I was, what I’d done — The absolute innocence like of Indian fashioning a canoe all alone in the woods — And as I say only weeks earlier I’d fallen flat on my head in the Bowery and everybody thought I’d hurt myself- So I make supper with a happy song and go out in the foggy moonlight (the moon sent its white luminescence through) and marveled to watch the new swift gurgling clear water run with its pretty flashes of light— ‘And when the fog’s over and the stars and the moon come out at night it’ll be a beautiful sight.”And such things — A whole mess of little joys like that amazing me when I came back in the horror of later to see how they’d all changed and become sinister, even my poor little wooden platform and mill race when my eyes and stomach nauseous and my soul screaming a thousand babbling words, oh — It’s hard to explain and best thing to do is not be false.7BECAUSE ON THE fourth day I began to get bored and noted it in my diary with amazement, “Already bored? “ — Even tho the handsome words of Emerson would shake me out of that where he says (in one of those little redleather books, in the essay on “Self Reliance” a man “is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best’) (applicable both to building simple silly little millraces and writing big stupid stories like this) Words from the trumpet of the morning in America, Emerson, he who announced Whitman and also said “Infancy conforms to nobody” — The infancy of the simplicity of just being happy in the woods, conforming to nobody’s idea about what to do, what should be done— “Life is not an apology” — And when a vain and malicious philanthropic abolitionist accused him of being blind to the issues of slavery he said “Thy love afar is spite at home” (maybe the philanthropist had Negro help anyway) — So once again I’m Ti Jean the Child, playing, sewing patches, cooking suppers, washing dishes (always kept the kettle boiling on the fire and anytime dishes needed to be washed I just pour hot hot water into pan with Tide soap and soak them good and then wipe them clean after scouring with little 5-&-10 wire scourer) — Long nights simply thinking about the usefulness of that little wire scourer, those little yellow copper things you buy in supermarkets for 10 cents, all to me infinitely more interesting than the stupid and senseless “Steppenwolf novel in the shack which I read with a shrug, this old fart reflecting the “conformity” of today and all the while he thought he was a big Nietzsche, old imitator of Dostoevsky fifty years too late (he feels tormented in a “personal hell” he calls it because he doesnt like what other people like! )– Better at noon to watch the orange and black Princeton colors on the wings of a butterfly — Best to go hear the sound of the sea at night on the shore.Maybe I shouldna gone out and scared or bored or belabored myself so much, tho, on that beach at night which would scare any ordinary mortal — Every night around eight after supper I’d put on my big fisherman coat and take the notebook, pencil and lamp and start down the trail (sometimes passing ghostly Alf on the way) and go under that frightful high bridge and see through the dark fog ahead the white mouths of ocean coming high at me — But knowing the terrain I’d walk right on, jump the beach creek, and go to my corner by the cliff not far from one of the caves and sit there like an idiot in the dark writing down the sound of the waves in the notebook page (secretarial notebook) which I could see white in the darkness and therefore without benefit of lamp scrawl on — I was afraid to light my lamp for fear I’d scare the people way up there on the cliff eating their nightly tender supper — (later found out there was nobody up there eating tender suppers, they were overtime carpenters finishing the place in bright lights) — And I’d get scared of the rising tide with its 15 foot waves yet sit there hoping in faith that Hawaii warnt sending no tidal wave I might miss seeing in the dark coming from miles away high as Groomus — One night I got scared anyway so sat on top of 10-foot cliff at the foot of the big cliff and the waves are going “Rare, he rammed the gate rare”— “Raw roo roar”— “Crowsh’- the way waves sound especially at night — The sea not speaking in sentences so much as in short lines: “Which one?… the one ploshed?… the same, ah Boom’… Writing down these fantastic inanities actually but yet I felt I had to do it because James Joyce wasn’t about to do it now he was dead (and figuring “Next year I’ll write the different sound of the Atlantic crashing say on the night shores of Cornwall, or the soft sound of the Indian Ocean crashing at the mouth of the Ganges maybe’) — And I just sit there listening to the waves talk all up and down the sand in different tones of voice ‘Ka bloom, kerplosh, ah ropey otter barnacled be crowsh, are rope the angels in all the sea? “ and such — Looking up occasionally to see rare cars crossing the high bridge and wondering what they’d see on this drear foggy night if they knew a madman was down there a thousand feet below in all that windy fury sitting in the dark writing in the dark — Some sort of sea beatnik, tho anybody wants to call me a beatnik for THIS better try it if they dare — The huge black rocks seem to move — The bleak awful roaring isolateness, no ordinary man could do it I’m telling you — / am a Breton! I cry and the blackness speaks back “Les poissons de la mer parlent Breton” (the fishes of the sea speak Breton) — Nevertheless I go there every night even tho I dont feel like it, it’s my duty (and probably drove me mad), and write these sea sounds, and all the whole insane poem “Sea’.Always so wonderful in fact to get away from that and back to the more human woods and come to the cabin where the fire’s still red and you can see the Bodhisattva’s lamp, the glass of ferns on the table, the box of Jasmine tea nearby, all so gentle and human after that rocky deluge out there — So I make an excellent pan of muffins and tell myself ‘Blessed is the man can make his own bread” — Like that, the whole three weeks, happiness — And I’m rolling my own cigarettes, too — And as I say sometimes I meditate how wonderful the fantastic use I’ve gotten out of cheap little articles like the scourer, but in this instance I think of the marvelous belongings in my rucksack like my 25- cent plastic shaker with which I’ve just made the muffin batter but also I’ve used it in the past to drink hot tea, wine, coffee, whiskey and even stored clean handkerchiefs in it when I traveled — The top part of the shaker, my holy cup, and had it for five years now — And other belongings so valuable compared to the worthlessness of expensive things I’d bought and never used — Like my black soft sleeping sweater also five years which I was now wearing in the damp Sur summer night and day, over a flannel shirt in the cold, and just the sweater for the night’s sleep in the bag — Endless use and virtue of it! — And because the expensive things were of ill use, like the fancy pants I’d bought for recent recording dates in New York and other television appearances and never even wore again, useless things like a $40 raincoat I never wore because it didn’t have slits in the side pockets (you pay for the label and the so called “tailoring’) — Also an expensive tweed jacket bought for TV and never worn again — Two silly sports shirts bought for Hollywood never worn again and were 9 bucks each! — And it’s almost tearful to realize and remember the old green T-shirt I’d found, mind you, eight years ago, mind you, on the DUMP in Watsonville California mind you, and got fantastic use and comfort from it — Like working to fix that new stream in the creek to flow through the convenient deep new waterhole near the wood platform on the bank, and losing myself in this like a kid playing, it’s the little things that count (cliches are truisms and all truisms are true) — On my deathbed I could be remembering that creek day and forgetting the day MGM bought my book, I could be remembering the old lost green dump T-shirt and forgetting the sapphired robes — Mebbe the best way to get into Heaven.I go back to the beach in the daytime to write my “Sea’, I stand there barefoot by the sea stopping to scratch one ankle with one toe, I hear the rhythm of those waves, and they’re saying suddenly “Is Virgin you trying to fathom me” — I go back to make a pot of tea.Summer afternoon…Impatiently chewingThe Jasmine leafAt high noon the sun always coming out at last, strong, beating down on my nice high porch where I sit with books and coffee and the noon I thought about the ancient Indians who must have inhabited this canyon for thousands of years, how even as far back as the loth century this valley must have looked the same, just different trees: these ancient Indians simply the ancestors of the Indians of only recently say 1860… How they’ve all died and quietly buried their grievances and excitements How the creek may have been an inch deeper since logging operations of the last sixty years have removed some of the watershed in the hills back there… How the women pounded the local acorns, acorns or shmacorns, I finally found the natural nuts of the valley and they were sweet tasting — And men hunted deer — In fact God knows what they did because I wasn’t here — But the same valley, a thousand years of dust more or less over their footsteps of A."

14899,7,"960 — And as far as I can see the world is too old for us to talk about it with our new words — We will pass just as quietly through life (passing through, passing through) as the 10th century people of this valley only with a little more noise and a few bridges and dams and bombs that wont even last a million years — The world being just what it is, moving and passing through, actually alright in the long view and nothing to complain about — Even the rocksof the valley had earlier rock ancestors, a billion billion years ago, have left no howl of complaint — Neither the bee, or the first sea urchins, or the clam, or the severed paw — All said So-Is sight of the world, right there in front of my nose as I look, — And looking at that valley in fact I also realize I have to make lunch and it wont be any different than the lunch of those olden men and besides it’ll taste good — Everything is the same, the fog says “We are fog and we fly by dissolving like ephemera, “ and the leaves say “We are leaves and we jiggle in the wind, that’s all, we come and go, grow and fall” — Even the paper bags in my garbage pit say “We are man transformed paper bags made out of wood pulp, we are kinda proud of being paper bags as long as that will be possible, but we’ll be mush again with our sisters the leaves come rainy season” — The tree stumps say “We are tree stumps torn out of the ground by men, sometimes by wind, we have big tendrils full of earth that drink out of the earth’… Men say “We are men, we pull out tree stumps, we make paper bags, we think wise thoughts, we make lunch, we look around, we make a great effort to realize everything is the same” — While the sand says “We are sand, we already know, “ and the sea says “We are always come and go, fall and plosh."
14900,7,"“ — The empty blue sky of space says “All this comes back to me, then goes again, and comes back again, then goes again, and I don’t care, it still belongs to me” — The blue sky adds “Dont call me eternity, call me God if you like, all of you talkers are in paradise: the leaf is paradise, the tree stump is paradise, the paper bag is paradise, the man is paradise, the fog is paradise” — Can you imagine a man with mar-velous insights like these can go mad within a month? (because you must admit all those talking paper bags and sands were telling the truth) — But I remember seeing a mess of leaves suddenly go skittering in the wind and into the creek, then floating rapidly down the creek toward the sea, making me feel a nameless horror even then of “Oh my God, we’re all being swept away to sea no matter what we know or say or do” — And a bird who was on a crooked branch is suddenly gone without my even hearing him.8BUT THERE’S MOONLIT fognight, the blossoms of the fire flames in the stove — There’s giving an apple to the mule, the big lips taking hold… There’s the bluejay drinking my canned milk by throwing his head back with a miffle of milk on his beak — There’s the scratching of the raccoon or of the rat out there, at night — There’s the poor little mouse eating her nightly supper in the humble corner where I’ve put out a little delight-plate full of cheese and chocolate candy (for my days of killing mice are over) — There’s the raccoon in his fog, there the man to his fireside, and both are lonesome for God — There’s me coming back from seaside night sittings like a muttering old Bhikku stumbling down the path — There’s me throwing my spotlight on a sudden raccoon who clambers up a tree his little heart beating with fear but I yell in French “Hello there little man” (allo ti bon-homme) — There’s the bottle of olives, 4gc, imported, pimentos, I eat them one by one wondering about the late afternoon hillsides of Greece — And there’s my spaghetti… with tomato sauce and my oil and vinegar salad and my applesauce relishe my dear, and my black coffee and Roquefort cheese and after-dinner nuts, my dear, all in the woods — (Ten delicate olives slowly chewed at midnight is something no one’s ever done in luxurious restaurants) — There’s the present moment fraught with tangled woods — There’s the bird suddenly quiet on his branch while his wife glances at him… There’s the grace of an axe handle as good as an Eglevsky ballet… There’s ‘Mien Mo Mountain” in the fog illumined August moon mist among other heights gorgeous and misty rising in dimmer tiers somehow rosy in the night like the classic silk paintings of China and Japan — There’s a bug, a helpless little wingless crawler, drowning in a water can, I get it out and it wanders and goofs on the porch till I get sick of watching — There’s the spider in the outhouse minding his own business… There’s my side of bacon hanging from a hook on the ceiling of the shack — There’s the laughter of the loon in the shadow of the moon-There’s an owl hooting in weird Bodhidharma trees — There’s flowers and redwood logs — There’s the simple woodfire and the careful yet absent-minded feeding of it which is an activity that like all activities is no-activity (Wu Wei) yet it is a meditation in itself especially because all woodfires, like snowflakes, are different every time… Yes, there’s the resinous purge of a flame- enveloped redwood log — Yes the cross-sawed redwood log turns into a coal and looks like a City of the Gandharvas or like a western butte at sunset — There’s the bhikku’s broom, the kettle — There’s the laced soft fud over the sand, the sea — There’s all these avid preparations for decent sleep like the night I’m looking for my sleeping socks (so’s not to dirty the sleepingbag inside) and find myself singing “A donde es me sockiboos? “ — Yes, and down in the valley there’s my burro, Alf, the only living being in sight — There’s in mid of sleep the moon appearing — There’s universal substance which is divine substance because where else can it be? — There’s the family of deer on the dirt road at dusk… There’s the creek coughing down the glade — There’s the fly on my thumb rubbing its nose then stepping to the page of my book-There’s the hummingbird swinging his head from side to side like a hoodlum — There’s all that, and all my fine thoughts, even unto my ditty written to the sea “I took a pee, into the sea, acid to acid, and me to ye” yet I went crazy inside three weeks.For who could go crazy that could be so relaxed as that: but wait: there are the signposts of something wrong.9THE FIRST SIGNPOST came after that marvelous day I went hiking, up the canyon road again to the highway at the bridge where there was a rancher mailbox where I could dump mail (a letter to my mother and saying in it give a kiss to Tyke, my cat, and a letter to old buddy Julien addressed to Coaly Rustnut from Runty Onenut) and as I walked way up there I could see the peaceful roof of my cabin way below and half mile away in the old trees, could see the porch, the cot where I slept, and my red handkerchief on the bench beside the cot (a simple little sight: of my handkerchief a half mile away making me unaccountably happy) — And on the way back pausing to meditate in the grove of trees where Alf the Sacred Burro slept and seeing the roses of the unborn in my closed eyelids just as clearly as I had seen the red handkerchief and also my own footsteps in the seaside sand from way up on the bridge, saw, or heard, the words “Roses of the Unborn” as I sat crosslegged in soft meadow sand, heard that awful stillness at the heart of life, but felt strangely low, as tho premonition of the next day… When I went to the sea in the afternoon and suddenly took a huge deep Yogic breath to get all that good sea air in me but somehow just got an overdose of iodine, or of evil, maybe the sea caves, maybe the seaweed cities, something, my heart suddenly beating — Thinking I’m gonna get the local vibrations instead here I am almost fainting only it isn’t an ecstatic swoon by St Francis, it comes over me in the form of horror of an eternal condition of sick mortality in me — In me and in everyone… I felt completely nude of all poor protective devices like thoughts about life or meditations under trees and the “ultimate” and all that shit, in fact the other pitiful devices of making supper or saying “What I do now next? chop wood? “ — I see myself as just doomed, pitiful — An awful realization that I have been fooling myself all my life thinking there was a next thing to do to keep the show going and actually I’m just a sick clown and so is everybody else… All all of it, pitiful as it is, not even really any kind of commonsense animate effort to ease the soul in this horrible sinister condition (of mortal hopelessness) so I’m left sitting there in the sand after having almost fainted and stare at the waves which suddenly are not waves at all, with I guess what must have been the goopiest downtrodden expression God if He exists must’ve ever seen in His movie career — Eh vache, I hate to write — All my tricks laid bare, even the realization that they’re laid bare itself laid bare as a lotta bunk — The sea seems to yell to me GO TO YOUR DESIRE DONT HANG AROUND HERE — For after all the sea must be like God, God isn’t asking us to mope and suffer and sit by the sea in the cold at midnight for the sake of writing down useless sounds, he gave us the tools of self reliance after all to make it straight thru bad life mortality towards Paradise maybe I hope… But some miserables like me don’t even know it, when it comes to us we’re amazed — Ah, life is a gate, a way, a path to Paradise anyway, why not live for fun and joy and love or some sort of girl by a fireside, why not go to your desire and LAUGH… but I ran away from the seashore and never came back again without that secret knowledge: that it didnt want me there, that I was a fool to sit there in the first place, the sea has its waves, the man has his fireside, period.That being the first indication of my later flip — But also on the day of leaving the cabin to hitch hike back to Friscoand see everybody and by now I’m tired of my food (forgot to bring jello, you need jello after all that bacon fat and cornmeal in the woods, every woodsman needs jello) (or cokes) (or something) But it’s time to leave, I’m now so scared by that iodine blast by the sea and by the boredom of the cabin I take 20 dollars worth of perishable food left and spread it out on a big board below the cabin porch for the bluejays and the raccoon and the mouse and the whole lot, pack up, and go — But before I go I realize this isn’t my own cabin (here’s the second signpost of my madness), I have no right to hide Monsanto’s rat poison, as I’ve been doing, feeding the mouse instead, as I said — So like a dutiful guest in another man’s cabin I take the cover off the rat poison but compromise by simply leaving the box on the top shelf, so nobody can complain — And go off like that — But during my absence, but — You’ll see.10WITH MY MIND even and upright and abiding nowhere, as Hui Neng would say, I go dancing off like a fool from my sweet retreat, rucksack on back, after only three weeks and really after only three or four days of boredom, and go hankering back for the city— “You go out in joy and in sadness you return, “ says Thomas a Kempis talking about all the fools who go forth for pleasure like high schoolboys on Saturday night hurrying clacking down the sidewalk to the car adjusting their ties and rubbing their hands with anticipatory zeal, only to end up Sunday morning groaning in blearly beds that Mother has to make anyway — It’s a beautiful day as I come out of that ghostly canyon road and step out on the coast highway, just this side of Raton Canyon bridge, and there they are, thousands and thousands of tourists driving by slowly on the high curves all oo ing and aa ing at all that vast blue panorama of sea washing and raiding at the coast of California — I figure I’ll get a ride into Monterey real easy and take the bus there and be in Frisco by nightfall for a big ball of wino yelling with the gang, I feel in fact Dave Wain oughta be back by now, or Cody will be ready for a ball, and there’ll be girls, and such and such, forgetting entirely that only three weeks previous I’d been sent fleeing from that gooky city by the horrors — But hadn’t the sea told me to flee back to my own reality?But it is beautiful especially to see up ahead north a vast expanse of curving seacoast with inland mountains dreaming under slow clouds, like a scene of ancient Spain, or properly really like a scene of the real essentially Spanish California, the old Monterey pirate coast right there, you can see what the Spaniards must’ve thought when they came around the bend in their magnificent sloopies and saw all that dreaming fatland beyond the seashore whitecap doormat — Like the land of gold — The old Monterey and Big Sur and Santa Cruz magic — So I confidently adjust my pack straps and start trudging down the road looking back over my shoulder to thumb.This is the first time I’ve hitch hiked in years and I soon begin to see things have changed in America, you cant get a ride any more (but of course especially on a strictly tourist road like this coast highway with no trucks or business)… Sleek long stationwagon after wagon comes sleering by smoothly, all colors of the rainbow and pastel at that, pink, blue, white, the husband is in the driver’s seat with a long ridiculous vacationist hat with a long baseball visor making him look witless and idiot — Besides him sits wifey, the boss of America, wearing dark glasses and sneering, even if he wanted to pick me up or anybody up she wouldn’t let him — But in the two deep backseats are children, children, millions of children, all ages, they’re fighting and screaming over ice cream, they’re spilling vanilla all over the Tartan seatcovers — There’s no room anymore anyway for a hitch hiker, tho conceivably the poor bastard might be allowed to ride like a meek gunman or silent murderer in the very back platform of the wagon, but here no, alas! here is ten thousand racks of drycleaned and perfectly pressed suits and dresses of all sizes for the family to look like millionaires every time they stop at a roadside dive for bacon and eggs — Every time the old man’s trousers start to get creased a little in the front he’s made to take down a fresh pair of slacks from the back rack and go on, like that, bleakly, tho he might have secretly wished just a good oldtime fishing trip alone or with his buddies for this year’s vacation — But the PTA has prevailed over every one of his desires by now, 1960s, it’s no time for him to yearn for Big Two Hearted River and the old sloppy pants and string of fish in the tent, or the woodfire with Bourbon at night — It’s time for motels, roadside driveins, bringing napkins to the gang in the car, having the car washed before the return trip — And if he thinks he wants to explore any of the silent secret roads of America it’s no go, the lady in the sneering dark glasses has now become the navigator and sits there sneering over her previously printed blue-lined roadmap distributed by happy executives in neckties to the vacationists of America who would also wear neckties (after having come along so far) but the vacation fashion is sports shirts, long visored hats, dark glasses, pressed slacks and baby’s first shoes dipped in gold oil dangling from the dashboard — So here I am standing in that road with that big woeful rucksack but also probably with that expression of horror on my face after all those nights sitting in the seashore under giant black cliffs, they see in me the very apotheosical opposite of their every vacation dream and of course drive on — That afternoon I say about five thousand cars or probably three thousand passed me not one of them ever dreamed of stopping — Which didnt bother me anyway because at first seeing that gorgeous long coast up to Monterey I thought “Well I’ll just hike right in, it’s only fourteen miles, I oughta do that easy” — And on the way there’s all kindsa interesting things to see anyway like the seals barking on rocks below, or quiet old farms made of logs on the hills across the highway, or sudden upstretches that go along dreamy seaside meadows where cows grace and graze in full sight of endless blue Pacific — But because I’m wearing desert boots with their fairly thin soles, and the sun is beating hot on the tar road, the heat finally gets through the soles and I begin to deliver heat blisters inmy sockiboos — I’m limping along wondering what’s the matter with me when I realize I’ve got blisters — I sit by the side of the road and look — I take out my first aid kit from the pack and apply unguents and put on cornpads and carry on — But the combination of the heavy pack and the heat of the road increases the pain of the blisters until finally I realize I’ve got to hitch hike a ride or never make it to Monterey at all."
14901,7,"But the tourists bless their hearts after all, they couldnt know, only think I’m having a big happy hike with my rucksack and they drive on, even tho I stick out my thumb– I’m in despair because I’m really stranded now, and by the time I’ve walked seven miles I still have seven to go but I cant go on another step — I’m also thirsty and there are absolutely no filling stations or anything along the way– My feet are ruined and burned, it develops now into a day of complete torture, from nine o’clock in the morning till four in the afternoon I negotiate those nine or so miles when I finally have to stop and sit down and wipe the blood off my feet — And then when I fix the feet and put the shoes on again, to hike on, I can only do it mincingly with little twinkletoe steps like Babe Ruth, twisting footsteps every way I can think of not to press too hard on any particular blister — So that the tourists (lessening now as the sun starts to go down) can now plainly see that there’s a man on the highway limping under a huge pack and asking for a ride, but still they’re afraid he may be the Hollywood hitch hiker with the hidden gun and besides he’s got a rucksack on his back as tho he’d just escaped from the war in Cuba… Or’s got dismembered bodies in the bag anyway — But as I say I dont blame them.The only car that passes that might have given me a ride is going in the wrong direction, down to Sur, and it’s a rattly old car of some kind with a big bearded “South Coast Is the Lonely Coast” folksinger in it waving at me but finally a little truck pulls up and waits for me 50 yards ahead and I limprun that distance on daggers in my feet — It’s a guy with a dog — He’ll drive me to the next gas station, then he turns off — But when he learns about my feet he takes me clear to the bus station in Monterey — Just as a gesture of kindness — No particular reason, and I’ve made no particular plea about my feet, just mentioned it.I offer to buy him a beer but he’s going on home for supper so I go into the bus station and clean up and change and pack things away, stow the bag in the locker, buy the bus ticket, and go limping quietly in the blue fog streets of Monterey evening feeling lights as feather and happy as a millionaire — The last time I ever hitch hiked — And NO RIDES a sign.11THE NEXT SIGN is in Frisco itself where after a night of perfect sleep in an old skid row hotel room I go to see Monsanto at his City Lights bookstore and he’s smiling and glad to see me, says “We were coming out to see you next weekend you should have waited, “ but there’s something else in his expression — When we’re alone he says “Your mother wrote and said your cat is dead.”Ordinarily the death of a cat means little to most men, a lot to fewer men, but to me, and that cat, it was exactly and no lie and sincerely like the death of my little brother — I loved Tyke with all my heart, he was my baby who as a kitten just slept in the palm of my hand with his little head hanging down, or just purring, for hours, just as long as I held him that way, walking or sitting — He was like a floppy fur wrap around my wrist, I just twist him around my wrist or drape him and he just purred and purred and even when he got big I still held him that way, I could even hold this big cat in both hands with my arms outstretched right over my head and he’d just purr, he had complete confidence in me — And when I’d left New York to come to my retreat in the woods I’d carefully kissed him and instructed him to wait for me, ‘Attends pour mue kitigingoo” — But my mother said in the letter he had died the NIGHT AFTER I LEFT! — But maybe you’ll understand me by seeing for yourself by reading the letter:“Sunday 20 July 1960, Dear Son, I’m afraid you wont like my letter because I only have sad news for you right now."
14902,7,I really dont know how to tell you this but Brace up Honey.
14903,7,I’m going through hell myself.
14904,7,Little Tyke is gone.
14905,7,"Saturday all day he was fine and seemed to pick up strength, but late at night I was watching TV a late movie."
14906,7,Just about 1: 30 A.
14907,7,M.
14908,7,when he started belching and throwing up.
14909,7,I went to him and tried to fix him up but to no availe.
14910,7,He was shivering like he was cold so I rapped him up in a Blanket then he started to throw up all over me.
14911,7,And that was the last of him.
14912,7,Needless to say how I feel and what I went through.
14913,7,I stayed up till “day Break” and did all I could to revive him but it was useless.
14914,7,I realized at 4 A.
14915,7,M.
14916,7,he was gone so at six I wrapped him up good in a clean blanket — and at 7 A.
14917,7,M.
14918,7,went out to dig his grave.
14919,7,I never did anything in my whole life so heart breaking as to bury my beloved little Tyke who was as human as you and I.
14920,7,"I buried him under the Honeysuckle vines, the corner, of the fence."
14921,7,I just cant sleep or eat.
14922,7,I keep looking and hoping to see him come through the cellar door calling Ma Wow.
14923,7,"I’m just plain sick and the weirdest thing happened when I buried Tyke, all the black Birds I fed all Winter seemed to have known what was going on."
14924,7,Honest Son this is no lies.
14925,7,"There was lots and lots of em flying over my head and chirping, and settling on the fence, for a whole hour after Tyke was laid to rest — that’s something I’ll never forget — I wish I had a camera at the time but God and Me knows it and saw it."
14926,7,Now Honey I know this is going to hurt you but I had to tell you somehow… I’m so sick not physically but heart sick… I just cant believe or realize that my Beautiful little Tyke is no more — and that I wont be seeing him come through his little “Shanty” or Walking through the green grass… PS.
14927,7,"I’ve got to dismantle Tyke’s shanty, I just cant go out there and see it empty — as is."
14928,7,"Well Honey, write soon again and be kind to yourself."
14929,7,"Pray the real “God” — Your old Mom XXXXXX.”So when Monsanto told me the news and I was sitting there smiling with happiness the way all people feel when they come out of a long solitude either in the woods or in a hospital bed, bang, my heart sank, it sank in fact with the same strange idiotic helplessness as when I took the unfortunate deep breath on the seashore — All the premonitions tying in together.Monsanto sees that I’m terribly sad, he sees my little smile (the smile that came over me in Monterey just so glad to be back in the world after the solitudes and I’d walked around the streets just bemusedly Mona Lisa’ing at the sight of everything) — He sees now how that smile has slowly melted away into a mawk of chagrin — Of course he cant know since I didn’t tell him and hardly wanta tell it now, that my relationship with my cat and the other previous cats has always been a little dotty: some kind of psychological identification of the cats with my dead brother Gerard who’d taught me to love cats when I was 3 and 4 and we used to lie on the floor on our bellies and watch them lap up milk — The death of “little brother” Tyke indeed — Monsanto seeing me so downcast says “Maybe you oughta go back to the cabin for a few more weeks — or are you just gonna get drunk again”— “I’m gonna get drunk yes” — Because anyway there are so many things brewing, everybody’s waiting, I’ve been daydreaming a thousand wild parties in the woods — In fact it’s fortunate I’ve heard of the death of Tyke in my favorite exciting city of San Francisco, if I had been home when he died I might have gone mad in a different way but tho I now ran out to get drunk with the boys and still once in a while that funny little smile of joy came back as I drank, and melted away again because now the smile itself was a reminder of death, the news made me go mad anyway at the end of the three week binge, creeping up on me finally on that terrible day of St Carolyn By The Sea as I can also call it — All, all confusing till I explain.Meanwhile anyway poor Monsanto a man of letters wants to enjoy big new swappings with me about writing and what everybody’s doing, and then Fagan comes into the store (downstairs to Monsanto’s old rolltop desk making me also feel chagrin because it always was the ambition of my youth to end up a kind of literary businessman with a rolltop desk, combining my father’s image with the image of myself as a writer, which Monsanto without even thinking about it has accomplished at the drop of a hat) — Monsanto with his husky shoulders, big blue eyes, twinkling rosy skin, that perpetual smile of his that earned him the name Smiler in college and a smile you often wondered “Is it real? “ until you realized if Monsanto should ever stop using that smile how could the world go on anyway — It was that kind of smile too inseparable from him to be believably allowed to disappear — Words words words but he is a grand guy as I’ll show and now with real manly sympathy he really felt I should not go on big binges if I felt so bad, “At any rate, “ sez he, “you can go back a little later huh”— “Okay Lorry”— “Did you write anything? “— “I wrote the sounds of the sea, I’ll tell you all about it — It was the most happy three weeks of my life dammit and now this has to happen, poor little Ty."
14930,8,"In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.“Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that."
14931,8,"In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores."
14932,8,"The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret grief’s of wild, unknown men."
14933,8,"Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions."
14934,8,Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope.
14935,8,"I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parceled out unequally at birth.And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit."
14936,8,"Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on."
14937,8,When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart.
14938,8,"Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn."
14939,8,"If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him; some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away."
14940,8,"This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again."
14941,8,"No—Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.My family has been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for three generations."
14942,8,"The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the ’J ’wholesale hardware business that my father carries on to-day.I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—with special reference to the rather hardboiled painting that hangs in father’s office."
14943,8,"I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War."
14944,8,I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless.
14945,8,"Instead of being the warm center of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond business."
14946,8,"Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man."
14947,8,"All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, “Why—ye-es,” with very grave, hesitant faces."
14948,8,"Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea."
14949,8,"He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone."
14950,8,"I had a dog—at least I had him for a few days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.“How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked helplessly.I told him."
14951,8,And as I walked on I was lonely no longer.
14952,8,"I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler."
14953,8,"He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air."
14954,8,"I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew."
14955,8,And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides.
14956,8,"I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News—and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.” This isn’t just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America."
14957,8,"It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land."
14958,8,"Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound."
14959,8,"They are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead."
14960,8,"To the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them."
14961,8,"My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season."
14962,8,"The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual imitation of some Hotel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden."
14963,8,It was Gatsby’s mansion.
14964,8,"Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr."
14965,8,"Gatsby, it was a mansion, inhabited by a gentleman of that name."
14966,8,"My own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a month.Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans."
14967,8,"Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom in college."
14968,8,"And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anticlimax."
14969,8,"His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicago and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away; for instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest."
14970,8,It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.Why they came East I don’t know.
14971,8,"They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together."
14972,8,"This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all."
14973,8,"Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay."
14974,8,"The lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run."
14975,8,"The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.He had changed since his New Haven years."
14976,8,Now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner.
14977,8,Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward.
14978,8,"Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat."
14979,8,"It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed."
14980,8,"There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.“Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to say, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” We were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.“I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore.“It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around again, politely and abruptly."
14981,8,"“We’ll go inside.”We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end."
14982,8,The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house.
14983,8,"A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon."
14984,8,"They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house."
14985,8,I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall.
14986,8,"Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.The younger of the two was a stranger to me."
14987,8,"She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it, which was quite likely to fall."
14988,8,"If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room.“I’m p-paralyzed with happiness.”She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see."
14989,8,That was a way she had.
14990,8,She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker.
14991,8,"(I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)At any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright."
14992,8,Again a sort of apology arose to my lips.
14993,8,"Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice."
14994,8,"It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again."
14995,8,"Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East, and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.“Do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.“The whole town is desolate."
14996,8,"All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all night along the north shore.”“How gorgeous! Let’s go back, Tom."
14997,8,To-morrow!” Then she added irrelevantly: “You ought to see the baby.”“I’d like to.”“She’s asleep.
14998,8,She’s three years old.
14999,8,"Haven’t you ever seen her?”“Never.”“Well, you ought to see her."
15000,8,"She’s—”Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.“What you doing, Nick?”“I’m a bond man.”“Who with?”I told him.“Never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.This annoyed me.“You will,” I answered shortly."
15001,8,"“You will if you stay in the East.”“Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more."
15002,8,“I’d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.”At this point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely!” with such suddenness that I started—it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the room.
15003,8,"Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.“I’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember.”“Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted, “I’ve been trying to get you to New York all afternoon.”“No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry, “I’m absolutely in training.”Her host looked at her incredulously."
15004,8,“You are!” He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass.
15005,8,"“How you ever get anything done is beyond me.”I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” I enjoyed looking at her."
15006,8,"She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet."
15007,8,"Her gray sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face."
15008,8,"It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.“You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously."
15009,8,“I know somebody there.”“I don’t know a single—”“You must know Gatsby.”“Gatsby?” demanded Daisy.
15010,8,"“What Gatsby?”Before I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch, open toward the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.“Why candles?” objected Daisy, frowning."
15011,8,She snapped them out with her fingers.
15012,8,“In two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.” She looked at us all radiantly.
15013,8,"“Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.”“We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed.“All right,” said Daisy."
15014,8,"“What’ll we plan?” She turned to me helplessly: “What do people plan?”Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger.“Look!” she complained; “I hurt it.”We all looked—the knuckle was black and blue.“You did it, Tom,” she said accusingly."
15015,8,"“I know you didn’t mean to, but you did do it."
15016,8,"That’s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen of a—”“I hate that word hulking,” objected Tom crossly, “even in kidding.”“Hulking,” insisted Daisy.Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire."
15017,8,"They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained."
15018,8,"They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening, too, would be over and casually put away."
15019,8,"It was sharply different from the West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.“You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret."
15020,8,"“Can’t you talk about crops or something?”I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way.“Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently."
15021,8,“I’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things.
15022,8,"Have you read ‘The Rise of the Colored Empires’ by this man Goddard?”“Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.“Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it."
15023,8,The idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged.
15024,8,"It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”“Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness."
15025,8,“He reads deep books with long words in them.
15026,8,"What was that word we—”“Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently."
15027,8,“This fellow has worked out the whole thing.
15028,8,"It’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.”“We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.“You ought to live in California—” began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.“This idea is that we’re Nordics."
15029,8,"I am, and you are, and you are, and—” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again."
15030,8,"“—And we’ve produced all the things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all that."
15031,8,"Do you see?”There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more."
15032,8,"When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.“I’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered enthusiastically."
15033,8,“It’s about the butler’s nose.
15034,8,"Do you want to bear about the butler’s nose?”“That’s why I came over to-night.”“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people."
15035,8,"He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose—”“Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss Baker.“Yes."
15036,8,"Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position.”For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear, whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside."
15037,8,"As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing.“I love to see you at my table, Nick."
15038,8,"You remind me of a—of a rose, an absolute rose."
15039,8,Doesn’t he?” She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation: “An absolute rose?”This was untrue.
15040,8,I am not even faintly like a rose.
15041,8,"She was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words."
15042,8,Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house.Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning.
15043,8,I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “Sh!” in a warning voice.
15044,8,"A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to hear."
15045,8,"The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.“This Mr."
15046,8,Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor—” I said.“Don’t talk.
15047,8,"I want to hear what happens.”“Is something happening?” I inquired innocently.“You mean to say you don’t know?” said Miss Baker, honestly surprised."
15048,8,"“I thought everybody knew.”“I don’t.”“Why—” she said hesitantly, “Tom’s got some woman in New York.”“Got some woman?” I repeated blankly.Miss Baker nodded.“She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time."
15049,8,"Don’t you think?”Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at the table.“It couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense gayety.She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and continued: “I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic outdoors."
15050,8,There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line.
15051,8,"He’s singing away—” Her voice sang: “It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?”“Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s light enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.”The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air."
15052,8,"Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every one, and yet to avoid all eyes."
15053,8,"I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy skepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency out of mind."
15054,8,"To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police.The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again."
15055,8,"Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front."
15056,8,"In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk."
15057,8,"I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl.“We don’t know each other very well, Nick,” she said suddenly."
15058,8,“Even if we are cousins.
15059,8,You didn’t come to my wedding.”“I wasn’t back from the war.”“That’s true.” She hesitated.
15060,8,"“Well, I’ve had a very bad time."
15061,8,"Nick, and I’m pretty cynical about everything.”Evidently she had reason to be."
15062,8,"I waited but she didn’t say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter.“I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.”“Oh, yes.” She looked at me absently."
15063,8,"“Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said when she was born."
15064,8,Would you like to hear?”“Very much.”“It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things.
15065,8,"Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where."
15066,8,"I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl."
15067,8,"She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept."
15068,8,"‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a girl."
15069,8,"And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.’ ”“You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a convinced way."
15070,8,“Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people.
15071,8,And I know.
15072,8,"I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.” Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and she laughed with thrilling scorn."
15073,8,"“Sophisticated—God, I’m sophisticated!”The instant her voice broke off ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said."
15074,8,"It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me."
15075,8,"I waited, and sure enough in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light."
15076,8,"Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from The Saturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune."
15077,8,"The lamp-light, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.“To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “in our very next issue.”Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up.“Ten o’clock,” she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling."
15078,8,"“Time for this good girl to go to bed.”“Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,” explained Daisy, “over at Westchester.”“Oh—you’re Jordan Baker.”I knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach."
15079,8,"I had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgotten long ago.“Good night,” she said softly."
15080,8,"“Wake me at eight, won’t you?”“If you’ll get up.”“I will."
15081,8,"Good night, Mr."
15082,8,Carraway.
15083,8,"See you anon.”“Of course you will,” confirmed Daisy."
15084,8,"“In fact, I think I’ll arrange a marriage."
15085,8,"Come over often, Nick, and I’ll sort of—oh—fling you together."
15086,8,"You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing -—”“Good night,” called Miss Baker from the stairs."
15087,8,"“I haven’t heard a word.”“She’s a nice girl,” said Tom after a moment."
15088,8,“They oughtn’t to let her run around the country this way.”“Who oughtn’t to?” inquired Daisy coldly.“Her family.”“Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old.
15089,8,"Besides, Nick’s going to look after her, aren’t you, Nick? She’s going to spend lots of week-ends out here this summer."
15090,8,I think the home influence will be very good for her.”Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.“Is she from New York?” I asked quickly.“From Louisville.
15091,8,Our white girlhood was passed together there.
15092,8,Our beautiful white—”“Did you give Nick a little heart-to-heart talk on the veranda?” demanded Tom suddenly.“Did I?” She looked at me.
15093,8,"“I can’t seem to remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race."
15094,8,"Yes, I’m sure we did."
15095,8,"It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know—”“Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,” he advised me.I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later I got up to go home."
15096,8,They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light.
15097,8,"As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called: “Wait! I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important."
15098,8,"We heard you were engaged to a girl out West.”“That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly."
15099,8,“We heard that you were engaged.”“It’s a libel.
15100,8,"I’m too poor.”“But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again’ in a flower-like way."
15101,8,"“We heard it from three people, so it must be true.”Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even vaguely engaged."
15102,8,The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons I had come East.
15103,8,"You can’t stop going with an old friend on account of rumors, and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumored into marriage.Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away."
15104,8,"It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such intentions in her head."
15105,8,"As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman in New York” was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book."
15106,8,"Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.Already it was deep summer on road-house roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard."
15107,8,"The wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life."
15108,8,"The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight, and turning my head to watch it, I saw that I was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbor’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars."
15109,8,Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr.
15110,8,"Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens.I decided to call to him."
15111,8,"Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction."
15112,8,"But I didn’t call to him, for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling."
15113,8,"Involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far way, that might have been the end of a dock."
15114,8,"When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.CHAPTER IIAbout half way between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land."
15115,8,"This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air."
15116,8,"Occasionally a line of gray cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-gray men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.But above the gray land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T."
15117,8,J.
15118,8,Eckleburg.
15119,8,The eyes of Doctor T.
15120,8,J.
15121,8,Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard high.
15122,8,"They look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a non-existent nose."
15123,8,"Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved away."
15124,8,"But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and, when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour."
15125,8,"There is always a halt there of at least a minute, and it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan’s mistress.The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known."
15126,8,"His acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular restaurants with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever he knew."
15127,8,"Though I was curious to see her, I had no desire to meet her—but I did."
15128,8,"I went up to New York with Tom on the train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped to his feet and, taking hold of my elbow, literally forced me from the car.“We’re getting off,” he insisted."
15129,8,"“I want you to meet my girl.”I think he’d tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and his determination to have my company bordered on violence."
15130,8,"The supercilious assumption was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence, and we walked back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg’s persistent stare."
15131,8,"The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing."
15132,8,"One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night restaurant, approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a garage—Repairs."
15133,8,George B.
15134,8,"Wilson, Cars bought and sold.—and I followed Tom inside.The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner."
15135,8,"It had occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and that sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead, when the proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands on a piece of waste."
15136,8,"He was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, and faintly handsome."
15137,8,"When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue eyes.“Hello, Wilson, old man,” said Tom, slapping him jovially on the shoulder."
15138,8,"“How’s business?”“I can’t complain,” answered Wilson unconvincingly."
15139,8,"“When are you going to sell me that car?”“Next week; I’ve got my man working on it now.”“Works pretty slow, don’t he?”“No, he doesn’t,” said Tom coldly."
15140,8,"“And if you feel that way about it, maybe I’d better sell it somewhere else after all.”“I don’t mean that,” explained Wilson quickly."
15141,8,“I just meant—”His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage.
15142,8,"Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door."
15143,8,"She was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously as some women can."
15144,8,"Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering."
15145,8,"She smiled slowly and, walking through her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in the eye."
15146,8,"Then she wet her lips, and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:“Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit down.”“Oh, sure,” agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little office mingling immediately with the cement color of the walls."
15147,8,"A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom.“I want to see you,” said Tom intently."
15148,8,“Get on the next train.”“All right.”“I’ll meet you by the news-stand on the lower level.”She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door.We waited for her down the road and out of sight.
15149,8,"It was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a gray, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.“Terrible place, isn’t it,” said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor Eckleburg.“Awful.”“It does her good to get away.”“Doesn’t her husband object?”“Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York."
15150,8,"He’s so dumb he doesn’t know he’s alive.”So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not quite together, for Mrs."
15151,8,Wilson sat discreetly in another car.
15152,8,"Tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train.She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York."
15153,8,"At the news-stand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a moving-picture magazine, and in the station drugstore some cold cream and a small flask of perfume."
15154,8,"Up-stairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-colored with gray upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine."
15155,8,"But immediately she turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the front glass.“I want to get one of those dogs,” she said earnestly."
15156,8,“I want to get one for the apartment.
15157,8,They’re nice to have—a dog.”We backed up to a gray old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John D.
15158,8,Rockefeller.
15159,8,In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.“What kind are they?” asked Mrs.
15160,8,"Wilson eagerly, as he came to the taxi-window.“All kinds."
15161,8,"What kind do you want, lady?”“I’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t suppose you got that kind?”The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.“That’s no police dog,” said Tom.“No, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man with disappointment in his voice."
15162,8,“It’s more of an Airedale.” He passed his hand over the brown wash-rag of a back.
15163,8,“Look at that coat.
15164,8,Some coat.
15165,8,"That’s a dog that’ll never bother you with catching cold.”“I think it’s cute,” said Mrs."
15166,8,Wilson enthusiastically.
15167,8,“How much is it?”“That dog?” He looked at it admiringly.
15168,8,"“That dog will cost you ten dollars.”The Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it somewhere, though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and settled down into Mrs."
15169,8,"Wilson’s lap, where she fondled the weatherproof coat with rapture.“Is it a boy or a girl?” she asked delicately.“That dog? That dog’s a boy.”“It’s a bitch,” said Tom decisively."
15170,8,“Here’s your money.
15171,8,"Go and buy ten more dogs with it.”We drove over to Fifth Avenue, so warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon that I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner.“Hold on,” I said, “I have to leave you here.”“No, you don’t,” interposed Tom quickly."
15172,8,“Myrtle’ll be hurt if you don’t come up to the apartment.
15173,8,"Won’t you, Myrtle?”“Come on,” she urged."
15174,8,“I’ll telephone my sister Catherine.
15175,8,"She’s said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know.”“Well, I’d like to, but—”We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds."
15176,8,At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses.
15177,8,"Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighborhood, Mrs."
15178,8,"Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases, and went haughtily in.“I’m going to have the McKees come up,” she announced as we rose in the elevator."
15179,8,"“And, of course, I got to call up my sister, too.”The apartment was on the top floor—a small living-room, a small dining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath."
15180,8,"The living-room was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles."
15181,8,"The only picture was an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock."
15182,8,"Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room."
15183,8,"Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with a copy of Simon Called Peter, and some of the small scandal magazines of Broad-way."
15184,8,Mrs.
15185,8,Wilson was first concerned with the dog.
15186,8,"A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk, to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog-biscuits—one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all afternoon."
15187,8,"Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whiskey from a locked bureau door.I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that afternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it, although until after eight o’clock the apartment was full of cheerful sun."
15188,8,Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs.
15189,8,"Wilson called up several people on the telephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some at the drugstore on the corner."
15190,8,"When I came back they had disappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a chapter of Simon Called Peter—either it was terrible stuff or the whiskey distorted things, because it didn’t make any sense to me.Just as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs."
15191,8,"Wilson and I called each other by our first names) reappeared, company commenced to arrive at the apartment-door.The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty, with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky white."
15192,8,Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face.
15193,8,When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms.
15194,8,"She came in with such a proprietary haste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered if she lived here."
15195,8,"But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.Mr."
15196,8,"McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below."
15197,8,"He had just shaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he was most respectful in his greeting to every one in the room."
15198,8,"He informed me that he was in the “artistic game,” and I gathered later that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs."
15199,8,Wilson’s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall.
15200,8,"His wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible."
15201,8,She told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times since they had been married.Mrs.
15202,8,"Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-colored chiffon, which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room."
15203,8,With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change.
15204,8,The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur.
15205,8,"Her laughter, her gestures, her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.“My dear,” she told her sister in a high, mincing shout, “most of these fellas will cheat you every time."
15206,8,All they think of is money.
15207,8,"I had a woman up here last week to look at my feet, and when she gave me the bill you’d of thought she had my appendicitis out.”“What was the name of the woman?” asked Mrs."
15208,8,McKee.“Mrs.
15209,8,Eberhardt.
15210,8,"She goes around looking at people’s feet in their own homes.”“I like your dress,” remarked Mrs."
15211,8,"McKee, “I think it’s adorable.”Mrs."
15212,8,"Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.“It’s just a crazy old thing,” she said."
15213,8,"“I just slip it on sometimes when I don’t care what I look like.”“But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,” pursued Mrs."
15214,8,McKee.
15215,8,“If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it.”We all looked in silence at Mrs.
15216,8,"Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile."
15217,8,Mr.
15218,8,"McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.“I should change the light,” he said after a moment."
15219,8,“I’d like to bring out the modelling of the features.
15220,8,"And I’d try to get hold of all the back hair.”“I wouldn’t think of changing the light,” cried Mrs."
15221,8,McKee.
15222,8,"“I think it’s—”Her husband said “Sh!” and we all looked at the subject again, whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.“You McKees have something to drink,” he said."
15223,8,"“Get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.”“I told that boy about the ice.” Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders."
15224,8,“These people! You have to keep after them all the time.”She looked at me and laughed pointlessly.
15225,8,"Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.“I’ve done some nice things out on Long Island,” asserted Mr."
15226,8,McKee.Tom looked at him blankly.“Two of them we have framed down-stairs.”“Two what?” demanded Tom.“Two studies.
15227,8,"One of them I call Montauk Point—The Gulls, and the other I call Montauk Point-The Sea.”The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.“Do you live down on Long Island, too?” she inquired.“I live at West Egg.”“Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago."
15228,8,At a man named Gatsby’s.
15229,8,"Do you know him?”“I live next door to him.”“Well, they say he’s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm’s."
15230,8,That’s where all his money comes from.”“Really?”She nodded.“I’m scared of him.
15231,8,I’d hate to have him get anything on me.”This absorbing information about my neighbor was interrupted by Mrs.
15232,8,"McKee’s pointing suddenly at Catherine:“Chester, I think you could do something with her,” she broke out, but Mr."
15233,8,"McKee only nodded in a bored way, and turned his attention to Tom.“I’d like to do more work on Long Island, if I could get the entry."
15234,8,"All I ask is that they should give me a start.”“Ask Myrtle,” said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as Mrs."
15235,8,Wilson entered with a tray.
15236,8,"“She’ll give you a letter of introduction, won’t you, Myrtle?”“Do what?” she asked, startled.“You’ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can do some studies of him.” His lips moved silently for a moment as he invented."
15237,8,“George B.
15238,8,"Wilson at the Gasoline Pump, or something like that.”Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear:“Neither of them can stand the person they’re married to.”“Can’t they?”“Can’t stand them.” She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom."
15239,8,"“What I say is, why go on living with them if they can’t stand them? If I was them I’d get a divorce and get married to each other right away.”“Doesn’t she like Wilson either?”The answer to this was unexpected."
15240,8,"It came from Myrtle, who had overheard the question, and it was violent and obscene.“You see,” cried Catherine triumphantly."
15241,8,She lowered her voice again.
15242,8,“It’s really his wife that’s keeping them apart.
15243,8,"She’s a Catholic, and they don’t believe in divorce.”Daisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie.“When they do get married,” continued Catherine, “they’re going West to live for a while until it blows over.”“It’d be more discreet to go to Europe.”“Oh, do you like Europe?” she exclaimed surprisingly."
15244,8,“I just got back from Monte Carlo.”“Really.”“Just last year.
15245,8,"I went over there with another girl.”“Stay long?”“No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back."
15246,8,We went by way of Marseilles.
15247,8,"We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but we got gypped out of it all in two days in the private rooms."
15248,8,"We had an awful time getting back, I can tell you."
15249,8,"God, how I hated that town!”The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean—then the shrill voice of Mrs."
15250,8,"McKee called me back into the room.“I almost made a mistake, too,” she declared vigorously."
15251,8,“I almost married a little kike who’d been after me for years.
15252,8,I knew he was below me.
15253,8,"Everybody kept saying to me: ‘Lucille, that man’s ’way below you!’ But if I hadn’t met Chester, he’d of got me sure.”“Yes, but listen,” said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down, “at least you didn’t marry him.”“I know I didn’t.”“Well, I married him,” said Myrtle, ambiguously."
15254,8,"“And that’s the difference between your case and mine.”“Why did you, Myrtle?” demanded Catherine."
15255,8,"“Nobody forced you to.”Myrtle considered.“I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,” she said finally."
15256,8,"“I thought he knew something about breeding but he wasn’t fit to lick my shoe.”“You were crazy about him for a while,” said Catherine.“Crazy about him!” cried Myrtle incredulously."
15257,8,"“Who said I was crazy about him? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man there.”She pointed suddenly at me, and every one looked at me accusingly."
15258,8,I tried to show by my expression that I had played no part in her past.“The only crazy I was when I married him.
15259,8,I knew right away I made a mistake.
15260,8,"He borrowed somebody’s best suit to get married in, and never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out.” She looked around to see who was listening."
15261,8,"“ ‘Oh, is that your suit?’ I said."
15262,8,‘This is the first I ever heard about it.
15263,8,"But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon.”“She really ought to get away from him,” resumed Catherine to me."
15264,8,“They’ve been living over that garage for eleven years.
15265,8,"And Tom’s the first sweetie she ever had.”The bottle of whiskey—a second one—was now in constant demand by all present, excepting Catherine, who “felt just as good on nothing at all.” Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves."
15266,8,"I wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the Park through the soft twilight, but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair."
15267,8,"Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and wondering."
15268,8,"I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.“It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train."
15269,8,I was going up to New York to see my sister and spend the night.
15270,8,"He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes, and I couldn’t keep my eyes off him, but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head."
15271,8,"When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white shirt-front pressed against my arm, and so I told him I’d have to call policeman, but he knew I lied."
15272,8,I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I didn’t hardly know I wasn’t getting into a subway train.
15273,8,"All I kept thinking about, over and over, was ‘You can’t live forever; you can’t live forever.’ ”She turned to Mrs."
15274,8,"McKee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter.“My dear,” she cried, “I’m going to give you this dress as soon as I’m through with it."
15275,8,I’ve got to get another one to-morrow.
15276,8,I’m going to make a list of all the things I’ve got to get.
15277,8,"A massage and a wave, and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ash-trays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother’s grave that’ll last all summer."
15278,8,I got to write down a list so I won’t forget all the things I got to do.”It was nine o’clock—almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch and found it was ten.
15279,8,Mr.
15280,8,"McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action."
15281,8,"Taking out my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the remains of the spot of dried lather that had worried me all the afternoon.The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly."
15282,8,"People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet away."
15283,8,Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs.
15284,8,"Wilson stood face to face, discussing in impassioned voices whether Mrs."
15285,8,Wilson had any right to mention Daisy’s name.“Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!” shouted Mrs.
15286,8,Wilson.
15287,8,"“I’ll say it whenever I want to! Daisy! Dai—”Making a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his open hand.Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women’s voices scolding, and high over the confusion along broken wail of pain."
15288,8,Mr.
15289,8,McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door.
15290,8,"When he had gone halfway he turned around and stared at the scene—his wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and the despairing figure on the couch, bleeding fluently, and trying to spread a copy of Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes of Versailles."
15291,8,Then Mr.
15292,8,McKee turned and continued on out the door.
15293,8,"Taking my hat from the chandelier, I followed.“Come to lunch some day,” he suggested, as we groaned down in the elevator.“Where?”“Anywhere.”“Keep your hands off the lever,” snapped the elevator boy.“I beg your pardon,” said Mr."
15294,8,"McKee with dignity, “I didn’t know I was touching it.”“All right,” I agreed, “I’ll be glad to.”… I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.“Beauty and the Beast… Loneliness… Old Grocery Horse… Brook’n Bridge....”Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania Station, staring at the morning Tribune, and waiting for the four o’clock train.CHAPTER IIIThere was music from my neighbor’s house through the summer nights."
15295,8,In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars.
15296,8,"At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam."
15297,8,"On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains."
15298,8,"And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges, and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves."
15299,8,There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler’s thumb.At least once a fortnight a crop of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby’s enormous garden.
15300,8,"On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold."
15301,8,"In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.By seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums."
15302,8,"The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing up-stairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors, and hair shorn in strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile."
15303,8,"The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other’s names.The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher."
15304,8,"Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word."
15305,8,"The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the center of a group, and then, excited with triumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light.Suddenly one of these gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands like Frisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform."
15306,8,"A momentary hush; the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray’s understudy from the Follies."
15307,8,The party has begun.I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby’s house I was one of the few guests who had actually been invited.
15308,8,People were not invited—they went there.
15309,8,"They got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby’s door."
15310,8,"Once there they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with an amusement park."
15311,8,"Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission.I had been actually invited."
15312,8,"A chauffeur in a uniform of robin’s-egg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer: the honor would be entirely Gatsby’s, it said, if I would attend his “little party” that night."
15313,8,"He had seen me several times, and had intended to call on me long before, but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it—signed Jay Gatsby, in a majestic hand.Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after seven, and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people I didn’t know—though here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train."
15314,8,"I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans."
15315,8,I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or insurance or automobiles.
15316,8,"They were at least agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key.As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host, but the two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements, that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table—the only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone.I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden.Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to some one before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passers-by.“Hello!” I roared, advancing toward her."
15317,8,"My voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden.“I thought you might be here,” she responded absently as I came up."
15318,8,"“I remembered you lived next door to—”She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she’d take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses, who stopped at the foot of the steps.“Hello!” they cried together."
15319,8,“Sorry you didn’t win.”That was for the golf tournament.
15320,8,"She had lost in the finals the week before.“You don’t know who we are,” said one of the girls in yellow, “but we met you here about a month ago.”“You’ve dyed your hair since then,” remarked Jordan, and I started, but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer’s basket."
15321,8,"With Jordan’s slender golden arm resting in mine, we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden."
15322,8,"A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr."
15323,8,"Mumble.“Do you come to these parties often?” inquired Jordan of the girl beside her.“The last one was the one I met you at,” answered the girl, in an alert confident voice."
15324,8,"She turned to her companion: “Wasn’t it for you, Lucille?”It was for Lucille, too.“I like to come,” Lucille said."
15325,8,"“I never care what I do, so I always have a good time."
15326,8,"When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package from Croirier’s with a new evening gown in it.”“Did you keep it?” asked Jordan.“Sure I did."
15327,8,"I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered."
15328,8,It was gas blue with lavender beads.
15329,8,"Two hundred and sixty-five dollars.”“There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that,” said the other girl eagerly."
15330,8,“He doesn’t want any trouble with anybody.”“Who doesn’t?” I inquired.
15331,8,“Gatsby.
15332,8,Somebody told me—” The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.
15333,8,“Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.”A thrill passed over all of us.
15334,8,The three Mr.
15335,8,"Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly.“I don’t think it’s so much that,” argued Lucille sceptically; “it’s more that he was a German spy during the war.”One of the men nodded in confirmation.“I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in Germany,” he assured us positively.“Oh, no,” said the first girl."
15336,8,"“it couldn’t be that, because he was in the American army during the war.” As our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm."
15337,8,“You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody’s looking at him.
15338,8,I’ll bet he killed a man.”She narrowed her eyes and shivered.
15339,8,Lucille shivered.
15340,8,We all turned and looked around for Gatsby.
15341,8,"It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world.The first supper—there would be another one after midnight—was now being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party, who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden."
15342,8,"There were three married couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree."
15343,8,"Instead of rambling, this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside—East Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gayety.“Let’s get out,” whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half-hour; “this is much too polite for me.”We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy."
15344,8,"The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not there."
15345,8,"She couldn’t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn’t on the veranda."
15346,8,"On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books."
15347,8,As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.“What do you think?” he demanded impetuously.“About what?”He waved his hand toward the book-shelves.“About that.
15348,8,As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain.
15349,8,I ascertained.
15350,8,They’re real.”“The books?”He nodded.“Absolutely real—have pages and everything.
15351,8,I thought they’d be a nice durable cardboard.
15352,8,"Matter of fact, they’re absolutely real."
15353,8,"Pages and—Here! Lemme show you.”Taking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the “Stoddard Lectures.”“See!” he cried triumphantly."
15354,8,“It’s a bona-fide piece of printed matter.
15355,8,It fooled me.
15356,8,This fella’s a regular Belasco.
15357,8,It’s a triumph.
15358,8,"What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too—didn’t cut the pages."
15359,8,"But what do you want? What do you expect?”He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf, muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse.“Who brought you?” he demanded."
15360,8,“Or did you just come? I was brought.
15361,8,"Most people were brought.”Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering.“I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,” he continued."
15362,8,“Mrs.
15363,8,Claude Roosevelt.
15364,8,Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night.
15365,8,"I’ve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.”“Has it?”“A little bit, I think."
15366,8,I can’t tell yet.
15367,8,I’ve only been here an hour.
15368,8,Did I tell you about the books? They’re real.
15369,8,"They’re—”“You told us.”We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden; old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the corners—and a great number of single girls dancing individualistically or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps."
15370,8,By midnight the hilarity had increased.
15371,8,"A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and between the numbers people were doing “stunts” all over the garden, while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky."
15372,8,"A pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a baby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger-bowls."
15373,8,"The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.I was still with Jordan Baker."
15374,8,"We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter."
15375,8,I was enjoying myself now.
15376,8,"I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and profound.At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.“Your face is familiar,” he said, politely."
15377,8,"“Weren’t you in the Third Division during the war?”“Why, yes."
15378,8,I was in the ninth machine-gun battalion.”“I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen.
15379,8,"I knew I’d seen you somewhere before.”We talked for a moment about some wet, gray little villages in France."
15380,8,"Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.“Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.”“What time?”“Any time that suits you best.”It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled.“Having a gay time now?” she inquired.“Much better.” I turned again to my new acquaintance."
15381,8,“This is an unusual party for me.
15382,8,I haven’t even seen the host.
15383,8,"I live over there—” I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, “and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.”For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.“I’m Gatsby,” he said suddenly.“What!” I exclaimed."
15384,8,"“Oh, I beg your pardon.”“I thought you knew, old sport."
15385,8,I’m afraid I’m not a very good host.”He smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly.
15386,8,"It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life."
15387,8,"It faced—or seemed to face—the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor."
15388,8,"It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey."
15389,8,"Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd."
15390,8,Some time before he introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.Almost at the moment when Mr.
15391,8,"Gatsby identified himself, a butler hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire."
15392,8,"He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn.“If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,” he urged me."
15393,8,“Excuse me.
15394,8,I will rejoin you later.”When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assure her of my surprise.
15395,8,I had expected that Mr.
15396,8,Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years.“Who is he?” I demanded.
15397,8,"“Do you know?”“He’s just a man named Gatsby.”“Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?”“Now you’re started on the subject,” she answered with a wan smile."
15398,8,"“Well, he told me once he was an Oxford man.”A dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next remark it faded away.“However, I don’t believe it.”“Why not?”“I don’t know,” she insisted, “I just don’t think he went there.”Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s “I think he killed a man,” and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity."
15399,8,I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York.
15400,8,That was comprehensible.
15401,8,"But young men didn’t—at least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.“Anyhow, he gives large parties,” said Jordan, changing the subject with an urban distaste for the concrete."
15402,8,“And I like large parties.
15403,8,They’re so intimate.
15404,8,"At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.“Ladies and gentlemen,” he cried."
15405,8,“At the request of Mr.
15406,8,Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr.
15407,8,"Vladimir Tostoff’s latest work, which attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May."
15408,8,"If you read the papers, you know there was a big sensation.” He smiled with jovial condescension, and added:“Some sensation!” Whereupon everybody laughed.“The piece is known,” he concluded lustily, “as Vladimir Tostoff’s Jazz History of the World.”The nature of Mr."
15409,8,"Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes."
15410,8,His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day.
15411,8,I could see nothing sinister about him.
15412,8,"I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased."
15413,8,"When the Jazz History of the World was over, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men’s arms, even into groups, knowing that some one would arrest their falls—but no one swooned backw."
15414,8,Though i haven’t ever been on the screen I was brought up inpictures.Rudolph Valentino came to my fifth birthday party — or so I was told.
15415,8,"I put this down only to indicate that even before the age of reason I was in a position to watch the wheels go round.I was going to write my memoirs once, The Producer's Daughter, but at eighteen you never quite get around to anything like that.It’s just as well—it would have been as flat as an old column ofLolly Parsons’.My father was in the picture business as another man might be in cotton or steel, and I took it tranquilly."
15416,8,At the worst I accepted Hollywood with the resignation of a ghost assigned to a haunted house.
15417,8,"I knew what you were supposed to think about it but I was obstinately unhorrified.This is easy to say, but harder to make people understand."
15418,8,"When I was at Bennington some of the English teachers who pretended an indifference to Hollywood or its products, really hated it."
15419,8,Hated it way down deep as a threat to their existence.
15420,8,"Even before that, when I was in a convent, a sweet little nun asked me to get her a script of a screen play so she could “teach her class about movie writing” as she had taught them about the essay and the short story.I got the script for her, and I suppose she puzzled over it and puzzled over it, but it was never mentioned in class, and she gave it back to me with an air of offended surprise and not a single comment."
15421,8,"That’s what I half expect to happen to this story.You can take Hollywood for granted like I did, or you can dismissit with the contempt we reserve for what we don’t understand."
15422,8,"Itcan be understood too, but only dimly and in flashes."
15423,8,Not half adozen men have ever been able to keep the whole equation ofpictures in their heads.
15424,8,And perhaps the closest a woman can cometo the set-up is to try and understand one of those men.THE LAST TYCOON4The world from an airplane I knew.
15425,8,Father always had us travelback and forth that way from school and college.
15426,8,"After my sisterdiedwhen I was a junior, I travelled to and fro alone, and thejourney always made me think of her, made me somewhat solemnand subdued."
15427,8,"Sometimes there were picture people I knew on board the plane, and occasionally there was an attractive college boy — but not often during the depression."
15428,8,"I seldom really fell asleep during the trip, what with thoughts of Eleanor and the sense of that sharp rip between coast and coast at least not till we had left those lonely little airports in Tennessee.This trip was so rough that the passengers divided early intothose who turned in right away and those who didn’t want to turnin at all."
15429,8,"There were two of these latter right across from me, and Iwas pretty sure from their fragmentary conversation that they were from Hollywood one of them because he looked like it: a middle-aged Jew, who alternately talked with nervous excitement or else crouched as if ready to spring, in a harrowing silence; the other a man of thirty, whom I was sure I had seen before.He had been to the house or something."
15430,8,"But it might have been pale, plain, stocky when I was a little girl, and so I wasn’t offended that he didn’t recognize me.The proposition pleased me."
15431,8,"It conjured up a pretty picture ofthe actress and her mother being fed by kind Tory bears whobrought them honey, and by gentle fawns who fetched extra milkfrom the does and then lingered near to make pillows for theirheads at night."
15432,8,In turn I told the stewardess about the lawyer andthe director who told their plans to Father one night in those bravedays.
15433,8,"If the bonus army conquered Washington, the lawyer had a boat hidden in the Sacramento River, and he was going to row up stream for a few months and then come back ""because they always needed lawyers after a revolution to straighten out the legal side.”The director had tended more toward defeatism."
15434,8,"He had an old suit, shirt and shoes in waitinghe never did say whether they were his own or whether he got them from the prop department - and he was going to Disappear into the Crowd."
15435,8,"I remember Father saying: ""But they’ll look at your hands! They’ll know you haven’t done manual work for years."
15436,8,"And they’ll ask for your union card.”And I remember how the director’s face fell, and how gloomy he was while he ate his dessert, and how funny and puny they sounded to me.""Is your father an actor, Miss Brady?” asked the stewardess.""I’ve certainly heard the name.”At the name Brady, both the men across the aisle looked up.Sidewise—that Hollywood look, that always seems thrown over oneshoulder."
15437,8,"Then the young, pale, stocky man unbuttoned his safetystrap and stood in the aisle beside us.""Are you Cecilia Brady?"" he demanded accusingly, as if I’d beenWylie White started, and a little too late called after him defiantly:“I only take orders from the pilot.”I recognized the kind of pleasantry that goes on between thepowers in Hollywood and their satellites.The stewardess reproved him:“Not so loud, please some of the passengers are asleep.”I saw now that the other man across the aisle, the middle-agedJew, was on his feet also, staring, with shameless economic lechery,after the man who had just gone by."
15438,8,"Or rather at the back of theman, who gestured sideways with his hand in a sort of farewell, ashe went out of my sight.“I asked the stewardess: “Is he the asitant pilot?”She was unbuckling our belt, about to abandon me to Wylie—White.“No."
15439,8,That’s Mr.
15440,8,Smith.
15441,8,"He has the private compartment, theonly he has it alone."
15442,8,The assistant pilot is always inuniform.” She stood up: “I want to find out if we’re going to begrounded in Nashville.”Wylie White was aghast.—‘bridal suite’“Why?”storm coming up the Mississippi Valley.”“Does that mean well have to stay here all nightV“It’s a9“If this keeps up!”A sudden dip indicated thatitwould.
15443,8,"It tipped Wylie Whiteinto the seat opposite me, shunted the stewardess precipitately downin the direction of the cockpit, and plunked the Jewish man into asitting position."
15444,8,"After the studied, unruffled exclamations of distastethat befitted the air-minded, we setled down."
15445,8,There was an introduction.“Miss Brady—Mr.
15446,8,"Schwartz,” said Wylie White."
15447,8,"“He’s a great friend of your father’s, too.”Mr."
15448,8,Schwartz nodded so vehemently that I could almost hear him saying: “It’s true.
15449,8,"As God is my judge, it’s true!”——THE LAST TYCOONHe might have said this right out loud at one time in his lifewhom something had happened.but he was obviously a man toMeeting him was like encountering a friend who has been in aand got flattened."
15450,8,You stare at your friend andsay: “What happened to you?” And he answers something unintelligible through broken teeth and swollen lips.
15451,8,He can’t even tellyou about it.Mr.
15452,8,Schwartz was physically unmarked; the exaggerated Persiannose and oblique eye-shadow were as congenital as the tip-tilted Irishredness around my father’s nostrils.“Nashville!” cried Wylie White.
15453,8,“That means we go to a hotel.We don’t get to the coast till tomorrow night if then.
15454,8,"My God!I was born in Nashville.”But he would—for the plane was unmistakably going down,down, down, like Alice in the rabbit hole."
15455,8,Cupping my hand againstthe window I saw the blur of the city far away on the left.
15456,8,"Thegreen sign “Fasten your belts No smoking” had been on since we first rode into the storm.“Did you hear what he said?” said Schwartz from one of his fiery silences across the aisle.“Hear what?” asked Wylie.“Hear what he’s calling himself,” said Schwartz."
15457,8,“Mr.
15458,8,"Smith !”“Why not?” asked Wylie.“Oh nothing,” said Schwartz quickly."
15459,8,"“I just thought it wasfunny, Smith.” I never heard a laugh with less mirth in it: “Smith!”But airports lead you way back in history like oases, like the stopson the great trade routes."
15460,8,The sight of air travellers strolling in onesand twos into midnight airports will draw a small crowd any nightup to two.
15461,8,"The young people look at the planes, the older ones lookat the passengerswith a watchful incredulity."
15462,8,"In the big trans-continental planes we were the coastal rich, who casually alighted—THE LAST TYCOON8from our cloud in mid-America."
15463,8,"High adventure might be amongus, disguised as a movie star."
15464,8,But mostly it wasn’t.
15465,8,"And I alwayswished fervently that we looked more interesting than we didjust as I often have at premieres, when the fans look at you withscornful reproach because you’re not a star.On the ground Wylie and I were suddenly friends, because heheld out his arm to steady me when I got out of the plane."
15466,8,"From then on, he made a dead set for me and I didn’t mind."
15467,8,From themoment we walked into the airport it had become plain that if wewere stranded here we were stranded here together.
15468,8,"(It wasn’t likethe time I lost my boy — the time my boy played the piano withlittle New England farmhouse near Bennington, and I realized at last I wasn’t wanted."
15469,8,"Guy Lombardo was on the air playing Top Hat and Chee\ to Chee\, and she taughthim the melodies."
15470,8,The keys falling like leaves and her hands splayedover his as she showed him a black chord.
15471,8,I was a freshman then.)When we went into the airport Mr.
15472,8,"Schwartz was along with us,too, but he seemed in a sort of dream."
15473,8,"All the time we were tryingto get accurate information at the desk, he kept staring at the door that led out to the landing field, as if he were afraid the plane would leave without him."
15474,8,"Then I excused myself for a few minutes and something happened that I didn’t see, but when I came back he and White were standing close together, White talking and Schwartz looking twice as much as if a great truck had just backed up over him."
15475,8,He didn’t stare at the door to the landing field any more.
15476,8,I heard the end of Wylie White’s remark.He broke off as I came up and asked if there was any news.
15477,8,"Itwas then half-past two in the morning.“A little,” said Wylie White."
15478,8,"“They don’t think we’ll be able tostart for three hours anyhow, so some of the softies are going to ahotel."
15479,8,"But I’d like to take you out to the Hermitage, Home ofAndrew Jackson.”“How could we see it in the dark?” demanded Schwartz.“Hell, it’ll be sunrise in two hours.”“You two go,” said Schwartz.“All right—you take the bus to the hotel."
15480,8,It’s still waiting—he’sTHE LAST TYCOON9in there.” Wylie’s voice had a taunt in it.
15481,8,"“Maybe it’d be a goodthing.”“No, I’ll go along with you,” said Schwartz hastily.We took a taxi in the sudden country dark outside, and he seemedto cheer up."
15482,8,"He patted my knee-cap encouragingly.“I should go along,” he said, “I should be chaperone."
15483,8,"Once upona time when I was in the big money, I had a daughter—a beautifuldaughter.”He spoke as if she had been sold to creditors as a tangible asset.“You’ll have another,” Wylie assured him."
15484,8,"“You’ll get it all back.Another turn of the wheel and you’ll be where Cecilia’s papa is,won’t he, Cecilia?”“Where is this Hermitage?” asked Schwartz presently."
15485,8,"“Far awayat the end of nowhere? Will we miss the plane?”“Skip it,” said Wylie."
15486,8,“We ought to’ve brought the stewardessalong for you.
15487,8,"Didn’t you admire the stewardess? I thought she waspretty cute.”We drove for a long time over a bright level countryside, just aroad and a tree and a shack and a tree, and then suddenly along awinding twist of woodland."
15488,8,I could feel even in the darkness thatthe trees of the woodland were green-— that it was all different fromthe dusty olive-tint of California.
15489,8,"Somewhere we passed a negrodriving three cows ahead of him, and they mooed as he scatted themto the side of the road."
15490,8,"They were real cows, with warm, fresh, silkyflanks, and the negro grew gradually real out of the darkness withhis big brown eyes staring at us close to the car, as Wylie gave him“said Thank you thank you,” and .stood there, and a quarter.I thought of the first sheep I ever remember seeing—hundreds of them, and how our car drove suddenly into them on the back lot of the old Laemmle studio."
15491,8,"They were unhappy about being inpictures, but the men in the car with us kept saying:“Swell?”“Is that what you wanted, Dick?”“Isn’t that swell?”And the man named Dick kept standing upin the car as if he were Cortez or Balboa, looking over that grayfleecy undulation."
15492,8,"If I ever knew what picture they were in, I havelong forgotten.THE LAST TYCOON10We had driven an hour."
15493,8,"We crossed a brook over an old rattlyiron bridge laid with planks.Now there were roosters crowing andblue-green shadows stirring every time we passed a farmhouse.“I told you it’d be morning soon,” said Wylie."
15494,8,“I was born near—the son of impoverished southern paupers.
15495,8,"The family manWe had four servants—my father,heresion is now used as an outhouse.my mother and my two sisters."
15496,8,"I refused to join the guild, and so Iwent to Memphis to start my career, which has now reached adead end.” He put his arm around me: “Cecilia, will you marryme, so I can share the Brady fortune?”He was disarming enough, so I let my head lie on his shoulder.“What do you do, Celia."
15497,8,Go to school?”“I go to Bennington.
15498,8,"I’m a junior.”“Oh, I beg your pardon."
15499,8,"I should have known, but I never hadthe advantage of college training."
15500,8,"But a jtmiox why I read in—Esquire that juniors have nothing to learn, Cecilia.”“Why do people think that college girls”—“Don’t apologize knowledge is power.”“You’d know from the way you talk that we were on our way toHollywood,” I said."
15501,8,“It’s always years and years behind the times.”He pretended to be shocked.“You mean girls in the East have no private lives?”“That’s the point.
15502,8,They have got private lives.
15503,8,"You’re botheringme, let go.”“I can’t."
15504,8,"It might wake Schwartz,and I think this is the firstsleep he’s had for weeks."
15505,8,"Listen, Cecilia: I once had an affair withA very short affair."
15506,8,"When it was over sheme in no uncertain terms, she said: ‘Don’t you ever tellthe wife of a producer.said toabout this or I’ll have you thrown out of Hollywood."
15507,8,"My husband’s”a much more important man than you!*I liked him again now, and presendy the taxi turned down a longlane fragrant with honeysuckle and narcissus, and stopped besidethe great grey hulk of the Andrew Jackson house."
15508,8,"The driver turnedaround to tell us something about it, but Wylie shushed him, pointing at Schwartz, and we tiptoed out of the car.“You can’t get into the Mansion now,” the taxi man told uspolitely.THE LAST TYCOONIIWylie and I went and sat against the wide pillars of the steps.“What about Mr."
15509,8,"Schwartz,” I asked."
15510,8,“Who is he?”“To hell with Schwartz.
15511,8,He was the head of some combine onceFirst National? Paramount? United Artists? Now he’s down andout.
15512,8,But he’ll be back.
15513,8,"You can’t flunk out of pictures unless you’re—a dope or a drunk.”“You don’t like Hollywood,” I suggested.“Yes I do."
15514,8,Sure I do.
15515,8,"Say! This isn’t anything to talk about onthe steps of Andrew Jackson’s house—at dawn.”“I li\e Hollywood,” I persisted.“It’s all right."
15516,8,It’sa mining town in lotus land.Who said that?I did.
15517,8,"It’s a good place for toughies, but I went there from Savannah,Georgia."
15518,8,I went to a garden party the first day.
15519,8,My host shook hands—and left me.
15520,8,"It was all there that swimming pool, green moss attwo dollars an inch, beautiful felines having drinks and fun“ And nobody spoke to me."
15521,8,Nota soul.
15522,8,I spoke to half a dozenpeople but they didn’t answer.
15523,8,"That continued for an hour, twohours then I got up from where I was sitting and ran out at adog trot like a crazy man."
15524,8,"I didn’t feel I had any rightful identityuntil I got back to the hotel and the clerk handed me a letter——addressed to me in my name.”Naturally I hadn’t ever had such an experience, but looking backon parties I’d been to, I realized that such things could happen."
15525,8,"Wedon’t go for strangers in Hollywood unless they wear a sign sayingthat their axe has been thoroughly ground elsewhere, and that in anycaseit’snot going tofallon our necks—in other words, unlessthey’re a celebrity."
15526,8,"And they’d better look out even then.“You should have risen above it,” I said smugly."
15527,8,"“It’s not a slamat you when people are rude—it’s a slam at the people they’ve metbefore.”—“Such a pretty girl to say such wise things.”There was an eager to-do in the eastern sky, and Wylie could seeme plain thin with good features and lots of style, and the kickingfetus of a mind."
15528,8,"I wonder what I looked like in that dawn, fiveyears ago."
15529,8,"A litde rumpled and pale, I suppose, but at that age, whenone has the young illusion that most adventures are good, I neededonly a bath and a change to go on for hours.—THE LAST TYCOON12—Wylie stared at me with really flattering appreciation and thensuddenly we were not alone."
15530,8,Mr.
15531,8,"Schwartz wandered apologeticallyinto the pretty scene.“I fell upon a large metal handle,” he said, touching the corner ofhis eye.Wylie jumped up.“Just in time, Mr."
15532,8,"Schwartz,” he said."
15533,8,“The tour is just starting.Home of Old Hickory—America's tenth president.
15534,8,"The victor ofNew Orleans, opponent of the National Bank, and inventor of theSpoils System.”Schwartz looked toward me as toward a jury.“There’s a writer for you,” he said."
15535,8,"“Knows everything and atthe same time he knows nothing.”“What’s that?” said Wylie, indignant.It was my first inkling that he was a writer."
15536,8,"And while I likewriters because if you ask a writer anything, you usually get an—answer—still it belittled him in my eyes."
15537,8,"Writers aren’t people exactly.Or, if they’re any good, they’re a whole lot of people trying so hardto be one person."
15538,8,"It’s like actors, who try so pathetically not to lookin mirrors.Who lean bac\ward trying—only to see their faces in thereflecting chandeliers.“Ain’t writers like that, Celia?” demanded Schwartz."
15539,8,“I haveno words for them.
15540,8,I only know it’s true.”Wylie looked at him with slowly gathering indignation.
15541,8,"“I’veheard that before,” he said."
15542,8,"“Look, Manny, I’m a more practical manthan you any day! I’ve sat in an office and listened to some mysticstalk up and down for hours spouting tripe that’d land him on anut-farm anywhere outside of California—and then at the end tellme how practical he was, and I was a dreamer—and would I kindlygo away and make sense out of what he’d said.”Mr."
15543,8,Schwartz’s face fell into its more disintegrated alignments.One eye looked upward through the tall elms.
15544,8,He raised his handand bit without interest at the cuticle on his second finger.
15545,8,"There wasa bird flying about the chimney of the house, and his glance followedit."
15546,8,"It perched on the chimney pot like a raven, and Mr."
15547,8,"Schwartz’seyes remained fixed upon it as he said “We can’t get in, and it’s timefor you two to go back to the plane.”It was still not quite dawn."
15548,8,"The Hermitage looked like a nice big:THE LAST TYCOON13white box, but a little lonely and vacated still after a hundred years.We walked back to the car."
15549,8,"Only after we had gotten in, and Mr.Schwartz had surprisingly shut the taxi door on us, did we realizehe didn’t intend to come along.“I’m not going to the Coast I decided that when I woke up."
15550,8,"So—I’llstay here,and afterwards the driver could come back forme.”“Going back East?” said Wylie with surprise."
15551,8,"“Just because“I have decided,” said Schwartz, faintly smiling."
15552,8,"“Once I used tobe a regular man of decision—you’d be surprised.” Hefeltin hispocket, as the taxi driver warmed up the engine."
15553,8,“Will you give thisnote to Mr.
15554,8,Smith?”“Shall I come in two hours?” the driver asked Schwartz.“Yes .
15555,8,.
15556,8,.
15557,8,sure.
15558,8,I shall be glad to entertain myself looking around.”I kept thinking of him all the way back to the airport-trying tofit him into that early hour and into that landscape.
15559,8,He had comea long way from some Ghetto to present himself at that raw shrine.Manny Schwartz and Andrew Jackson—it was hard to say them inthe same sentence.
15560,8,"It was doubtful if he knew who Andrew Jacksonwas as he wandered around, but perhaps he figured that if people hadpreserved his house Andrew Jackson must have been someone whowas large and merciful, able to understand."
15561,8,At both ends of life manneeded nourishment: a breast a shrine.
15562,8,"Something to lay himselfbeside when no one wanted him further, and shoot a bullet into his—head.Of course we did not know this for twenty hours."
15563,8,"When we gotto the airport we told the purser that Mr.Schwartz was not con-tinuing, and then forgot about him."
15564,8,"The storm had wandered awayinto Eastern Tennessee and broken against the mountains, and wewere taking off in less than an hour."
15565,8,"Sleepy-eyed travellers appearedfrom the hotel, and I dozed a few minutes on one of those IronMaidens they use for couches."
15566,8,"Slowly the idea of a perilous journeywas recreated out of the debris of our failure: a new stewardess, tall,handsome, flashing dark, exaedy like the other except she wore seersucker instead of French red-and-blue, went briskly past us with asuitcase."
15567,8,Wylie sat beside me as we waited.“Did you give the note to Mr.
15568,8,"Smith?” I asked, half asleep.“Yeah.”THE LAST TYCOON14“Who is Mr."
15569,8,Smith? I suspect he spoiled Mr.
15570,8,"Schwartz’s trip.”“Itwas Schwartz’s fault.”“I’m prejudiced against steam-rollers,” I said."
15571,8,"“My father tries tobe a steam-roller around the house, and I tell him to save it for thestudio.”I wondered if I was being fair;words are the palest counters atthat time in the morning."
15572,8,"“Still, he steam-rollered me into Benning-ton and I’ve always been grateful for that.”“There would be quite a crash,” Wylie said, “if steam-rollerBrady met steam-roller Smith.”“Is Mr."
15573,8,Smith a competitor of Father’s?”“Not exactly.
15574,8,I should say no.
15575,8,"But if he was a competitor, I knowwhere my money would be.”“On Father?”“I’m afraid not.”It was too early in the morning for family patriotism."
15576,8,The pilotwas at the desk with the purser and he shook his head as theyregarded a prospective passenger who had put two nickels in theelectric phonograph and lay alcoholically on a bench fighting offsleep.
15577,8,"The first song he had chosen, Lost, thundered through theroom, followed, after a slight interval, by his other choice, Gone,which was equally dogmatic and final."
15578,8,"The pilot shook his heademphatically and walked over to the passenger.“Afraid we’re not going to be able to carry you this time, oldman.”“Wha?”The drunk sat up, awful-looking, yet discernibly attractive, andI was sorry for him in spite of his passionately ill-chosen music.“Go back to the hotel and get some sleep."
15579,8,"There’ll be anotherplane tonight”“Only going up in ee air.”“Not this time, old man.”In his disappointment the drunk fell off the bench—and abovethe phonograph, a loudspeakersummoned us respectable peopleoutside."
15580,8,"In the corridor of the plane I ran into Monroe Stahr and fellall over him, or wanted to."

15586,8,"From where he stood (and though he was not a tallman, it always seemed high up) he watched the multitudinous practicalities of his world like a proud young shepherd to whom nightand day had never mattered."
15587,8,"He was born sleepless, without a talentso much.for rest or the desire for it.We sat in unembarrassed silence—I had known him since hebecame Father’s partner a dozen years ago, when I was seven andStahr was twenty-two."
15588,8,"Wylie was across the aisle and I didn’t knowwhether or not to introduce them, but Stahr kept turning his ringso abstractedly that he made me feel young and invisible, and Ididn’t dare."
15589,8,"I never dared look quite away from him or quite at him,unless I had something important to say—and I knew he affectedmany other people in the same manner.“I’ll give you this ring, Cecilia.””“I beg your pardon."
15590,8,"I didn’t realize that I was“I’ve got half a dozen like it.”He handed it to me, a gold nugget with the letter S in bold relief.I had been thinking how oddly its bulk contrasted with his fingers,which were delicate and slender like the rest of his body, and likehis slender face with the arched eyebrows and the dark curly hair."
15591,8,"Helooked spiritual at times, but he was a fighter—somebody out of hispast knew him when he was one of a gang of kids in the Bronx, andgave me a description of how he walked always at the head of hisgang, this rather frail boy, occasionally throwing a command back-ward out of the corner of his mouth.Stahr folded my hand over the ring, stood up and addressedWylie.“Come up to the bridal suite,” he said."
15592,8,"“See you later, Cecilia.”Before they went out of hearing, I heard Wylie’s question: “Didyou open Schwartz’s note?” And Stahr:“Not yet.”—6THE LAST TYCOON1Imust be slow, for only then did I realize that Stahr was Mr,Smith.Afterwards Wylie told me what was in the note."
15593,8,"Written by theheadlights of the taxi, it was almost illegible.“Dear Monroe, You are the best of them all I have alwaysadmired your mentality so when you turn against me Iknow it’s no use! I must be no good and am not going tocontinue the journey let me warn you once again look out!I know.“Your friendManny.”Stahr read it twice, and raised his hand to the morning stubbleon his chin.“He’s a nervous wreck,” he said."
15594,8,“There’s nothing to be done—but don’t likeabsolutely nothing.

15596,8,“I’m vain as a woman.
15597,8,"If anybodypretends to be interested in me, I’ll ask for more."
15598,8,I like advice.”Stahr shook his head distastefully.

15600,8,"“This ‘little Napo-leon stuff.’”“It makesme sick,” said Stahr, “but it’s not as bad as some mantrying to help you.”“If you don’t like advice, why do you pay meV'“That’s a question of merchandise,” said Stahr."
15601,8,"“I’m a merchant.I want to buy what’s in your mind.”“You’re no merchant,” said Wylie."
15602,8,"“I knew a lot of them whenI was a publicity man,and I agree with Charles Francis Adams.”“What did he say?”“He knew them all—Gould, Vanderbilt, Carnegie, Astor—and hesaid there wasn’t one he’d care to meet again in the hereafter."
15603,8,"Well—they haven’t improved since then, and that’s why I say you’re nomerchant”THE LAST TYCOON*7“Adams was probably a sourbelly ” said Stahr."
15604,8,"“He wanted tobe head man himself, but he didn’t have the judgment or else thecharacter.”“He had brains,” said Wylie rather tartly.“It takes more than brains."
15605,8,"You writers and artists poop out andget all mixed up, and somebody has to come in and straighten youout.”He shrugged his shoulders."
15606,8,"“You seem to take things so per-sonally,hating people and worshippingthem—-alwaysthinking—especially yourselves."

15608,8,"I like people and I like them to like me, but I wearmy heart where God put it—on the inside.”He broke off.“What did I say to Schwartz in the airport? Do you remember—exacdy?”“You said, ‘Whatever you’re after, the answer is No!’ ”Stahr was silent.“He was sunk,” said Wylie, “but I laughed him out of it."
15609,8,"Wetook Billy Brady’s daughter for a ride.”Stahr rang for the stewardess.“That pilot,” he said, “would he mind if I sat up in front withhim awhile?”“That’s against the rules, Mr."
15610,8,Smith.”“Ask him to step in here a minute when he’s free.”Stahr sat up front all afternoon.
15611,8,"While we slid off the endlessdesert and over the table-lands, dyed with many colors like the whitesands we dyed with colors when I was a child."
15612,8,"Then in the lateafternoon, the peaks themselves—slid under our propellers and—the Mountains of the Frozen Sawwe were close to home.When I wasn’t dozing I was thinking that I wanted to marryStahr, that I wanted to make him love me."
15613,8,"Oh, the conceit!Whaton earth did I have to offer ? But I didn’t think like that then."
15614,8,"I hadthe pride of young women, which draws its strength from suchsublime thoughts as “I’m as good as she is.” For my purposes I wasjust as beautiful as the great beauties who must have inevitablythrown themselves at his head."
15615,8,My little spurt of intellectual interestwas of course making me fit to be a brilliant ornament of any salon.I know now it was absurd.
15616,8,"Though Stahr’s education was foundedon nothing more than a night-school course in stenography, he had a—THE LAST TYCOONi8long time ago run ahead through trackless wastes of perception intofields where very few men were able to follow him."
15617,8,"But in my reck-my grey eyes against his brown ones for guile,my young golf-and-tennis heart-beats against his, which must beslowing a litde after years of over-work."
15618,8,"And I planned and I contrived and I plotted—any woman can tell you—-but it never cameless conceit I matchedto anything, as you will see."
15619,8,"I still like to think that if he’d been apoor boy and nearer my age I could have managed it, but of coursethe real truth was that I had nothing to offer that he didn’t have;some of my more romantic ideas actually stemmed from picturesjp.nd Street, for example, had a great influence on me."
15620,8,It’s more thanpossible that some of the pictures which Stahr himself conceived hadshaped me into what I was.So it was rather hopeless.
15621,8,"Emotionally, at least, people can’t liveby taking in each other’s washing.But at that time it was different: Father might help, the stewardessmight help."
15622,8,"She might go up in the cockpit and say to Stahr: “If Iever saw love, it’s in that girl’s eyes.”The pilot might help: “Man, are you blind? Why don’t you goback there?”Wylie White might help instead of standing in the aisle lookingat me doubtfully, wondering whether I was awake or asleep.“Sit down,” I said."
15623,8,"“What’s new?—where are we?”—“Up in the air.”“Oh, so that’s it."
15624,8,"Sit down.” I tried to show a cheerful interest;“What are you writing?”—The Boy“Heaven help me, I am writing about a Boy ScoutScout.”“Is it Stain’s idea?”“I don’tknow—he told me to look into it."
15625,8,"He may have tenwriters working ahead of me or behind me, a system which he sothoughtfully invented."
15626,8,"So you’re in love with him?”“I should say not,” I said indignantly."
15627,8,"“I’ve known him allmylife.”“Desperate, eh? Well, I’ll arrange it if you’ll use all your influ-ence to advance me."
15628,8,I want a unit of my own.”I closedmy eyes again and drifted off.
15629,8,"When I woke up, thestewardess was putting a blanket over me.”THE LAST TYCOON19“Almost there,” she said.Out the window I could see by the sunset that we were in agreener land.“I just heardsomething funny,” she volunteered, “up in the——that Mr."
15630,8,Smith—or Mr.
15631,8,"Stahr— never remember seeinghis namecockpitI“It’s never on any pictures,” I said.“Oh."
15632,8,"Well, he’s been asking the pilots a lot about flying—I meanhe’s interested? You \nou/V’“I know.”“I mean one of them told me he bet he could teach Mr."
15633,8,"StahrHe has such a fine mentality, that’s whathe said.”I was getting impatient.“Well, what was so funny?”“Well, finally one of the pilots asked Mr."
15634,8,"Smith if he liked hisbusiness, and Mr."
15635,8,"Smith said, ‘Sure."
15636,8,Sure I like it.
15637,8,It’s nice being the”only sound nut in a hatful of cracked ones.’The stewardess doubled up with laughter and I could have spitsolo flying in ten minutes.—at her.“I mean calling all those people a hatful of nuts.
15638,8,"I mean crackednuts.”Her laughter stopped with unexpected suddenness, and herface was grave as she stood up."
15639,8,"“Well, I’ve got to finish my chart.”“Goodbye.”Obviously Stahr had put the pilots right up on the throne withhim and let them rule with him for awhile."
15640,8,"Years later I travelledwith one of those same pilots and he told me one thing Stahr hadsaid.He was looking down at the mountains.“Suppose you were a railroad man,” he said."
15641,8,“You have to senda train through there somewhere.
15642,8,"Well, you get your surveyors*reports, and you find there’s three or four or half a dozen gaps, and—not one is better than the other."
15643,8,You’ve got to decide on what basis?You can’t test the best way—except by doing it.
15644,8,So you just do it.91The pilot thought he had missed something.“How do you mean?”“You choose some one way for no reason at all—because thatmountain’s pink or the blueprint is a better blue.
15645,8,You see?”THE LAST TYCOON20The pilot considered that this was very valuable advice.
15646,8,"But hedoubted if he’d ever be in a position to apply it.“What I wanted to know,” he told me ruefully, “is how he evergot to be Mr."
15647,8,Stahr.”Fm afraid Stahr could never have answered that one; for theembryo is not equipped with a memory.
15648,8,"But I could answer a little.He had flown up very high to see, on strong wings, when he wasyoung."
15649,8,"And while he was up there he had looked on all the kingdoms, with the kind of eyes that can stare straight into the sun.and keeping onbeating them, he had stayed up there longer than most of us, andthen, remembering all he had seen from his great height of howBeating his wings tenaciously—finally frantically—things were, he had settled gradually to earth.The motors were off, and all our five senses began to readjustI could see a line of lights for the Longthemselves for landing.Beach Naval Station ahead and to the left, and on the right a twinkling blur for Santa Monica."
15650,8,"The California moon was out, huge andorange over the Pacific."
15651,8,"However I happened to feel about thesethings and they were home, after all I know that Stahr must havefelt much more."
15652,8,"These were the things I had first opened my eyeson, like the sheep on the back lot of the old Laemmle studio; butthis was where Stahr had come to earth after that extraordinaryilluminating flight where he saw which way we were going, andhow we looked doing it, and how much of it mattered."
15653,8,"You couldsay that this was where an accidental wind blew him, but I don’t——think so."
15654,8,"I would rather think that in a “long shot” he saw a newway of measuring our jerky hopes and graceful rogueries and awkward sorrows, and that he came here from choice to be with us tothe end."
15655,8,"Like the plane coming down into the Glendale airport,into the warm darkness.CHAPTER IIIt was nine o’clock of a July night and there were still some extras— couldin the drug-store across from the studioIsee them bent overthe pin-games inside—as I parked my car."
15656,8,"“Old” JohnnySwansonstood on the corner in his semi-cowboy clothes, staring gloomilypast the moon."
15657,8,"Once he had been as big in pictures asTom Mixor Bill Hart*—now it was too sad to speak to him, and I hurriedacross the street and through the front gate.There is never a time when a studio is absolutely quiet."
15658,8,"There isalways a night shift of technicians in the laboratories and dubbingrooms and people on the maintenance staff dropping in at the comthe padded hush of tires,the quiet tick of a motor running idle, the naked cry of a sopranosinging into a nightbound microphone."
15659,8,Around a corner I cameupon a man in rubber boots washing down a car in a wonderfulmissary.

15663,8,"Fatherwas on the second floor, with Stahr on one side and Mr."
15664,8,Marcus onthe other this evening there were lights all along the row.
15665,8,"Mystomach dipped a little at the proximity to Stahr, but that was inpretty good control now—I’d seen him only once in the month I’dbeen home.There were a lot of strange things about Father’s office, but I’llmake it brief."
15666,8,"In the outer part were three poker-faced secretaries whothis because she kept singing the—THE LAST TYCOON22hadsat there likePeters,witches ever sinceIcould remember—BirdyMaude something, and Rosemary Schmiel; I don’t knowwhether this was her name, but she was the dean of the trio, so tospeak, and under her desk was the kick-lock that admitted you towere passionateand Birdy had invented the rule that if typists wereseen eating together more than once in a single week, they werehauled up on the carpet."
15667,8,At that time the studios feared mob rule.I went on in.
15668,8,"Nowadays all chief executives have huge drawingrooms, but my father’s was the first."
15669,8,"It was also the first to haveone-way glass in the big French windows, and I’ve heard a storyabout a trap in the floor that would drop unpleasant visitors to anoubliette below, but believe it to be an invention."
15670,8,"There was a bigpainting of Will Rogers, hung conspicuously and intended, I think,Father’s throne room."

15673,8,"Tonight the one-way French windows were openand a big moon, rosy-gold with a haze around, was wedged helplessin one of them."
15674,8,"Father and Jacques La Borwitz and RosemarySchmiel were down at the end around a big circular desk.What did Father look like?Icouldn’t describe him except foronce in New York when I met him where I didn’t expect to; I wasaware of a bulky, middle-aged man who looked a little ashamed of—himself, and I wished he’d move onand then I saw he was Father.Afterward I was shocked at my impression."
15675,8,"Father can be verymagnetic he has a tough jaw and an Irish smile.—But as for Jacques La Borwitz, I shall spare you."
15676,8,"Let me just sayhe was an assistant producer, which is something like a commissar,and let it go at that."
15677,8,"Where Stahr picked up such mental cadavers orhad them forced upon him or especially how he got any use outof them—has always amazed me, as it amazed everyone fresh fromthe East who slapped up against them."
15678,8,"Jacques La Borwitz had hispoints, no doubt, but so have the sub-microscopic protozoa, so has adog prowling for a bitch and a bone."
15679,8,Jacques La—oh my!From their expressions I was sure they had been talking aboutStahr.
15680,8,"Stahr had ordered something or forbidden something, ordefied Father or junked one of La Borwitz’ pictures or something—THE LAST TYCOON23and they were sitting there in protest at night in acommunity of rebellion and helplessness."
15681,8,"Rosemary Schmiel sat padcatastrophic,in hand, as if ready to write down their dejection.“I’m to drive you home dead or alive,” I told Father."
15682,8,“All thosebirthday presents rotting away in their packages!”“A birthday!” cried Jacques in a flurry of apology.
15683,8,"“How old?I didn’t know.”“Forty-three,” said Father distinctly.He was older than that—four years—and Jacques knew it; Isaw him note it down in his account book to use some time."
15684,8,Out herethese account books are carried open in the hand.
15685,8,"One can see theentries beingmade without recourse to lip-reading, and RosemarySchmiel was compelled in emulation to make a mark on her pad.As she rubbed it out, the earth quaked under us.We didn’t get the full shock like at Long Beach, where the upperstories of shops were spewed into the streets and small hotels driftedout to sea—but for a full minute our bowels were one with thebowels of the earth—like some nightmare attempt to attach ournavel cords again and jerk us back to the womb of creation.Mother’s picture fell off the wall, revealing a small safe—Rosemaryand I grabbed frantically for each other and did a strange screamingwaltz across the room."
15686,8,"Jacques fainted or at least disappeared, andFather clung to his desk and shouted, “Are you all right?” Outsidethe window the singer came to the climax of I love you only, held ita moment and then, I swear, started it all over."
15687,8,"Or maybe they wereplaying it back to her from the recording machine.The room stood still, shimmying a litde."
15688,8,"We made our way to thedoor, suddenly including Jacques, who had reappeared, and totteredout dizzily through the anteroom on to the iron balcony."
15689,8,"Almost allthe lights were out, and from here and there we could hear cries andthen, ascalls."
15690,8,"Momentarily we stood waiting for a second shock—with a common impulse, we went into Stahr’s entry and through tohis office.The office was big, but not as big as Father’s."
15691,8,Stahr sat on the sideof his couch rubbing his eyes.
15692,8,"When the quake came he had beenasleep, and he wasn’t sure yet whether he had dreamed it.When weconvinced him he thought it was all rather funny—until the tele-phones began to ring."
15693,8,"I watched him as unobtrusively as possible.THE LAST TYCOON24He was grey with fatigue while he listened to the phone and dictograph; but as the reports came in, his eyes began to pick up shine.“they’recouple of water mains have burst,” he said to Father,“—Aheading into the back lot.”“Gray’s shooting in the French Village,” said Father.“It’sflooded around the Station, too, and in the Jungle and theCity Corner."
15694,8,"What the hell—nobody seems to be hurt.” In passing,he shook my hands gravely: “Where’ve you been, Cecilia?”“You going out there, Monroe?” Father asked.“When all the news is in.' One of the power lines is off, too—I’vesent for Robinson.”He made me sit down with him on the couch and tell about thequake again.“You look tired,” I said, cute and motherly.“Yes,” he agreed, “I’ve got no place to go in the evenings, so Ijustwork“I’ll”arrange some evenings for you.”“I used to play poker with a gang,” he said thoughtfully, “beforeI was married."
15695,8,"But they all drank themselves to death.”Miss Doolan, his secretary, came in with fresh bad news.“Robby’U take care of everything when he comes,” Stahr assuredthat Robinson."

15697,8,He’ll be here in a minute you’ll likeFather.
15698,8,He turned to me.
15699,8,"“Now there’s a man———Robby.”He said it as if it had been his life-long intention to bring ustogether, and he had arranged the whole earthquake with just thatin mind.“Yes, you’ll like Robby,” he repeated."
15700,8,"“When do you go back tocollege?”“I’ve just come home.”“You get the whole summer?”“I’m sorry,” I said."
15701,8,“I’ll go back as soon as I can.”I was in a mist.

15703,8,"That’s what I was trying to say.”And I think I was about to sing out eagerly that I needn’t go backat all, that Iwas quite educated already—when the totally admirableRobinson came in."
15704,8,"He was a bowlegged young redhead, all readyto go.“This is Robby, Cecilia,” said Stahr."
15705,8,"“Come on, Robby.”—itSo I met Robby."
15706,8,I can’t say it seemed like fate but it was.
15707,8,"Forwas Robby who later told me how Stahr found his love that night.—Under the moon the back lot was thirty acres of fairyland notbecause the locations really looked like African jungles and Frenchchateaux and schooners at anchor and Broadway by night, butbecause they looked like the torn picture books of childhood, likefragments of stories dancing in an open fire."
15708,8,"I never lived in a housewith an attic, but a back lot must be something like that, and at nightof course in an enchanted distorted way, it all comes true.When Stahr and Robby arrived, clusters of lights had alreadypicked out the danger spots in the flood.“Well pump it out into the swamp on Thirty-Sixth Street,” saidRobby after a moment."
15709,8,"“It’s city property—but isn’t this an act ofGod? Say—look there!”On top of a huge head of the Goddess Siva, two women werefloating down the current of an impromptu river."
15710,8,"The idol had comeunloosed from a set of Burma, and it meandered earnesdy on itsway, stopping sometimes to waddle and bump in the shallows withthe other debris of the tide."
15711,8,"The two refugees had found sanctuaryalong a scroll of curls on its bald forehead and seemed at first glanceto be sightseers on an interesting bus-ride through the scene of theflood.“Will you look at that, Monroe!” said Robby."
15712,8,"“Look at thosedames!”Dragging their legs through sudden bogs, they made their wayto the bank of the stream."
15713,8,"Now they could see the women, lookinga little scared but brightening at the prospect of rescue.“We ought to let ’em drift out to the waste pipe,” said Robbygallantly, “but DeMille needs that head next week.”He wouldn’t have hurt a fly, though, and presently he was hip—THE LAST TYCOON26deep in the water, fishing for them with a pole and succeeding onlyin spinning it in a dizzy circle."
15714,8,"Help arrived, and the impressionquickly got around that one of them was very pretty, and then thatthey were people of importance."
15715,8,"But they were just strays, and Robbywaited disgustedly to give them hell while the thing was broughtfinally into control and beached.“Put that head back!” he called up to them."
15716,8,"“You think it’s asouvenir?”One of the women came sliding smoothly down the cheek of theidol,and Robby caught and set her on solid ground; the other onehesitated and then followed."
15717,8,"Robby turned to Stahr for judgment.“What’ll we do with them, chief?”Stahr did not answer."
15718,8,"Smiling faintly at him from not four feetaway was the face of his dead wife, identical even to the expression.Across the four feet of moonlight, the eyes he knew looked backat him, a curl blew a little on a familiar forehead; the smile lingered,—changed a little according to pattern; the lips parted the same."

15752,8,I loved Fathergraph with many low swoops—butIsort of irregularbegan to see that his strongwill didn’t fill him out as a passable man.
15753,8,Most of what he accom-plished boileddown to shrewd.
15754,8,He had acquired with luck andshrewdness a quarter interest in a booming circus—together withyoung Stahr.
15755,8,That was his life’s effort—all the rest was an instinctto hang on.
15756,8,"Of course, he talked that double talk to Wall Streetabout how mysterious it was to make a picture, but Father didn’tknow the ABC’s of dubbing or even cutting."
15757,8,"Nor had he learnedmuch about the feel of America as a bar boy in Ballyhegan, nor didhe have any more than a drummer’s sense of a story."
15758,8,"On the otherhand, he didn’t have concealed paresis likehe came to the;studio before noon, and, with a suspiciousness developed like amuscle, it was hard to put anything over on him.—Stahr had been his luck and Stahr was something else again."
15759,8,Hewas a marker in industry like Edison and Lumiere and Griffith andChaplin.
15760,8,"He led pictures way up past the range and power of thetheatre, reaching a sort of golden age, before the censorship.Proof of his leadership was the spying that went on around him—notjust for insideinformation or patented process secrets—-butspying on his scent for a trend in taste, his guess as to how thingswere going to be."
15761,8,Too much of his vitality was taken by the mereparrying of these attempts.
15762,8,"It made his work secret in part, oftendevious, slow—and hard to describe as the plans of a general, wherethe psychological factors become too tenuous and we end by merelyadding up the successes and failures."
15763,8,"But I have determined to giveyou a glimpse of him functioning, which is my excuse for whatfollows."
15764,8,It is drawn partly from a paper I wrote in college on ATHE LAST TYCOON29Producer's Day and partly from my imagination.
15765,8,"More often I haveblocked in the ordinary events myself, while the stranger ones aretrue.In the early morning after the flood, a man walked up to theoutside balcony of the Administration Building."
15766,8,"He lingered theresome time, according to an eyewitness, then mounted to the ironrailing anddove head first to the pavement below."
15767,8,"Breakage—onearm.Miss Doolan, Stahr’s secretary, told him about it when he buzzedfor her at nine.He had slept in his office without hearing the smallcommotion.“Pete Zavras!” Stahr exclaimed, “—the camera man?”“They took him to a doctors office."
15768,8,"It won’t be in the paper.”“Hell of a thing,” he said."
15769,8,“I knew he’d gone to pot—but I don’tknow why.
15770,8,"He was all right when we used him two years agowhy should he come here? How did he get in?”“He bluffed it with his old studio pass,” said Catherine Doolan.She was a dry hawk, the wife of an assistant director."
15771,8,"“Perhaps thequake had something to do with it.”“He was the best camera man in town,” Stahr said."
15772,8,"When he hadheard of the hundreds dead at Long Beach, he was still haunted bythe abortive suicide at dawn."
15773,8,He told Catherine Doolan to tracethe matter down.The first dictograph messages blew in through the warm morning.
15774,8,"While he shaved and had coffee, he talked and listened."
15775,8,Robbyhad left a message: “If Mr.
15776,8,Stahr wants me tell him to hell withit I’m in bed.” An actor was sick or thought so; the Governor ofCalifornia was bringing a party out; a supervisor had beaten up hiswife for the prints and must be “reduced to a writer”—these threeaffairs were Father’s jobunless the actor was under personal contract to Stahr.
15777,8,"There was early snow on a location in Canada withthe company already there—Stahr raced over the possibilities of—salvage, reviewing the story of the picture."
15778,8,Nothing.
15779,8,Stahr calledCatherine Doolan.“I want to speak to the cop who put two women off the back lotlast night.
15780,8,"I think his name’s Malone.”“Yes, Mr."
15781,8,Stahr.
15782,8,"I’ve got JoeWyman—about the trousers.”THE LAST TYCOON3°‘‘Hello, Joe,” said Stahr.“Listen—two people at the sneak pre-view complained that Morgan’s fly was open for half the picture* of course they’re exaggerating, but even if it’s only ten feet.....no, we can’t find the people, but I want that picture run over andover until you find that footage."
15783,8,"Get a lot of people in the projectionroom—somebody’ll spot it.”—“Tout passe Hart robuste”Seul a VeternitS.“And there’s the Prince from Denmark,” said Catherine Doolan.“He’s very handsome.” She was impelled to add poindessly, “—for atall man.”“Thanks,” Stahrsaid.“Thank you, Catherine, I appreciate itthat I am now the handsomest small man on the lot."
15784,8,Send the Princeout on the sets and tell him we’ll lunch at one.”“And Mr.

15786,8,"Or anything so they could be traced.”“Anything else?”“No, but tell him it’s important while he still remembers."
15787,8,"Whatwere they? I mean what kind of people—ask him that, too."
15788,8,"I mean”were theyShe waited, scratching his words on her pad without looking.“—oh, were they questionable? Were they theatrical? Never—mind—skip that."
15789,8,"Just ask if he knows how they can be traced.”The policeman, Malone, had known nothing."
15790,8,"Two dames, andhe had hustled ’em, you betcha."
15791,8,One of them was sore.
15792,8,Which one?One of them.
15793,8,"They had a car, a Chewy—he thought of taking thelicense."
15794,8,Was itthe good looker who was sore? It was one of them.Not which one—he had noticed nothing.
15795,8,Even on the lot hereMinna was forgotten.
15796,8,In three years.
15797,8,"So much for that, then.—Stahr smiled at Mr."
15798,8,George Boxley.
15799,8,It was a kindly fatherly smileStahr had developed inversely when he was a young man pushedTHE LAST TYCOONinto high places.
15800,8,"Originally it31had been a smile of respect towardhis elders, then as his own decisions grew rapidly to displace theirs,a smile so that they should not feel it—finally emerging as what itwas: a smile of kindness—sometimes a little hurried and tired, butalways there—toward anyone who had not angered him within thehour."
15801,8,"Or anyone he did not intend to insult, aggressive and outright.Mr."
15802,8,Boxley did not smile back.
15803,8,"He came in with the air of beingviolendy dragged, though no one apparently had a hand on him.He stood in front of a chair, and again it was as if two invisibleattendants seized his arms and set him down forcibly into it."
15804,8,He satthere morosely.
15805,8,"Even when he lit a cigarette on Stahr’s invitation,one felt that the match was held to it by exterior forces he disdainedto control.Stahr looked at him courteously.“Something not going well, Mr."
15806,8,"Boxley ?”The novelist looked back at him in thunderous silence.“I read your letter,” said Stahr."
15807,8,The tone of the pleasant youngheadmaster was gone.
15808,8,"He spoke as to an equal, but with a faint two-edged deference.“I can’t get what I writeallon paper,” broke out Boxley."
15809,8,"“You’vebeen very decent, but it’s a sort of conspiracy."
15810,8,"Those two hacks—theyyou’ve teamed me with listen to what I say, but they spoil itseem to have a vocabulary of about a hundred words.”“Why don’t you write it yourself?” asked Stahr.“I have."
15811,8,"I sent you some.”“But it was just talk, back and forth,” said Stahr mildly."
15812,8,"“Interesting talk but nothing more.”Now it was all the two ghosdy attendants could do to hold Boxleyin the deep chair.He struggled to get up; he uttered a single quietbark which had some relation to laughter but none to amusement,and said:“I don’t think you people read things."
15813,8,The men are duelling whenthe conversation takes place.
15814,8,"At the end one of them falls into awell and has to be hauled up in a bucket.”He barked again and subsided.“Would you write that in a book of your own, Mr."
15815,8,"Boxley?”“What? Naturally not.”“You’d consider it too cheap.”THE LAST TYCOON32Movie standards are different,” said Boxley, hedging.“Do you ever go to them?”“No—almost never.”“Isn’t it because people arealways duelling and fallingdownwells?”“Yes—and wearing strained facial expressions and talking incredibleand unnatural dialogue.”“Skip the dialogue for a minute,” said Stahr."
15816,8,“Granted yourdialogue is more graceful than what these hacks can write that’s—why we brought you out here.
15817,8,But let’s imagine something thatisn’t either bad dialogue or jumping down a well.
15818,8,"Has your officegot a stove in it that lights with a match?”“I think it has,” said Boxley stiffly, “—but I never use it.”“Suppose you’re in your office."
15819,8,You’ve been fighting duels or writing all day and you’re too tired to fight or write any more.
15820,8,"You’reprettysitting there staring—dull, like we all get sometimes.Astenographer that you’ve seen before comes into the room and youwatch her—idly."
15821,8,"She doesn’t see you, though you’re very close toher."
15822,8,"She takes off her gloves, opens her purse and dumps it out ona table•”Stahr stood up, tossing his key-ring on his desk.—“She has two dimes and a nickel and a cardboard match box.She leaves the nickel on the desk, puts the two dimes back into herpurse and takes her black gloves to the stove, opens it and puts theminside."
15823,8,There is one match in the match box and she starts to lightit kneeling by the stove.
15824,8,You notice that there’s a stiff wind blowingin the window—but just then your telephone rings.
15825,8,"The girl picks——listensand says deliberately into the phone, ‘I’venever owned a pair of black gloves in my life.’ She hangs up, kneelsit up, says helloby the stove again, and just as she lights the match, you glancearound very suddenly and see that there’s another man in the office,”watching every move the girl makesStahr paused."
15826,8,"He picked up his keys and put them in hispocket.“Go on,” said Boxley smiling."
15827,8,"“What happens?”“I don’t know,” said Stahr."
15828,8,"“I was just making pictures.”Boxley felt he was being put in the wrong.“It’s justmelodrama,” he said.THE LAST TYCOON33“Not necessarily,” said Stahr."
15829,8,"“In any case, nobody has movedviolently or talked cheap dialogue or had any facial expression at all.There was only one bad line, and a writer like you could improve it.But you were interested.”“What was the nickel for?” asked Boxley evasively.“I don’t know,” said Stahr."
15830,8,Suddenly he laughed.
15831,8,"“Oh, yes—thenickel was for the movies.”The two invisible attendants seemed to release Boxley."
15832,8,"He relaxed,leaned back in his chair and laughed.“What in hell do you pay me for?” he demanded."
15833,8,"“I don’t understand the damn stuff.”“You will,” said Stahr grinning, “or you wouldn’t have askedabout the nickel.”A dark saucer-eyed man was waiting in the outer office as theycame out.“Mr."
15834,8,"Boxley, this is Mr."
15835,8,"Mike Van Dyke,” Stahr said."
15836,8,"“What isit,Mike?”“Nothing,” Mike said."
15837,8,“I just came up to see if you were real.”“Why don’t you go to work?” Stahr said.
15838,8,"“I haven’t had a laughin the rushes for days.”“I’m afraid of a nervous breakdown.”“You ought to keep in form,” Stahr said."
15839,8,“Let’s see you peddleyour stuff.” He turned to Boxley: “Mike’s a gag man—he was outhere when I was in the cradle.
15840,8,"Mike, show Mr."
15841,8,"Boxley a doublewing, clutch, kick and scram.”“Here?” asked Mike.“Here.””“There isn’t much room."
15842,8,"I wanted to ask you about“There’s lot of room.”“Well,” he looked around tentatively."
15843,8,"“You shoot the gun.”Miss Doolan’s assistant, Katy, took a paper bag, blew it open.“•back in the Keystone“It was a routine,” Mike said to Boxley,—days.”“ItHe turned to Stahr: “Does he know what a routine is?”means an act,” Stahr explained."

15845,8,Mikestood with his back to her.THE LAST TYCOON34“Ready?” Katy asked.
15846,8,"She brought her hands down on the side.Immediately Mike grabbed his bottom with both hands, jumped inthe air, slid his feet out on the floor one after the other, remaining inplace and flapping his arms twice like a bird“Double wing,” said Stahr.—and then ran out the screen door which theoffice boy held openfor him and disappeared past the window of the balcony.“Mr."
15847,8,"Stahr,” said Miss Doolan, “Mr."
15848,8,"Hanson is on the phonefrom New York.”Ten minutes later he clicked his dictograph, and Miss Doolancame in."
15849,8,"There was a male star waiting to see him in the outer office.Miss Doolan said.“Tell him I went out by the balcony,” Stahr advised her.“All right."
15850,8,He’s been in four times this week.
15851,8,He seems veryanxious.”“Did he give you any hint of what he wanted? Isn’t it something he can see Mr.
15852,8,Brady about?”“He didn’t say.
15853,8,You have a conference coming up.
15854,8,Miss Meloneyand Mr.

15858,8,Reinmund’s office.”“Send Mr.
15859,8,"Roderiguez in,” said Stahr."
15860,8,"“Tell him I can see himonly for a minute.”When the handsome actor came in, Stahr remained standing.“What is it that can’t wait?” he asked pleasandy.The actor waited carefully till Miss Doolan had gone out.”“Monroe, I’m through,” he said."
15861,8,“I had to see you“Through!” said Stahr.
15862,8,“Have you seen Variety ? Your picture’sheld over at Roxy’s and did thirty-seven thousand in Chicago lastweek.”“That’s the worst of it.
15863,8,"That’s the tragedy.Iget everything Iwant, and now it means nothing.”“Well, go on, explain.”“There’s nothing between Esther and me any more."
15864,8,"There nevercan be again.”“A row.”“Oh, no—worse—I can’t bear to mention it."
15865,8,My head’s in a daze.I wander around like a madman.
15866,8,"I go through my part as if I wasasleep.”THE LAST TYCOON35“I haven’t noticed it,” said Stahr."
15867,8,“You were great in your rushesyesterday.”“Was I? That just shows you nobody ever guesses.”“Are you trying totellme that you and Esther are separat-ing?”“I suppose it’ll come to that.
15868,8,Yes—inevitably—it will.”“What was it?” demanded Stahr impatiently.
15869,8,"“Did she come inwithout knocking?”“Oh, there’s nobody else."
15870,8,It’s just—me.
15871,8,"I’m through.”Stahr got it suddenly.“How do you know?”“It’s been true for six weeks.”“It’s your imagination,” said Stahr."
15872,8,“Have you been to a doctor?”The actor nodded.“I’ve tried everything.
15873,8,Ieven—one day in desperation I wentdown to—to Claris.
15874,8,But it was hopeless.
15875,8,I’m washed up.”Stahr had an impish temptation to tell him to go to Brady aboutit.Brady handled all matters of public relations.
15876,8,"Or was this privateHe turned away a moment, got his face in control, turnedrelations.back.“I’ve been to Pat Brady,” said the star, as if guessing the thought.“He gave me a lot of phoney advice and I tried it all, but nothingdoing."
15877,8,"Esther and I sit opposite each other at dinner, and I’mashamed to look at her."
15878,8,"She’s been a good sport about it, but I’mashamed."
15879,8,I’m ashamed all day long.
15880,8,I think Rainy Day grossedtwenty-five thousand in Des Moines and broke all records in St.Louis and did twenty-seven thousand in Kansas City.
15881,8,"My fan mail’sway up, and there I am afraid to go home at night, afraid to goto bed.”Stahr began to be faindy oppressed."
15882,8,"When the actor first came in,Stahr had intended to invite him to a cocktail party, but now itscarcely seemed appropriate."
15883,8,"What would he want with a cocktailparty with this hanging over him? In his mind’s eye he saw himwandering haunted from guest to guest with a cocktail in his handand his grosses up twenty-seven thousand.“So I came to you, Monroe."
15884,8,I never saw a situation where youdidn’t know a way out.
15885,8,"I said to myself: even if he advises me tokill myself, I’ll askMonroe.”THE LAST TYCOON36The buzzer sounded on Stahr’s desk—he switched on the dictograph and heard Miss Doolan ’$ voice,”“Five minutes, Mr."
15886,8,"Stahr“I’m sorry,” said Stahr, “I’ll need a few minutes more.”“Five hundred girls marched to my house from the high school,”the actor said gloomily, “andI stood behind the curtains andwatched them."
15887,8,"I couldn’t go out.”“You sit down,” said Stahr."
15888,8,"“We’ll take plenty of time and talkthis over.”In the outer office, two members of the conference group had—Wylie White and Jane Meloney."
15889,8,"Thewas a dried-up little blonde of fifty about whom one couldalready waited ten minuteslatterhear the fifty assorted opinions of Hollywood—“a sentimental dope,”“the best writer on construction in Hollywood,” “a veteran,” “thatold hack,” “the smartest woman on the lot,” “the cleverest plagiaristin the biz”; and, of course, in addition she was variously described asa nymphomaniac, a virgin, a pushover, a Lesbian and a faithful wife.Without being an old maid, she was."
15890,8,"like most self-made women,rather old maidish."
15891,8,"She had ulcers ot the stomach, and her salarywas over a hundred thousand a year."
15892,8,A complicated treatise couldbe written on whether she was “worth it” or more than that ornothing at all.
15893,8,"Her value lay in such ordinary assets as the bare factthat she was a woman and adaptable, quick and trustworthy, “knewthe game” and was without egotism."
15894,8,"She had been a great friend ofMinna’s, and over a period of years Stahr had managed to stifle whatamounted to a sharp physical revulsion.She and Wylie waited in silence occasionally addressing aremark to Miss Doolan."
15895,8,"Every few minutes Reinmund, the supervisor, called up from his office, where he and Broaca, the director,were waiting."
15896,8,"After ten minutes Stahr’s button went on, and MissDoolan called Reinmund and Broaca; simultaneously Stahr and theactor came out of Stahr’s office with Stahr holding the man’s arm.He was so wound up now that when Wylie White asked him howhe was he opened his mouth and began to tell him then and there.“Oh, I’ve had an awful time,” he said, but Stahr interrupted—sharply.“No, you haven’t."
15897,8,"Now you go along and do the role the way Isaid.”“Thank you, Monroe.”THE LAST TYCOON37Jane Meloney looked after him without speaking.“Somebody been catching flies on him?” she asked— phrase forastealing scenes.‘Tm sorry I kept you waiting,” Stahr said."
15898,8,“Come on in.”It was noon already and the conferees were entided to exactly anhour of Stahr’s time.
15899,8,"No less, for such a conference could only beinterrupted by a director who was held up in his shooting; seldommuch more, because every eight days the company must release aproduction as complex and cosdy as Reinhardt’s Miracle.Occasionally, less often than five years ago, Stahr would work allthrough the night on a single picture."
15900,8,But after such a spree he feltbadly for days.
15901,8,"If he could go from problem to problem, there wasa certain rebirth of vitality with each change."
15902,8,"And like those sleeperswho can wake whenever they wish, he had set his psychologicalclock to run one hour.The cast assembled included, besides the writers, Reinmund, oneof the most favored of the supervisors, and John Broaca, the picture’sdirector.Broaca,on thesurface,wasnerves, quietly resolute, popular.allengineer—large and withoutHe was an ignoramus, and Stahr—often caught him making the same scenes over and over one sceneabout a rich young girl occurred in all his pictures with the sameA bunch of large dogs entered the roomand jumped around the girl."

15904,8,The explanation was probably notFreudian; more likely that at a drab moment in youth he had lookedthrough a fence and seen a beautiful girl with dogs and horses.
15905,8,"Asa trademark for glamor it was stamped on his brain forever.Reinmund was a handsome young opportunist, with a fairly goodeducation."
15906,8,"Originally a man of some character, he was being dailyforced by his anomalous position into devious ways of acting andthinking."
15907,8,"He was a bad man now, as men go."
15908,8,"At thirty he had noneof the virtues which either gentile Americans or Jews are taughtto think admirable.But he got his pictures out in time, and bymanifesting an almost homosexual fixation on Stahr, seemed to havedulled Stahr’s usual acuteness."
15909,8,"Stahr liked him—considered him agood all-around man.Wylie White, of course, in any country would have been recog-THE LAST TYCOON38nizable as an intellectual o £ the second order."
15910,8,"He was civilized andvoluble, both simple and acute, half dazed and half saturnine."
15911,8,"Hisjealousy of Stahrshowed onlyinunguardedflashes,and wasmingled with admiration and even affection.“The production date for this picture is two weeks from Saturday,” said Stahr."
15912,8,"“I think basically it’s all right—much improved.”Reinmund and the two writers exchanged a glance of congratulation.“Except for one thing,” said Stahr, thoughtfully."
15913,8,"“I don’t see whyproduced at all, and I’ve decided to put it away.”There was a moment of shocked silence and then murmurs ofit should be—protest, stricken queries.“It’snot your fault,” Stahr said."

15915,8,"We paidfully at Reinmund: “It’s too badall.”itfiftythousand for it.”“What’s the matter with it, Monroe?” asked Broaca bluntly.“Well, it hardly seems worth while to go into it,” said Stahr.Reinmund and Wylie White were both thinking of the profesReinmund had two pictures to his accountthis year but Wylie White needed a credit to start his comebacksional effect on them.—to the scene.Jane Meloney was watching Stahr closely from littleskull-like eyes.“Couldn’t you give us some clue,” Reinmund asked."

15917,8,“Or”Colman either.
15918,8,"I wouldn’t advise them to play it“Specifically, Monroe,” begged Wylie White."
15919,8,"“What didn’t youlike? The scenes? the dialogue? the humor? construction?”Stahr picked up the script from his desk, let it fall as if it were,physically, too heavy to handle.“I don’t like the people,” he said."
15920,8,"“I wouldn’t like to meet them—if I knew they were going to be somewhere, I’d go somewhereelse.”Reinmund smiled, but there was worry in his eyes.“Well, that’s a damning criticism,” he said."
15921,8,"“I thought the peoplewere rather interesting.”“So did I,” said Broaca."
15922,8,“I thought Em was very sympathetic.”—THE LAST TYCOON39“Did you?” asked Stahr sharply.
15923,8,“I could just barely believe she”was alive.
15924,8,"And when I came to the end, I said to myself, ‘So what?’“There must be something to do,” Reinmund said."
15925,8,“Naturally”we feel bad about this.
15926,8,"This is the structure we agreed on“But it’s not the story,” said Stahr."
15927,8,"“I’ve told you many timesWe changein every other regard, but once that is set we’ve got to work towardit with every line and movement."
15928,8,This is not the kind of a story Iwant.

15933,8,"“You see, Monroe, Idon’t think stenographers have the same dumb admiration for theirbosses they had in 1929."
15934,8,They’ve been laid off—they’ve seen theirbosses jittery.
15935,8,"The world has moved on, that’s all.”Stahr looked at him impatiently, gave a short nod.“That’s not under discussion,” he said.“The premise of thisstory is that the girl did have dumb admiration for her boss, if youwant to call it that."
15936,8,And there wasn’t any evidence that he’d everbeen jittery.

15942,8,"She had been inthis game longer than any of them except Broaca, with whom shehad had a three-day affair twenty years ago.Stahr turned to Reinmund.“You ought to have understood from the casting, Reiny, whatkind of a picture I wanted."

15949,8,I feel bad aboutthis.
15950,8,Ishould have warned Wylie.
15951,8,"I thought he had some goodideas.”“Monroe’s right,” said Broaca bluntly."
15952,8,"“I felt this was wrong allthe time, but I couldn’t put my finger on it.”Wylie and Rose looked at him contemptuously and exchanged aglance.“Do you writers think you can get hot on it again?” asked Stahr,not unkindly."
15953,8,"“Or shall I try somebody fresh?”“I’d like another shot,” said Wylie.“How about you, Jane?”She nodded briefly.“What do you think of the girl?” asked Stahr.“Well—naturally I’m prejudiced in her favor.”“You better forget it,” said Stahr warningly."
15954,8,“Ten million Americans would put thumbs down on that girl if she walked on thescreen.

15956,8,"If you want to paint a scarlet letter on her back, it’sall right, but that’s another story."

15963,8,"Amory Blaine inherited from his mother every trait, except the stray inexpressible few, that made him worthwhile."
15964,8,"His father, an ineffectual, inarticulate man with a taste for Byron and a habit of drowsing over the Encyclopedia Britannica, grew wealthy at thirty through the death of two elder brothers, successful Chicago brokers, and in the first flush of feeling that the world was his, went to Bar Harbor and met Beatrice O’Hara."
15965,8,"In consequence, Stephen Blaine handed down to posterity his height of just under six feet and his tendency to waver at crucial moments, these two abstractions appearing in his son Amory."
15966,8,"For many years he hovered in the background of his family’s life, an unassertive figure with a face half-obliterated by lifeless, silky hair, continually occupied in “taking care” of his wife, continually harassed by the idea that he didn’t and couldn’t understand her.But Beatrice Blaine! There was a woman! Early pictures taken on her father’s estate at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, or in Rome at the Sacred Heart Convent—an educational extravagance that in her youth was only for the daughters of the exceptionally wealthy—showed the exquisite delicacy of her features, the consummate art and simplicity of her clothes."
15967,8,"A brilliant education she had—her youth passed in renaissance glory, she was versed in the latest gossip of the Older Roman Families; known by name as a fabulously wealthy American girl to Cardinal Vitori and Queen Margherita and more subtle celebrities that one must have had some culture even to have heard of."
15968,8,"She learned in England to prefer whiskey and soda to wine, and her small talk was broadened in two senses during a winter in Vienna."
15969,8,"All in all Beatrice O’Hara absorbed the sort of education that will be quite impossible ever again; a tutelage measured by the number of things and people one could be contemptuous of and charming about; a culture rich in all arts and traditions, barren of all ideas, in the last of those days when the great gardener clipped the inferior roses to produce one perfect bud.In her less important moments she returned to America, met Stephen Blaine and married him—this almost entirely because she was a little bit weary, a little bit sad."
15970,8,Her only child was carried through a tiresome season and brought into the world on a spring day in ninety-six.When Amory was five he was already a delightful companion for her.
15971,8,"He was an auburn-haired boy, with great, handsome eyes which he would grow up to in time, a facile imaginative mind and a taste for fancy dress."
15972,8,"From his fourth to his tenth year he did the country with his mother in her father’s private car, from Coronado, where his mother became so bored that she had a nervous breakdown in a fashionable hotel, down to Mexico City, where she took a mild, almost epidemic consumption."
15973,8,"This trouble pleased her, and later she made use of it as an intrinsic part of her atmosphere—especially after several astounding bracers.So, while more or less fortunate little rich boys were defying governesses on the beach at Newport, or being spanked or tutored or read to from “Do and Dare,” or “Frank on the Mississippi,” Amory was biting acquiescent bell-boys in the Waldorf, outgrowing a natural repugnance to chamber music and symphonies, and deriving a highly specialized education from his mother.“Amory.”“Yes, Beatrice.” (Such a quaint name for his mother; she encouraged it.)“Dear, don’t think of getting out of bed yet."
15974,8,I’ve always suspected that early rising in early life makes one nervous.
15975,8,"Clothilde is having your breakfast brought up.”“All right.”“I am feeling very old today, Amory,” she would sigh, her face a rare cameo of pathos, her voice exquisitely modulated, her hands as facile as Bernhardt’s."
15976,8,“My nerves are on edge—on edge.
15977,8,We must leave this terrifying place tomorrow and go searching for sunshine.”Amory’s penetrating green eyes would look out through tangled hair at his mother.
15978,8,"Even at this age he had no illusions about her.“Amory.”“Oh, yes.”“I want you to take a red-hot bath as hot as you can bear it, and just relax your nerves."
15979,8,"You can read in the tub if you wish.”She fed him sections of the Fêtes Galantes before he was ten; at eleven he could talk glibly, if rather reminiscently, of Brahms and Mozart and Beethoven."
15980,8,"One afternoon, when left alone in the hotel at Hot Springs, he sampled his mother’s apricot cordial, and as the taste pleased him, he became quite tipsy."
15981,8,"This was fun for a while, but he essayed a cigarette in his exaltation, and succumbed to a vulgar, plebeian reaction."
15982,8,"Though this incident horrified Beatrice, it also secretly amused her and became part of what in a later generation would have been termed her “line.”“This son of mine,” he heard her tell a room full of awestruck, admiring women one day, “is entirely sophisticated and quite charming—but delicate—we’re all delicate; here, you know.” Her hand was radiantly outlined against her beautiful bosom; then sinking her voice to a whisper, she told them of the apricot cordial."
15983,8,"They rejoiced, for she was a brave raconteuse, but many were the keys turned in sideboard locks that night against the possible defection of little Bobby or Barbara."

15987,8,"Blaine when available, and very often a physician."
15988,8,"When Amory had the whooping cough four disgusted specialists glared at each other hunched around his bed; when he took scarlet fever the number of attendants, including physicians and nurses, totalled fourteen."
15989,8,"However, blood being thicker than broth, he was pulled through.The Blaines were attached to no city."
15990,8,"They were the Blaines of Lake Geneva; they had quite enough relatives to serve in place of friends, and an enviable standing from Pasadena to Cape Cod."
15991,8,"But Beatrice grew more and more prone to like only new acquaintances, as there were certain stories, such as the history of her constitution and its many amendments, memories of her years abroad, that it was necessary for her to repeat at regular intervals."
15992,8,"Like Freudian dreams, they must be thrown off, else they would sweep in and lay siege to her nerves."
15993,8,"But Beatrice was critical about American women, especially the floating population of ex-Westerners.“They have accents, my dear,” she told Amory, “not Southern accents or Boston accents, not an accent attached to any locality, just an accent”—she became dreamy."
15994,8,"“They pick up old, moth-eaten London accents that are down on their luck and have to be used by someone."
15995,8,"They talk as an English butler might after several years in a Chicago grand-opera company.” She became almost incoherent—“Suppose—time in every Western woman’s life—she feels her husband is prosperous enough for her to have—accent—they try to impress me, my dear—”Though she thought of her body as a mass of frailties, she considered her soul quite as ill, and therefore important in her life."
15996,8,"She had once been a Catholic, but discovering that priests were infinitely more attentive when she was in process of losing or regaining faith in Mother Church, she maintained an enchantingly wavering attitude."
15997,8,"Often she deplored the bourgeois quality of the American Catholic clergy, and was quite sure that had she lived in the shadow of the great Continental cathedrals her soul would still be a thin flame on the mighty altar of Rome."
15998,8,"Still, next to doctors, priests were her favorite sport.“Ah, Bishop Wiston,” she would declare, “I do not want to talk of myself."
15999,8,"I can imagine the stream of hysterical women fluttering at your doors, beseeching you to be simpatico”—then after an interlude filled by the clergyman—“but my mood—is—oddly dissimilar.”Only to bishops and above did she divulge her clerical romance."
16000,8,"When she had first returned to her country there had been a pagan, Swinburnian young man in Asheville, for whose passionate kisses and unsentimental conversations she had taken a decided penchant—they had discussed the matter pro and con with an intellectual romancing quite devoid of sappiness."
16001,8,"Eventually she had decided to marry for background, and the young pagan from Asheville had gone through a spiritual crisis, joined the Catholic Church, and was now—Monsignor Darcy.“Indeed, Mrs."
16002,8,"Blaine, he is still delightful company—quite the cardinal’s right-hand man.”“Amory will go to him one day, I know,” breathed the beautiful lady, “and Monsignor Darcy will understand him as he understood me.”Amory became thirteen, rather tall and slender, and more than ever on to his Celtic mother."
16003,8,"He had tutored occasionally—the idea being that he was to “keep up,” at each place “taking up the work where he left off,” yet as no tutor ever found the place he left off, his mind was still in very good shape."
16004,8,What a few more years of this life would have made of him is problematical.
16005,8,"However, four hours out from land, Italy bound, with Beatrice, his appendix burst, probably from too many meals in bed, and after a series of frantic telegrams to Europe and America, to the amazement of the passengers the great ship slowly wheeled around and returned to New York to deposit Amory at the pier."
16006,8,"You will admit that if it was not life it was magnificent.After the operation Beatrice had a nervous breakdown that bore a suspicious resemblance to delirium tremens, and Amory was left in Minneapolis, destined to spend the ensuing two years with his aunt and uncle."
16007,8,"There the crude, vulgar air of Western civilization first catches him—in his underwear, so to speak.A KISS FOR AMORYHis lip curled when he read it.I am going to have a bobbing party [it said] on Thursday, December the seventeenth, at five o’clock, and I would like it very much if you could come.Yours truly,R.S.V.P."
16008,8,Myra St.
16009,8,"ClaireHe had been two months in Minneapolis, and his chief struggle had been the concealing from “the other guys at school” how particularly superior he felt himself to be, yet this conviction was built upon shifting sands."
16010,8,He had shown off one day in French class (he was in senior French class) to the utter confusion of Mr.
16011,8,"Reardon, whose accent Amory damned contemptuously, and to the delight of the class."
16012,8,Mr.
16013,8,"Reardon, who had spent several weeks in Paris ten years before, took his revenge on the verbs, whenever he had his book open."
16014,8,"But another time Amory showed off in history class, with quite disastrous results, for the boys there were his own age, and they shrilled innuendoes at each other all the following week:“Aw—I b’lieve, doncherknow, the Umuricun revolution was lawgely an affair of the middul clawses,” or“Washington came of very good blood—aw, quite good—I b’lieve.”Amory ingeniously tried to retrieve himself by blundering on purpose."
16015,8,"Two years before he had commenced a history of the United States which, though it only got as far as the Colonial Wars, had been pronounced by his mother completely enchanting.His chief disadvantage lay in athletics, but as soon as he discovered that it was the touchstone of power and popularity at school, he began to make furious, persistent efforts to excel in the winter sports, and with his ankles aching and bending in spite of his efforts, he skated valiantly around the Lorelie rink every afternoon, wondering how soon he would be able to carry a hockey stick without getting it inexplicably tangled in his skates.The invitation to Miss Myra St."
16016,8,"Claire’s bobbing party spent the morning in his coat pocket, where it had an intense physical affair with a dusty piece of peanut brittle."
16017,8,"During the afternoon he brought it to light with a sigh, and after some consideration and a preliminary draft in the back of Collar and Daniel’s First-Year Latin, composed an answer:My dear Miss St."
16018,8,Claire:Your truly charming envitation for the evening of next Thursday evening was truly delightful to receive this morning.
16019,8,I will be charm and inchanted indeed to present my compliments on next Thursday evening.
16020,8,"Faithfully,Amory BlaineOn Thursday, therefore, he walked pensively along the slippery, shovel-scraped sidewalks, and came in sight of Myra’s house, on the half-hour after five, a lateness which he fancied his mother would have favored."
16021,8,"He waited on the doorstep with his eyes nonchalantly half-closed, and planned his entrance with precision."
16022,8,"He would cross the floor, not too hastily, to Mrs."
16023,8,St.
16024,8,"Claire, and say with exactly the correct modulation:“My dear Mrs."
16025,8,St.
16026,8,"Claire, I’m frightfully sorry to be late, but my maid”—he paused there and realized he would be quoting—“but my uncle and I had to see a fella—Yes, I’ve met your enchanting daughter at dancing school.”Then he would shake hands, using that slight, half-foreign bow, with all the starchy little females, and nod to the fellas who would be standing ’round, paralyzed into rigid groups for mutual protection.A butler (one of the three in Minneapolis) swung open the door."
16027,8,Amory stepped inside and divested himself of cap and coat.
16028,8,"He was mildly surprised not to hear the shrill squawk of conversation from the next room, and he decided it must be quite formal."
16029,8,"He approved of that—as he approved of the butler.“Miss Myra,” he said.To his surprise the butler grinned horribly.“Oh, yeah,” he declared, “she’s here.” He was unaware that his failure to be cockney was ruining his standing."
16030,8,"Amory considered him coldly.“But,” continued the butler, his voice rising unnecessarily, “she’s the only one what is here."
16031,8,The party’s gone.”Amory gasped in sudden horror.“What?”“She’s been waitin’ for Amory Blaine.
16032,8,"That’s you, ain’t it? Her mother says that if you showed up by five-thirty you two was to go after ’em in the Packard.”Amory’s despair was crystallized by the appearance of Myra herself, bundled to the ears in a polo coat, her face plainly sulky, her voice pleasant only with difficulty.“‘Lo, Amory.”“‘Lo, Myra.” He had described the state of his vitality.“Well—you got here, anyways.”“Well—I’ll tell you."
16033,8,"I guess you don’t know about the auto accident,” he romanced.Myra’s eyes opened wide.“Who was it to?”“Well,” he continued desperately, “uncle’n aunt’n I.”“Was any one killed?”Amory paused and then nodded.“Your uncle?”—alarm.“Oh, no just a horse—a sorta gray horse.”At this point the Erse butler snickered.“Probably killed the engine,” he suggested."
16034,8,"Amory would have put him on the rack without a scruple.“We’ll go now,” said Myra coolly."
16035,8,"“You see, Amory, the bobs were ordered for five and everybody was here, so we couldn’t wait—”“Well, I couldn’t help it, could I?”“So mama said for me to wait till ha’past five."
16036,8,"We’ll catch the bobs before it gets to the Minnehaha Club, Amory.”Amory’s shredded poise dropped from him."
16037,8,"He pictured the happy party jingling along snowy streets, the appearance of the limousine, the horrible public descent of him and Myra before sixty reproachful eyes, his apology—a real one this time."
16038,8,He sighed aloud.“What?” inquired Myra.“Nothing.
16039,8,I was just yawning.
16040,8,"Are we going to surely catch up with ’em before they get there?” He was encouraging a faint hope that they might slip into the Minnehaha Club and meet the others there, be found in blasé seclusion before the fire and quite regain his lost attitude.“Oh, sure Mike, we’ll catch ’em all right—let’s hurry.”He became conscious of his stomach."
16041,8,As they stepped into the machine he hurriedly slapped the paint of diplomacy over a rather box-like plan he had conceived.
16042,8,"It was based upon some “trade-lasts” gleaned at dancing school, to the effect that he was “awful good-looking and English, sort of.”“Myra,” he said, lowering his voice and choosing his words carefully, “I beg a thousand pardons."
16043,8,"Can you ever forgive me?” She regarded him gravely, his intent green eyes, his mouth, that to her thirteen-year-old, arrow-collar taste was the quintessence of romance."
16044,8,"Yes, Myra could forgive him very easily.“Why—yes—sure.”He looked at her again, and then dropped his eyes."
16045,8,"He had lashes.“I’m awful,” he said sadly."
16046,8,“I’m diff’runt.
16047,8,I don’t know why I make faux pas.
16048,8,"’Cause I don’t care, I s’pose.” Then, recklessly: “I been smoking too much."
16049,8,"I’ve got t’bacca heart.”Myra pictured an all-night tobacco debauch, with Amory pale and reeling from the effect of nicotined lungs."
16050,8,"She gave a little gasp.“Oh, Amory, don’t smoke."
16051,8,"You’ll stunt your growth!”“I don’t care,” he persisted gloomily."
16052,8,“I gotta.
16053,8,I got the habit.
16054,8,"I’ve done a lot of things that if my fambly knew”—he hesitated, giving her imagination time to picture dark horrors—“I went to the burlesque show last week.”Myra was quite overcome."
16055,8,He turned the green eyes on her again.
16056,8,"“You’re the only girl in town I like much,” he exclaimed in a rush of sentiment."
16057,8,"“You’re simpatico.”Myra was not sure that she was, but it sounded stylish though vaguely improper.Thick dusk had descended outside, and as the limousine made a sudden turn she was jolted against him; their hands touched.“You shouldn’t smoke, Amory,” she whispered."
16058,8,"“Don’t you know that?”He shook his head.“Nobody cares.”Myra hesitated.“I care.”Something stirred within Amory.“Oh, yes, you do! You got a crush on Froggy Parker."
16059,8,"I guess everybody knows that.”“No, I haven’t,” very slowly.A silence, while Amory thrilled."
16060,8,"There was something fascinating about Myra, shut away here cosily from the dim, chill air."
16061,8,"Myra, a little bundle of clothes, with strands of yellow hair curling out from under her skating cap.“Because I’ve got a crush, too—” He paused, for he heard in the distance the sound of young laughter, and, peering through the frosted glass along the lamp-lit street, he made out the dark outline of the bobbing party."
16062,8,He must act quickly.
16063,8,"He reached over with a violent, jerky effort, and clutched Myra’s hand—her thumb, to be exact.“Tell him to go to the Minnehaha straight,” he whispered."
16064,8,"“I wanta talk to you—I got to talk to you.”Myra made out the party ahead, had an instant vision of her mother, and then—alas for convention—glanced into the eyes beside."
16065,8,"“Turn down this side street, Richard, and drive straight to the Minnehaha Club!” she cried through the speaking tube."
16066,8,"Amory sank back against the cushions with a sigh of relief.“I can kiss her,” he thought."
16067,8,“I’ll bet I can.
16068,8,"I’ll bet I can!”Overhead the sky was half crystalline, half misty, and the night around was chill and vibrant with rich tension."
16069,8,"From the Country Club steps the roads stretched away, dark creases on the white blanket; huge heaps of snow lining the sides like the tracks of giant moles."
16070,8,"They lingered for a moment on the steps, and watched the white holiday moon.“Pale moons like that one”—Amory made a vague gesture—“make people mystérieuse."
16071,8,"You look like a young witch with her cap off and her hair sorta mussed”—her hands clutched at her hair—“Oh, leave it, it looks good.”They drifted up the stairs and Myra led the way into the little den of his dreams, where a cosy fire was burning before a big sink-down couch."
16072,8,"A few years later this was to be a great stage for Amory, a cradle for many an emotional crisis."
16073,8,"Now they talked for a moment about bobbing parties.“There’s always a bunch of shy fellas,” he commented, “sitting at the tail of the bob, sorta lurkin’ an’ whisperin’ an’ pushin’ each other off."
16074,8,"Then there’s always some crazy cross-eyed girl”—he gave a terrifying imitation—“she’s always talkin’ hard, sorta, to the chaperon.”“You’re such a funny boy,” puzzled Myra.“How d’y’ mean?” Amory gave immediate attention, on his own ground at last.“Oh—always talking about crazy things."
16075,8,"Why don’t you come skiing with Marylyn and I tomorrow?”“I don’t like girls in the daytime,” he said shortly, and then, thinking this a bit abrupt, he added: “But I like you.” He cleared his throat."
16076,8,“I like you first and second and third.”Myra’s eyes became dreamy.
16077,8,What a story this would make to tell Marylyn! Here on the couch with this wonderful-looking boy—the little fire—the sense that they were alone in the great building—Myra capitulated.
16078,8,"The atmosphere was too appropriate.“I like you the first twenty-five,” she confessed, her voice trembling, “and Froggy Parker twenty-sixth.”Froggy had fallen twenty-five places in one hour."
16079,8,"As yet he had not even noticed it.But Amory, being on the spot, leaned over quickly and kissed Myra’s cheek."
16080,8,"He had never kissed a girl before, and he tasted his lips curiously, as if he had munched some new fruit."
16081,8,"Then their lips brushed like young wild flowers in the wind.“We’re awful,” rejoiced Myra gently."
16082,8,"She slipped her hand into his, her head drooped against his shoulder."
16083,8,"Sudden revulsion seized Amory, disgust, loathing for the whole incident."
16084,8,"He desired frantically to be away, never to see Myra again, never to kiss any one; he became conscious of his face and hers, of their clinging hands, and he wanted to creep out of his body and hide somewhere safe out of sight, up in the corner of his mind.“Kiss me again.” Her voice came out of a great void.“I don’t want to,” he heard himself saying."
16085,8,"There was another pause.“I don’t want to!” he repeated passionately.Myra sprang up, her cheeks pink with bruised vanity, the great bow on the back of her head trembling sympathetically.“I hate you!” she cried."
16086,8,"“Don’t you ever dare to speak to me again!”“What?” stammered Amory.“I’ll tell mama you kissed me! I will too! I will too! I’ll tell mama, and she won’t let me play with you!”Amory rose and stared at her helplessly, as though she were a new animal of whose presence on the earth he had not heretofore been aware.The door opened suddenly, and Myra’s mother appeared on the threshold, fumbling with her lorgnette.“Well,” she began, adjusting it benignantly, “the man at the desk told me you two children were up here—How do you do, Amory.”Amory watched Myra and waited for the crash—but none came."
16087,8,"The pout faded, the high pink subsided, and Myra’s voice was placid as a summer lake when she answered her mother.“Oh, we started so late, mama, that I thought we might as well—”He heard from below the shrieks of laughter, and smelled the vapid odor of hot chocolate and tea cakes as he silently followed mother and daughter downstairs."
16088,8,"The sound of the graphophone mingled with the voices of many girls humming the air, and a faint glow was born and spread over him:Casey-Jones—mounted to the cab-unCasey-Jones—’th his orders in his hand.Casey-Jones—mounted to the cab-unTook his farewell journey to the prom-ised land.SNAPSHOTS OF THE YOUNG EGOTISTAmory spent nearly two years in Minneapolis."
16089,8,"The first winter he wore moccasins that were born yellow, but after many applications of oil and dirt assumed their mature color, a dirty, greenish brown; he wore a gray plaid mackinaw coat, and a red toboggan cap."
16090,8,"His dog, Count Del Monte, ate the red cap, so his uncle gave him a gray one that pulled down over his face."
16091,8,The trouble with this one was that you breathed into it and your breath froze; one day the darn thing froze his cheek.
16092,8,"He rubbed snow on his cheek, but it turned bluish-black just the same.The Count Del Monte ate a box of bluing once, but it didn’t hurt him."
16093,8,"Later, however, he lost his mind and ran madly up the street, bumping into fences, rolling in gutters, and pursuing his eccentric course out of Amory’s life."
16094,8,"Amory cried on his bed.“Poor little Count,” he cried."
16095,8,"“Oh, poor little Count!”After several months he suspected Count of a fine piece of emotional acting."
16096,8,***Amory and Frog Parker considered that the greatest line in literature occurred in Act III of Arsene Lupin.They sat in the first row at the Wednesday and Saturday matinees.
16097,8,"The line was:“If one can’t be a great artist or a great soldier, the next best thing is to be a great criminal.”Amory fell in love again, and wrote a poem."
16098,8,"This was it:Marylyn and Sallee,Those are the girls for me.Marylyn stands aboveSallee in that sweet, deep love.He was interested in whether McGovern of Minnesota would make the first or second All-American, how to do the card-pass, how to do the coin-pass, chameleon ties, how babies were born, and whether Three-fingered Brown was really a better pitcher than Christie Mathewson.Among other things he read: For the Honor of the School, Little Women (twice), The Common Law, Sapho, Dangerous Dan McGrew, The Broad Highway (three times), The Fall of the House of Usher, Three Weeks, Mary Ware, the Little Colonel’s Chum, Gunga Din, the Police Gazette, and Jim-Jam Jems.He had all the Henty biases in history, and was particularly fond of the cheerful murder stories of Mary Roberts Rinehart.School ruined his French and gave him a distaste for standard authors."
16099,8,"His masters considered him idle, unreliable and superficially clever.He collected locks of hair from many girls."
16100,8,He wore the rings of several.
16101,8,"Finally he could borrow no more rings, owing to his nervous habit of chewing them out of shape."
16102,8,"This, it seemed, usually aroused the jealous suspicions of the next borrower.All through the summer months Amory and Frog Parker went each week to the Stock Company."
16103,8,"Afterward they would stroll home in the balmy air of August night, dreaming along Hennepin and Nicollet Avenues, through the gay crowd."
16104,8,"Amory wondered how people could fail to notice that he was a boy marked for glory, and when faces of the throng turned toward him and ambiguous eyes stared into his, he assumed the most romantic of expressions and walked on the air cushions that lie on the asphalts of fourteen.Always, after he was in bed, there were voices—indefinite, fading, enchanting—just outside his window, and before he fell asleep he would dream one of his favorite waking dreams, the one about becoming a great half-back, or the one about the Japanese invasion, when he was rewarded by being made the youngest general in the world."
16105,8,"It was always the becoming he dreamed of, never the being."
16106,8,"This, too, was quite characteristic of Amory.CODE OF THE YOUNG EGOTISTBefore he was summoned back to Lake Geneva, he had appeared, shy but inwardly glowing, in his first long trousers, set off by a purple accordion tie and a “Belmont” collar with the edges unassailably meeting, purple socks, and handkerchief with a purple border peeping from his breast pocket."
16107,8,"But more than that, he had formulated his first philosophy, a code to live by, which, as near as it can be named, was a sort of aristocratic egotism.He had realized that his best interests were bound up with those of a certain variant, changing person, whose label, in order that his past might always be identified with him, was Amory Blaine."
16108,8,"Amory marked himself a fortunate youth, capable of infinite expansion for good or evil."
16109,8,"He did not consider himself a “strong char’c’ter,” but relied on his facility (learn things sorta quick) and his superior mentality (read a lotta deep books)."
16110,8,He was proud of the fact that he could never become a mechanical or scientific genius.
16111,8,From no other heights was he debarred.Physically.—Amory thought that he was exceedingly handsome.
16112,8,He was.
16113,8,"He fancied himself an athlete of possibilities and a supple dancer.Socially.—Here his condition was, perhaps, most dangerous."
16114,8,"He granted himself personality, charm, magnetism, poise, the power of dominating all contemporary males, the gift of fascinating all women.Mentally.—Complete, unquestioned superiority.Now a confession will have to be made."
16115,8,Amory had rather a Puritan conscience.
16116,8,Not that he yielded to it—later in life he almost completely slew it—but at fifteen it made him consider himself a great deal worse than other boys .

16138,8,.
16139,8,.
16140,8,"he was a slave to his own moods and he felt that though he was capable of recklessness and audacity, he possessed neither courage, perseverance, nor self-respect.Vanity, tempered with self-suspicion if not self-knowledge, a sense of people as automatons to his will, a desire to “pass” as many boys as possible and get to a vague top of the world ."
16141,8,.
16142,8,.
16143,8,"with this background did Amory drift into adolescence.PREPARATORY TO THE GREAT ADVENTUREThe train slowed up with midsummer languor at Lake Geneva, and Amory caught sight of his mother waiting in her electric on the gravelled station drive."
16144,8,"It was an ancient electric, one of the early types, and painted gray."
16145,8,"The sight of her sitting there, slenderly erect, and of her face, where beauty and dignity combined, melting to a dreamy recollected smile, filled him with a sudden great pride of her."
16146,8,"As they kissed coolly and he stepped into the electric, he felt a quick fear lest he had lost the requisite charm to measure up to her.“Dear boy—you’re so tall ."

16151,8,".”She looked left and right, she slipped cautiously into a speed of two miles an hour, beseeching Amory to act as sentinel; and at one busy crossing she made him get out and run ahead to signal her forward like a traffic policeman."
16152,8,"Beatrice was what might be termed a careful driver.“You are tall—but you’re still very handsome—you’ve skipped the awkward age, or is that sixteen; perhaps it’s fourteen or fifteen; I can never remember; but you’ve skipped it.”“Don’t embarrass me,” murmured Amory.“But, my dear boy, what odd clothes! They look as if they were a set—don’t they? Is your underwear purple, too?”Amory grunted impolitely.“You must go to Brooks’ and get some really nice suits."
16153,8,"Oh, we’ll have a talk tonight or perhaps tomorrow night."
16154,8,I want to tell you about your heart—you’ve probably been neglecting your heart—and you don’t know.”Amory thought how superficial was the recent overlay of his own generation.
16155,8,"Aside from a minute shyness, he felt that the old cynical kinship with his mother had not been one bit broken."
16156,8,"Yet for the first few days he wandered about the gardens and along the shore in a state of superloneliness, finding a lethargic content in smoking “Bull” at the garage with one of the chauffeurs.The sixty acres of the estate were dotted with old and new summer houses and many fountains and white benches that came suddenly into sight from foliage-hung hiding-places; there was a great and constantly increasing family of white cats that prowled the many flowerbeds and were silhouetted suddenly at night against the darkening trees."
16157,8,"It was on one of the shadowy paths that Beatrice at last captured Amory, after Mr."
16158,8,"Blaine had, as usual, retired for the evening to his private library."
16159,8,"After reproving him for avoiding her, she took him for a long tête-à-tête in the moonlight."
16160,8,"He could not reconcile himself to her beauty, that was mother to his own, the exquisite neck and shoulders, the grace of a fortunate woman of thirty.“Amory, dear,” she crooned softly, “I had such a strange, weird time after I left you.”“Did you, Beatrice?”“When I had my last breakdown”—she spoke of it as a sturdy, gallant feat.“The doctors told me”—her voice sang on a confidential note—“that if any man alive had done the consistent drinking that I have, he would have been physically shattered, my dear, and in his grave—long in his grave.”Amory winced, and wondered how this would have sounded to Froggy Parker.“Yes,” continued Beatrice tragically, “I had dreams—wonderful visions.” She pressed the palms of her hands into her eyes."
16161,8,"“I saw bronze rivers lapping marble shores, and great birds that soared through the air, parti-colored birds with iridescent plumage."
16162,8,"I heard strange music and the flare of barbaric trumpets—what?”Amory had snickered.“What, Amory?”“I said go on, Beatrice.”“That was all—it merely recurred and recurred—gardens that flaunted coloring against which this would be quite dull, moons that whirled and swayed, paler than winter moons, more golden than harvest moons—”“Are you quite well now, Beatrice?”“Quite well—as well as I will ever be."
16163,8,"I am not understood, Amory."
16164,8,"I know that can’t express it to you, Amory, but—I am not understood.”Amory was quite moved."
16165,8,"He put his arm around his mother, rubbing his head gently against her shoulder.“Poor Beatrice—poor Beatrice.”“Tell me about you, Amory."
16166,8,"Did you have two horrible years?”Amory considered lying, and then decided against it.“No, Beatrice."
16167,8,I enjoyed them.
16168,8,I adapted myself to the bourgeoisie.
16169,8,"I became conventional.” He surprised himself by saying that, and he pictured how Froggy would have gaped.“Beatrice,” he said suddenly, “I want to go away to school."
16170,8,"Everybody in Minneapolis is going to go away to school.”Beatrice showed some alarm.“But you’re only fifteen.”“Yes, but everybody goes away to school at fifteen, and I want to, Beatrice.”On Beatrice’s suggestion the subject was dropped for the rest of the walk, but a week later she delighted him by saying:“Amory, I have decided to let you have your way."
16171,8,"If you still want to, you can go to school.”“Yes?”“To St."
16172,8,"Regis’s in Connecticut.”Amory felt a quick excitement.“It’s being arranged,” continued Beatrice."
16173,8,“It’s better that you should go away.
16174,8,"I’d have preferred you to have gone to Eton, and then to Christ Church, Oxford, but it seems impracticable now—and for the present we’ll let the university question take care of itself.”“What are you going to do, Beatrice?”“Heaven knows."
16175,8,It seems my fate to fret away my years in this country.
16176,8,"Not for a second do I regret being American—indeed, I think that a regret typical of very vulgar people, and I feel sure we are the great coming nation—yet”—and she sighed—“I feel my life should have drowsed away close to an older, mellower civilization, a land of greens and autumnal browns—”Amory did not answer, so his mother continued:“My regret is that you haven’t been abroad, but still, as you are a man, it’s better that you should grow up here under the snarling eagle—is that the right term?”Amory agreed that it was."
16177,8,She would not have appreciated the Japanese invasion.“When do I go to school?”“Next month.
16178,8,You’ll have to start East a little early to take your examinations.
16179,8,"After that you’ll have a free week, so I want you to go up the Hudson and pay a visit.”“To who?”“To Monsignor Darcy, Amory."
16180,8,He wants to see you.
16181,8,He went to Harrow and then to Yale—became a Catholic.
16182,8,I want him to talk to you—I feel he can be such a help—” She stroked his auburn hair gently.
16183,8,"“Dear Amory, dear Amory—”“Dear Beatrice—”So early in September Amory, provided with “six suits summer underwear, six suits winter underwear, one sweater or t-shirt, one jersey, one overcoat, winter, etc.,” set out for New England, the land of schools.There were Andover and Exeter with their memories of New England dead—large, college-like democracies; St."

16187,8,"George’s, prosperous and well-dressed; Taft and Hotchkiss, which prepared the wealth of the Middle West for social success at Yale; Pawling, Westminster, Choate, Kent, and a hundred others; all milling out their well-set-up, conventional, impressive type, year after year; their mental stimulus the college entrance exams; their vague purpose set forth in a hundred circulars as “To impart a Thorough Mental, Moral, and Physical Training as a Christian Gentleman, to fit the boy for meeting the problems of his day and generation, and to give a solid foundation in the Arts and Sciences.”At St."
16188,8,"Regis’s Amory stayed three days and took his exams with a scoffing confidence, then doubling back to New York to pay his tutelary visit."
16189,8,"The metropolis, barely glimpsed, made little impression on him, except for the sense of cleanliness he drew from the tall white buildings seen from a Hudson River steamboat in the early morning."
16190,8,"Indeed, his mind was so crowded with dreams of athletic prowess at school that he considered this visit only as a rather tiresome prelude to the great adventure."
16191,8,"This, however, it did not prove to be.Monsignor Darcy’s house was an ancient, rambling structure set on a hill overlooking the river, and there lived its owner, between his trips to all parts of the Roman Catholic world, rather like an exiled Stuart king waiting to be called to the rule of his land."
16192,8,"Monsignor was forty-four then, and bustling—a trifle too stout for symmetry, with hair the color of spun gold, and a brilliant, enveloping personality."
16193,8,"When he came into a room clad in his full purple regalia from thatch to toe, he resembled a Turner sunset, and attracted both admiration and attention."
16194,8,"He had written two novels: one of them violently anti-Catholic, just before his conversion, and five years later another, in which he had attempted to turn all his clever jibes against Catholics into even cleverer innuendoes against Episcopalians."
16195,8,"He was intensely ritualistic, startlingly dramatic, loved the idea of God enough to be a celibate, and rather liked his neighbor.Children adored him because he was like a child; youth revelled in his company because he was still a youth, and couldn’t be shocked."
16196,8,"In the proper land and century he might have been a Richelieu—at present he was a very moral, very religious (if not particularly pious) clergyman, making a great mystery about pulling rusty wires, and appreciating life to the fullest, if not entirely enjoying it.He and Amory took to each other at first sight—the jovial, impressive prelate who could dazzle an embassy ball, and the green-eyed, intent youth, in his first long trousers, accepted in their own minds a relation of father and son within a half-hour’s conversation.“My dear boy, I’ve been waiting to see you for years."
16197,8,Take a big chair and we’ll have a chat.”“I’ve just come from school—St.
16198,8,"Regis’s, you know.”“So your mother says—a remarkable woman; have a cigarette—I’m sure you smoke."
16199,8,"Well, if you’re like me, you loathe all science and mathematics—”Amory nodded vehemently.“Hate ’em all."
16200,8,Like English and history.”“Of course.
16201,8,"You’ll hate school for a while, too, but I’m glad you’re going to St."
16202,8,"Regis’s.”“Why?”“Because it’s a gentleman’s school, and democracy won’t hit you so early."
16203,8,"You’ll find plenty of that in college.”“I want to go to Princeton,” said Amory."
16204,8,"“I don’t know why, but I think of all Harvard men as sissies, like I used to be, and all Yale men as wearing big blue sweaters and smoking pipes.”Monsignor chuckled.“I’m one, you know.”“Oh, you’re different—I think of Princeton as being lazy and good-looking and aristocratic—you know, like a spring day."
16205,8,"Harvard seems sort of indoors—”“And Yale is November, crisp and energetic,” finished Monsignor.“That’s it.”They slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered.“I was for Bonnie Prince Charlie,” announced Amory.“Of course you were—and for Hannibal—”“Yes, and for the Southern Confederacy.” He was rather sceptical about being an Irish patriot—he suspected that being Irish was being somewhat common—but Monsignor assured him that Ireland was a romantic lost cause and Irish people quite charming, and that it should, by all means, be one of his principal biases.After a crowded hour which included several more cigarettes, and during which Monsignor learned, to his surprise but not to his horror, that Amory had not been brought up a Catholic, he announced that he had another guest."
16206,8,"This turned out to be the Honorable Thornton Hancock, of Boston, ex-minister to The Hague, author of an erudite history of the Middle Ages and the last of a distinguished, patriotic, and brilliant family.“He comes here for a rest,” said Monsignor confidentially, treating Amory as a contemporary."
16207,8,"“I act as an escape from the weariness of agnosticism, and I think I’m the only man who knows how his staid old mind is really at sea and longs for a sturdy spar like the Church to cling to.”Their first luncheon was one of the memorable events of Amory’s early life."
16208,8,He was quite radiant and gave off a peculiar brightness and charm.
16209,8,"Monsignor called out the best that he had thought by question and suggestion, and Amory talked with an ingenious brilliance of a thousand impulses and desires and repulsions and faiths and fears."
16210,8,"He and Monsignor held the floor, and the older man, with his less receptive, less accepting, yet certainly not colder mentality, seemed content to listen and bask in the mellow sunshine that played between these two."
16211,8,"Monsignor gave the effect of sunlight to many people; Amory gave it in his youth and, to some extent, when he was very much older, but never again was it quite so mutually spontaneous.“He’s a radiant boy,” thought Thornton Hancock, who had seen the splendor of two continents and talked with Parnell and Gladstone and Bismarck—and afterward he added to Monsignor: “But his education ought not to be entrusted to a school or college.”But for the next four years the best of Amory’s intellect was concentrated on matters of popularity, the intricacies of a university social system and American Society as represented by Biltmore Teas and Hot Springs golf links.."

16213,8,.
16214,8,"In all, a wonderful week, that saw Amory’s mind turned inside out, a hundred of his theories confirmed, and his joy of life crystallized to a thousand ambitions."
16215,8,"Not that the conversation was scholastic—heaven forbid! Amory had only the vaguest idea as to what Bernard Shaw was—but Monsignor made quite as much out of The Beloved Vagabond and Sir Nigel, taking good care that Amory never once felt out of his depth.But the trumpets were sounding for Amory’s preliminary skirmish with his own generation.“You’re not sorry to go, of course."
16216,8,"With people like us our home is where we are not,” said Monsignor.“I am sorry—”“No, you’re not."

16218,8,"Regis’s, though in turn painful and triumphant, had as little real significance in his own life as the American “prep” school, crushed as it is under the heel of the universities, has to American life in general."
16219,8,"We have no Eton to create the self-consciousness of a governing class; we have, instead, clean, flaccid and innocuous preparatory schools.He went all wrong at the start, was generally considered both conceited and arrogant, and universally detested."
16220,8,"He played football intensely, alternating a reckless brilliancy with a tendency to keep himself as safe from hazard as decency would permit."
16221,8,"In a wild panic he backed out of a fight with a boy his own size, to a chorus of scorn, and a week later, in desperation, picked a battle with another boy very much bigger, from which he emerged badly beaten, but rather proud of himself.He was resentful against all those in authority over him, and this, combined with a lazy indifference toward his work, exasperated every master in school."
16222,8,He grew discouraged and imagined himself a pariah; took to sulking in corners and reading after lights.
16223,8,"With a dread of being alone he attached a few friends, but since they were not among the elite of the school, he used them simply as mirrors of himself, audiences before which he might do that posing absolutely essential to him."
16224,8,"He was unbearably lonely, desperately unhappy.There were some few grains of comfort."
16225,8,"Whenever Amory was submerged, his vanity was the last part to go below the surface, so he could still enjoy a comfortable glow when “Wookey-wookey,” the deaf old housekeeper, told him that he was the best-looking boy she had ever seen."
16226,8,"It had pleased him to be the lightest and youngest man on the first football squad; it pleased him when Doctor Dougall told him at the end of a heated conference that he could, if he wished, get the best marks in school."
16227,8,But Doctor Dougall was wrong.
16228,8,"It was temperamentally impossible for Amory to get the best marks in school.Miserable, confined to bounds, unpopular with both faculty and students—that was Amory’s first term."
16229,8,"But at Christmas he had returned to Minneapolis, tight-lipped and strangely jubilant.“Oh, I was sort of fresh at first,” he told Frog Parker patronizingly, “but I got along fine—lightest man on the squad."
16230,8,"You ought to go away to school, Froggy."
16231,8,"It’s great stuff.”INCIDENT OF THE WELL-MEANING PROFESSOROn the last night of his first term, Mr."
16232,8,"Margotson, the senior master, sent word to study hall that Amory was to come to his room at nine."
16233,8,"Amory suspected that advice was forthcoming, but he determined to be courteous, because this Mr."
16234,8,"Margotson had been kindly disposed toward him.His summoner received him gravely, and motioned him to a chair."
16235,8,"He hemmed several times and looked consciously kind, as a man will when he knows he’s on delicate ground.“Amory,” he began."
16236,8,"“I’ve sent for you on a personal matter.”“Yes, sir.”“I’ve noticed you this year and I—I like you."
16237,8,"I think you have in you the makings of a—a very good man.”“Yes, sir,” Amory managed to articulate."
16238,8,"He hated having people talk as if he were an admitted failure.“But I’ve noticed,” continued the older man blindly, “that you’re not very popular with the boys.”“No, sir.” Amory licked his lips.“Ah—I thought you might not understand exactly what it was they—ah—objected to."
16239,8,"I’m going to tell you, because I believe—ah—that when a boy knows his difficulties he’s better able to cope with them—to conform to what others expect of him.” He a-hemmed again with delicate reticence, and continued: “They seem to think that you’re—ah—rather too fresh—”Amory could stand no more."
16240,8,"He rose from his chair, scarcely controlling his voice when he spoke.“I know—oh, don’t you s’pose I know.” His voice rose."
16241,8,“I know what they think; do you s’pose you have to tell me!” He paused.
16242,8,“I’m—I’ve got to go back now—hope I’m not rude—”He left the room hurriedly.
16243,8,"In the cool air outside, as he walked to his house, he exulted in his refusal to be helped.“That damn old fool!” he cried wildly."
16244,8,"“As if I didn’t know!”He decided, however, that this was a good excuse not to go back to study hall that night, so, comfortably couched up in his room, he munched Nabiscos and finished The White Company.INCIDENT OF THE WONDERFUL GIRLThere was a bright star in February."
16245,8,New York burst upon him on Washington’s Birthday with the brilliance of a long-anticipated event.
16246,8,"His glimpse of it as a vivid whiteness against a deep-blue sky had left a picture of splendor that rivalled the dream cities in the Arabian Nights; but this time he saw it by electric light, and romance gleamed from the chariot-race sign on Broadway and from the women’s eyes at the Astor, where he and young Paskert from St."
16247,8,Regis’s had dinner.
16248,8,"When they walked down the aisle of the theatre, greeted by the nervous twanging and discord of untuned violins and the sensuous, heavy fragrance of paint and powder, he moved in a sphere of epicurean delight."
16249,8,Everything enchanted him.
16250,8,"The play was The Little Millionaire, with George M."
16251,8,"Cohan, and there was one stunning young brunette who made him sit with brimming eyes in the ecstasy of watching her dance.“Oh—you—wonderful girl,What a wonderful girl you are—”sang the tenor, and Amory agreed silently, but passionately.“All—your—wonderful wordsThrill me through—”The violins swelled and quavered on the last notes, the girl sank to a crumpled butterfly on the stage, a great burst of clapping filled the house."
16252,8,"Oh, to fall in love like that, to the languorous magic melody of such a tune!The last scene was laid on a roof garden, and the cellos sighed to the musical moon, while light adventure and facile froth-like comedy flitted back and forth in the calcium."
16253,8,"Amory was on fire to be an habitué of roof gardens, to meet a girl who should look like that—better, that very girl; whose hair would be drenched with golden moonlight, while at his elbow sparkling wine was poured by an unintelligible waiter."
16254,8,"When the curtain fell for the last time he gave such a long sigh that the people in front of him twisted around and stared and said loud enough for him to hear:“What a remarkable-looking boy!”This took his mind off the play, and he wondered if he really did seem handsome to the population of New York.Paskert and he walked in silence toward their hotel."
16255,8,The former was the first to speak.
16256,8,"His uncertain fifteen-year-old voice broke in in a melancholy strain on Amory’s musings:“I’d marry that girl tonight.”There was no need to ask what girl he referred to.“I’d be proud to take her home and introduce her to my people,” continued Paskert.Amory was distinctly impressed."
16257,8,He wished he had said it instead of Paskert.
16258,8,"It sounded so mature.“I wonder about actresses; are they all pretty bad?”“No, sir, not by a darn sight,” said the worldly youth with emphasis, “and I know that girl’s as good as gold."
16259,8,"I can tell.”They wandered on, mixing in the Broadway crowd, dreaming on the music that eddied out of the cafés."
16260,8,"New faces flashed on and off like myriad lights, pale or rouged faces, tired, yet sustained by a weary excitement."
16261,8,Amory watched them in fascination.
16262,8,He was planning his life.
16263,8,"He was going to live in New York, and be known at every restaurant and cafés, wearing a dress-suit from early evening to early morning, sleeping away the dull hours of the forenoon.“Yes, sir, I’d marry that girl tonight!”HEROIC IN GENERAL TONEOctober of his second and last year at St."
16264,8,Regis’s was a high point in Amory’s memory.
16265,8,"The game with Groton was played from three of a snappy, exhilarating afternoon far into the crisp autumnal twilight, and Amory at quarterback, exhorting in wild despair, making impossible tackles, calling signals in a voice that had diminished to a hoarse, furious whisper, yet found time to revel in the blood-stained bandage around his head, and the straining, glorious heroism of plunging, crashing bodies and aching limbs."
16266,8,"For those minutes courage flowed like wine out of the November dusk, and he was the eternal hero, one with the sea-rover on the prow of a Norse galley, one with Roland and Horatius, Sir Nigel and Ted Coy, scraped and stripped into trim and then flung by his own will into the breach, beating back the tide, hearing from afar the thunder of cheers ."

16280,8,"Those qualities for which he had suffered, his moodiness, his tendency to pose, his laziness, and his love of playing the fool, were now taken as a matter of course, recognized eccentricities in a star quarterback, a clever actor, and the editor of the St."
16281,8,Regis Tattler: it puzzled him to see impressionable small boys imitating the very vanities that had not long ago been contemptible weaknesses.After the football season he slumped into dreamy content.
16282,8,The night of the pre-holiday dance he slipped away and went early to bed for the pleasure of hearing the violin music cross the grass and come surging in at his window.
16283,8,"Many nights he lay there dreaming awake of secret cafés in Mont Martre, where ivory women delved in romantic mysteries with diplomats and soldiers of fortune, while orchestras played Hungarian waltzes and the air was thick and exotic with intrigue and moonlight and adventure."
16284,8,"In the spring he read L’Allegro, by request, and was inspired to lyrical outpourings on the subject of Arcady and the pipes of Pan."
16285,8,He moved his bed so that the sun would wake him at dawn that he might dress and go out to the archaic swing that hung from an apple tree near the sixth-form house.
16286,8,"Seating himself in this he would pump higher and higher until he got the effect of swinging into the wide air, into a fairyland of piping satyrs and nymphs with the faces of fair-haired girls he passed in the streets of Eastchester."
16287,8,"As the swing reached its highest point, Arcady really lay just over the brow of a certain hill, where the brown road dwindled out of sight in a golden dot.He read voluminously all spring, the beginning of his eighteenth year: The Gentleman from Indiana, The New Arabian Nights, The Morals of Marcus Ordeyne, The Man Who Was Thursday, which he liked without understanding; Stover at Yale, that became somewhat of a textbook; Dombey and Son, because he thought he really should read better stuff; Robert Chambers, David Graham Phillips, and E."
16288,8,"Phillips Oppenheim complete, and a scattering of Tennyson and Kipling."
16289,8,"Of all his class work only L’Allegro and some quality of rigid clarity in solid geometry stirred his languid interest.As June drew near, he felt the need of conversation to formulate his own ideas, and, to his surprise, found a co-philosopher in Rahill, the president of the sixth form."
16290,8,"In many a talk, on the highroad or lying belly-down along the edge of the baseball diamond, or late at night with their cigarettes glowing in the dark, they threshed out the questions of school, and there was developed the term “slicker.”“Got tobacco?” whispered Rahill one night, putting his head inside the door five minutes after lights.“Sure.”“I’m coming in.”“Take a couple of pillows and lie in the window seat, why don’t you.”Amory sat up in bed and lit a cigarette while Rahill settled for a conversation."
16291,8,"Rahill’s favorite subject was the respective futures of the sixth form, and Amory never tired of outlining them for his benefit.“Ted Converse? ’At’s easy."
16292,8,"He’ll fail his exams, tutor all summer at Harstrum’s, get into Sheff with about four conditions, and flunk out in the middle of the freshman year."
16293,8,Then he’ll go back West and raise hell for a year or so; finally his father will make him go into the paint business.
16294,8,"He’ll marry and have four sons, all bone heads."
16295,8,He’ll always think St.
16296,8,"Regis’s spoiled him, so he’ll send his sons to day school in Portland."
16297,8,"He’ll die of locomotor ataxia when he’s forty-one, and his wife will give a baptizing stand or whatever you call it to the Presbyterian Church, with his name on it—”“Hold up, Amory."
16298,8,That’s too darned gloomy.
16299,8,How about yourself?”“I’m in a superior class.
16300,8,"You are, too."
16301,8,We’re philosophers.”“I’m not.”“Sure you are.
16302,8,"You’ve got a darn good head on you.” But Amory knew that nothing in the abstract, no theory or generality, ever moved Rahill until he stubbed his toe upon the concrete minutiae of it.“Haven’t,” insisted Rahill."
16303,8,“I let people impose on me here and don’t get anything out of it.
16304,8,"I’m the prey of my friends, damn it—do their lessons, get ’em out of trouble, pay ’em stupid summer visits, and always entertain their kid sisters; keep my temper when they get selfish and then they think they pay me back by voting for me and telling me I’m the ‘big man’ of St."
16305,8,Regis’s.
16306,8,I want to get where everybody does their own work and I can tell people where to go.
16307,8,"I’m tired of being nice to every poor fish in school.”“You’re not a slicker,” said Amory suddenly.“A what?”“A slicker.”“What the devil’s that?”“Well, it’s something that—that—there’s a lot of them."
16308,8,"You’re not one, and neither am I, though I am more than you are.”“Who is one? What makes you one?”Amory considered.“Why—why, I suppose that the sign of it is when a fellow slicks his hair back with water.”“Like Carstairs?”“Yes—sure."
16309,8,He’s a slicker.”They spent two evenings getting an exact definition.
16310,8,"The slicker was good-looking or clean-looking; he had brains, social brains, that is, and he used all means on the broad path of honesty to get ahead, be popular, admired, and never in trouble."
16311,8,"He dressed well, was particularly neat in appearance, and derived his name from the fact that his hair was inevitably worn short, soaked in water or tonic, parted in the middle, and slicked back as the current of fashion dictated."
16312,8,"The slickers of that year had adopted tortoise-shell spectacles as badges of their slickerhood, and this made them so easy to recognize that Amory and Rahill never missed one."
16313,8,"The slicker seemed distributed through school, always a little wiser and shrewder than his contemporaries, managing some team or other, and keeping his cleverness carefully concealed.Amory found the slicker a most valuable classification until his junior year in college, when the outline became so blurred and indeterminate that it had to be subdivided many times, and became only a quality."
16314,8,"Amory’s secret ideal had all the slicker qualifications, but, in addition, courage and tremendous brains and talents—also Amory conceded him a bizarre streak that was quite irreconcilable to the slicker proper.This was a first real break from the hypocrisy of school tradition."
16315,8,"The slicker was a definite element of success, differing intrinsically from the prep school “big man.”“THE SLICKER”1."
16316,8,Clever sense of social values.2.
16317,8,Dresses well.
16318,8,Pretends that dress is superficial—but knows that it isn’t.3.
16319,8,Goes into such activities as he can shine in.4.
16320,8,"Gets to college and is, in a worldly way, successful.5."
16321,8,Hair slicked.“THE BIG MAN”1.
16322,8,Inclined to stupidity and unconscious of social values.2.
16323,8,"Thinks dress is superficial, and is inclined to be careless about it.3."
16324,8,Goes out for everything from a sense of duty.4.
16325,8,Gets to college and has a problematical future.
16326,8,"Feels lost without his circle, and always says that school days were happiest, after all."
16327,8,Goes back to school and makes speeches about what St.
16328,8,Regis’s boys are doing.5.
16329,8,"Hair not slicked.Amory had decided definitely on Princeton, even though he would be the only boy entering that year from St."
16330,8,Regis’s.
16331,8,"Yale had a romance and glamour from the tales of Minneapolis, and St."
16332,8,"Regis’s men who had been “tapped for Skull and Bones,” but Princeton drew him most, with its atmosphere of bright colors and its alluring reputation as the pleasantest country club in America."
16333,8,"Dwarfed by the menacing college exams, Amory’s school days drifted into the past."
16334,8,"Years afterward, when he went back to St."
16335,8,"Regis’s, he seemed to have forgotten the successes of sixth-form year, and to be able to picture himself only as the unadjustable boy who had hurried down corridors, jeered at by his rabid contemporaries mad with common sense.Chapter 2Spires and GargoylesAt first Amory noticed only the wealth of sunshine creeping across the long, green swards, dancing on the leaded windowpanes, and swimming around the tops of spires and towers and battlemented walls."
16336,8,"Gradually he realized that he was really walking up University Place, self-conscious about his suitcase, developing a new tendency to glare straight ahead when he passed any one."
16337,8,Several times he could have sworn that men turned to look at him critically.
16338,8,"He wondered vaguely if there was something the matter with his clothes, and wished he had shaved that morning on the train."
16339,8,"He felt unnecessarily stiff and awkward among these white-flannelled, bareheaded youths, who must be juniors and seniors, judging from the savoir-faire with which they strolled.He found that 12 University Place was a large, dilapidated mansion, at present apparently uninhabited, though he knew it housed usually a dozen freshmen."
16340,8,"After a hurried skirmish with his landlady he sallied out on a tour of exploration, but he had gone scarcely a block when he became horribly conscious that he must be the only man in town who was wearing a hat."
16341,8,"He returned hurriedly to 12 University, left his derby, and, emerging bareheaded, loitered down Nassau Street, stopping to investigate a display of athletic photographs in a store window, including a large one of Allenby, the football captain, and next attracted by the sign “Jigger Shop” over a confectionary window."
16342,8,"This sounded familiar, so he sauntered in and took a seat on a high stool.“Chocolate sundae,” he told a colored person.“Double chocolate jiggah? Anything else?”“Why—yes.”“Bacon bun?”“Why—yes.”He munched four of these, finding them of pleasing savor, and then consumed another double-chocolate jigger before ease descended upon him."
16343,8,"After a cursory inspection of the pillow-cases, leather pennants, and Gibson Girls that lined the walls, he left, and continued along Nassau Street with his hands in his pockets."
16344,8,"Gradually he was learning to distinguish between upper classmen and entering men, even though the freshman cap would not appear until the following Monday."
16345,8,"Those who were too obviously, too nervously at home were freshmen, for as each train brought a new contingent it was immediately absorbed into the hatless, white-shod, book-laden throng, whose function seemed to be to drift endlessly up and down the street, emitting great clouds of smoke from brand-new pipes."
16346,8,"By afternoon Amory realized that now the newest arrivals were taking him for an upper classman, and he tried conscientiously to look both pleasantly blasé and casually critical, which was as near as he could analyze the prevalent facial expression.At five o’clock he felt the need of hearing his own voice, so he retreated to his house to see if anyone else had arrived."
16347,8,"Having climbed the rickety stairs he scrutinized his room resignedly, concluding that it was hopeless to attempt any more inspired decoration than class banners and tiger pictures."
16348,8,There was a tap at the door.“Come in!”A slim face with gray eyes and a humorous smile appeared in the doorway.“Got a hammer?”“No—sorry.
16349,8,Maybe Mrs.
16350,8,"Twelve, or whatever she goes by, has one.”The stranger advanced into the room.“You an inmate of this asylum?”Amory nodded.“Awful barn for the rent we pay.”Amory had to agree that it was.“I thought of the campus,” he said, “but they say there’s so few freshmen that they’re lost."
16351,8,Have to sit around and study for something to do.”The gray-eyed man decided to introduce himself.“My name’s Holiday.”“Blaine’s my name.”They shook hands with the fashionable low swoop.
16352,8,Amory grinned.“Where’d you prep?”“Andover—where did you?”“St.
16353,8,"Regis’s.”“Oh, did you? I had a cousin there.”They discussed the cousin thoroughly, and then Holiday announced that he was to meet his brother for dinner at six.“Come along and have a bite with us.”“All right.”At the Kenilworth Amory met Burne Holiday—he of the gray eyes was Kerry—and during a limpid meal of thin soup and anemic vegetables they stared at the other freshmen, who sat either in small groups looking very ill at ease, or in large groups seeming very much at home.“I hear Commons is pretty bad,” said Amory.“That’s the rumor."
16354,8,"But you’ve got to eat there—or pay anyways.”“Crime!”“Imposition!”“Oh, at Princeton you’ve got to swallow everything the first year."
16355,8,"It’s like a damned prep school.”Amory agreed.“Lot of pep, though,” he insisted."
16356,8,"“I wouldn’t have gone to Yale for a million.”“Me either.”“You going out for anything?” inquired Amory of the elder brother.“Not me—Burne here is going out for the Prince—the Daily Princetonian, you know.”“Yes, I know.”“You going out for anything?”“Why—yes."
16357,8,I’m going to take a whack at freshman football.”“Play at St.
16358,8,"Regis’s?”“Some,” admitted Amory depreciatingly, “but I’m getting so damned thin.”“You’re not thin.”“Well, I used to be stocky last fall.”“Oh!”After supper they attended the movies, where Amory was fascinated by the glib comments of a man in front of him, as well as by the wild yelling and shouting.“Yoho!”“Oh, honey-baby—you’re so big and strong, but oh, so gentle!”“Clinch!”“Oh, clinch!”“Kiss her, kiss ‘at lady, quick!”“Oh-h-h—!”A group began whistling “By the Sea,” and the audience took it up noisily."
16359,8,"This was followed by an indistinguishable song that included much stamping and then by an endless, incoherent dirge.“Oh-h-h-h-hShe works in a Jam FactoreeAnd—that-may-be-all-rightBut you can’t-fool-me For I know—DAMN—WELLThat she DON’T-make-jam-all-night!Oh-h-h-h!”As they pushed out, giving and receiving curious impersonal glances, Amory decided that he liked the movies, wanted to enjoy them as the row of upper classmen in front had enjoyed them, with their arms along the backs of the seats, their comments Gaelic and caustic, their attitude a mixture of critical wit and tolerant amusement.“Want a sundae—I mean a jigger?” asked Kerry.“Sure.”They suppered heavily and then, still sauntering, eased back to 12.“Wonderful night.”“It’s a whiz.”“You men going to unpack?”“Guess so."
16360,8,"Come on, Burne.”Amory decided to sit for a while on the front steps, so he bade them good night.The great tapestries of trees had darkened to ghosts back at the last edge of twilight."
16361,8,"The early moon had drenched the arches with pale blue, and, weaving over the night, in and out of the gossamer rifts of moon, swept a song, a song with more than a hint of sadness, infinitely transient, infinitely regretful.He remembered that an alumnus of the nineties had told him of one of Booth Tarkington’s amusements: standing in mid-campus in the small hours and singing tenor songs to the stars, arousing mingled emotions in the couched undergraduates according to the sentiment of their moods.Now, far down the shadowy line of University Place a white-clad phalanx broke the gloom, and marching figures, white-shirted, white-trousered, swung rhythmically up the street, with linked arms and heads thrown back:“Going back—going back,Going—back—to—Nas-sau—Hall,Going back—going back—To the—Best—Old—Place—of—All.Going back—going back,From all—this—earth-ly—ball,We’ll—clear—the—track—as—we—go—back—Going—back—to—Nas-sau—Hall!”Amory closed his eyes as the ghostly procession drew near."
16362,8,"The song soared so high that all dropped out except the tenors, who bore the melody triumphantly past the danger-point and relinquished it to the fantastic chorus."
16363,8,"Then Amory opened his eyes, half afraid that sight would spoil the rich illusion of harmony.He sighed eagerly."
16364,8,"There at the head of the white platoon marched Allenby, the football captain, slim and defiant, as if aware that this year the hopes of the college rested on him, that his hundred-and-sixty pounds were expected to dodge to victory through the heavy blue and crimson lines.Fascinated, Amory watched each rank of linked arms as it came abreast, the faces indistinct above the polo shirts, the voices blent in a paean of triumph—and then the procession passed through shadowy Campbell Arch, and the voices grew fainter as it wound eastward over the campus.The minutes passed and Amory sat there very quietly."
16365,8,"He regretted the rule that would forbid freshmen to be outdoors after curfew, for he wanted to ramble through the shadowy scented lanes, where Witherspoon brooded like a dark mother over Whig and Clio, her Attic children, where the black Gothic snake of Little curled down to Cuyler and Patton, these in turn flinging the mystery out over the placid slope rolling to the lake.Princeton of the daytime filtered slowly into his consciousness—West and Reunion, redolent of the sixties, Seventy-nine Hall, brick-red and arrogant, Upper and Lower Pyne, aristocratic Elizabethan ladies not quite content to live among shopkeepers, and, topping all, climbing with clear blue aspiration, the great dreaming spires of Holder and Cleveland towers.From the first he loved Princeton—its lazy beauty, its half-grasped significance, the wild moonlight revel of the rushes, the handsome, prosperous big-game crowds, and under it all the air of struggle that pervaded his class."
16366,8,"From the day when, wild-eyed and exhausted, the jerseyed freshmen sat in the gymnasium and elected someone from Hill School class president, a Lawrenceville celebrity vice-president, a hockey star from St."
16367,8,"Paul’s secretary, up until the end of sophomore year it never ceased, that breathless social system, that worship, seldom named, never really admitted, of the bogey “Big Man.”First it was schools, and Amory, alone from St."
16368,8,"Regis,’ watched the crowds form and widen and form again; St."
16369,8,"Paul’s, Hill, Pomfret, eating at certain tacitly reserved tables in Commons, dressing in their own corners of the gymnasium, and drawing unconsciously about them a barrier of the slightly less important but socially ambitious to protect them from the friendly, rather puzzled high school element."
16370,8,"From the moment he realized this Amory resented social barriers as artificial distinctions made by the strong to bolster up their weak retainers and keep out the almost strong.Having decided to be one of the gods of the class, he reported for freshman football practice, but in the second week, playing quarterback, already paragraphed in corners of the Princetonian, he wrenched his knee seriously enough to put him out for the rest of the season."
16371,8,This forced him to retire and consider the situation.“12 Univee” housed a dozen miscellaneous question marks.
16372,8,"There were three or four inconspicuous and quite startled boys from Lawrenceville, two amateur wild men from a New York private school (Kerry Holiday christened them the “plebeian drunks”), a Jewish youth, also from New York, and, as compensation for Amory, the two Holidays, to whom he took an instant fancy.The Holidays were rumored twins, but really the dark-haired one, Kerry, was a year older than his blond brother, Burne."
16373,8,"Kerry was tall, with humorous gray eyes, and a sudden, attractive smile; he became at once the mentor of the house, reaper of ears that grew too high, censor of conceit, vendor of rare, satirical humor."
16374,8,Amory spread the table of their future friendship with all his ideas of what college should and did mean.
16375,8,"Kerry, not inclined as yet to take things seriously, chided him gently for being curious at this inopportune time about the intricacies of the social system, but liked him and was both interested and amused.Burne, fair-haired, silent, and intent, appeared in the house only as a busy apparition, gliding in quietly at night and off again in the early morning to get up his work in the library—he was out for the Princetonian, competing furiously against forty others for the coveted first place."
16376,8,"In December he came down with diphtheria, and someone else won the competition, but, returning to college in February, he dauntlessly went after the prize again."
16377,8,"Necessarily, Amory’s acquaintance with him was in the way of three-minute chats, walking to and from lectures, so he failed to penetrate Burne’s one absorbing interest and find what lay beneath it.Amory was far from contented."
16378,8,He missed the place he had won at St.
16379,8,"Regis’s, the being known and admired, yet Princeton stimulated him, and there were many things ahead calculated to arouse the Machiavelli latent in him, could he but insert a wedge."
16380,8,"The upper-class clubs, concerning which he had pumped a reluctant graduate during the previous summer, excited his curiosity: Ivy, detached and breathlessly aristocratic; Cottage, an impressive mélange of brilliant adventurers and well-dressed philanderers; Tiger Inn, broad-shouldered and athletic, vitalized by an honest elaboration of prep school standards; Cap and Gown, anti-alcoholic, faintly religious and politically powerful; flamboyant Colonial; literary Quadrangle; and the dozen others, varying in age and position.Anything which brought an under classman into too glaring a light was labelled with the damning brand of “running it out.” The movies thrived on caustic comments, but the men who made them were generally running it out; talking of clubs was running it out; standing for anything very strongly, as, for instance, drinking parties or teetotalling, was running it out; in short, being personally conspicuous was not tolerated, and the influential man was the non-committal man, until at club elections in sophomore year everyone should be sewed up in some bag for the rest of his college career.Amory found that writing for the Nassau Literary Magazine would get him nothing, but that being on the board of the Daily Princetonian would get any one a good deal."
16381,8,"His vague desire to do immortal acting with the English Dramatic Association faded out when he found that the most ingenious brains and talents were concentrated upon the Triangle Club, a musical comedy organization that every year took a great Christmas trip."
16382,8,"In the meanwhile, feeling strangely alone and restless in Commons, with new desires and ambitions stirring in his mind, he let the first term go by between an envy of the embryo successes and a puzzled fretting with Kerry as to why they were not accepted immediately among the elite of the class.Many afternoons they lounged in the windows of 12 Univee and watched the class pass to and from Commons, noting satellites already attaching themselves to the more prominent, watching the lonely grind with his hurried step and downcast eye, envying the happy security of the big school groups.“We’re the damned middle class, that’s what!” he complained to Kerry one day as he lay stretched out on the sofa, consuming a family of Fatimas with contemplative precision.“Well, why not? We came to Princeton so we could feel that way toward the small colleges—have it on ’em, more self-confidence, dress better, cut a swathe—”“Oh, it isn’t that I mind the glittering caste system,” admitted Amory."
16383,8,"“I like having a bunch of hot cats on top, but gosh, Kerry, I’ve got to be one of them.”“But just now, Amory, you’re only a sweaty bourgeois.”Amory lay for a moment without speaking.“I won’t be—long,” he said finally."
16384,8,“But I hate to get anywhere by working for it.
16385,8,"I’ll show the marks, don’t you know.”“Honorable scars.” Kerry craned his neck suddenly at the street."
16386,8,"“There’s Langueduc, if you want to see what he looks like—and Humbird just behind.”Amory rose dynamically and sought the windows.“Oh,” he said, scrutinizing these worthies, “Humbird looks like a knock-out, but this Langueduc—he’s the rugged type, isn’t he? I di."
16387,8,"On the pleasant shore of the French Riviera, about half waybetween Marseilles and the Italian border, stands a large,proud, rose-colored hotel."
16388,8,"Deferential palms cool its flushedfacade, and before it stretches a short dazzling beach."
16389,8,Latelyit has become a summer resort of notable and fashionablepeople; a decade ago it was almost deserted after its Englishclientele went north in April.
16390,8,"Now, many bungalows clusternear it, but when this story begins only the cupolas of a dozenold villas rotted like water lilies among the massed pines be-tween Gausses H6tel des Strangers and Cannes, five milesaway."
16391,8,"  The hotel and its bright tan prayer rug of a beach were one.In the early morning the distant image of Cannes, the pink andcream of old fortifications, the purple Alp that bounded Italy,were cast across the water and lay quavering in the ripplesand rings sent up by sea-plants through the clear shallows.Before eight a man came down to the beach in a blue bathrobeand with much preliminary application to his person of thechilly water, and much grunting and loud breathing, floundered a minute in the sea."
16392,8,"When he had gone, beach and baywere quiet for an hour."
16393,8,Merchantmen crawled westward onthe horizon; bus boys shouted in the hotel court; the dew driedupon the pines.
16394,8,"In another hour the horns of motors began toblow down from the winding road along the low range of theMaures, which separates the littoral from true ProvengalFrance.1210                      TENDER IS THE NIGHT    A mile from the sea, where pines give way to dusty pop-lars, is an isolated railroad stop, whence one June morningin 1925 a victoria brought a woman and her daughter downto Gausse's Hotel."
16395,8,The mother s face was of a fading pretti-ness that would soon be patted with broken veins; her expres-sion was both tranquil and aware in a pleasant way.
16396,8,"However,one’s eye moved on quickly to her daughter, who had magicin her pink palms and her cheeks lit to a lovely flame, like thethrilling flush of children after their cold baths in the evening.Her fine forehead sloped gently up to where her hair, border-ing it like an armorial shield, burst into lovelocks and wavesand curlicues of ash blonde and gold."
16397,8,"Her eyes were bright,big, clear, wet, and shining, the color of her cheeks was real,breaking close to the surface from the strong young pump ofher heart."
16398,8,"Her body hovered delicately on the last edge ofchildhood—she was almost eighteen, nearly complete, but thedew was still on her."
16399,8,"   As sea and sky appeared below them in a thin, hot line themother said:    “Something tells me we’re not going to like this place.”   “I want to go home anyhow,” the girl answered."
16400,8,"   They both spoke cheerfully but were obviously without direction and bored by the fact—moreover, just any directionwould not do."
16401,8,"They wanted high excitement, not from thenecessity of stimulating jaded nerves but with the avidity ofprize-winning schoolchildren who deserved their vacations."
16402,8,   “We 11 stay three days and then go home.
16403,8,"Ill wire right awayfor steamer tickets.”   At the hotel the girl made the reservation in idiomatic butrather flat French, like something remembered."
16404,8,When theywere installed on the ground floor she walked into the glareof the French windows and out a few steps onto the stoneveranda that ran the length of the hotel.
16405,8,"When she walked shecarried herself like a ballet-dancer, not slumped down on herhips but held up in the small of her back."
16406,8,Out there the hotnight clipped close her shadow and she retreated—it was toobright to see.
16407,8,"Fifty yards away the Mediteiraneanup its pigments, moment by moment, to the brutal sunshine;below the balustrade a faded Buick cooked on the hotel drive."
16408,8,"  Indeed, of all the region only the beach stirred with activity.Three British nannies sat knitting the slow pattern ofVictorian England, the pattern of the forties, the sixties, andthe eighties, into sweaters and socks, to the tune of gossip asformalized as incantation; closer to the sea a dozen personskept house under striped umbrellas, while their dozen childrenpursued unintimidated fish through the shallows or lay nakedand glistening with cocoanut oil out in the sun."
16409,8,  As Rosemary came onto the beach a boy of twelve ran pasther and dashed into the sea with exultant cries.
16410,8,"Feeling theimpactive scrutiny of strange faces, she took off her bathrobeand followed."
16411,8,"She floated face down for a few yards and find-ing it shallow staggered to her feet and plodded forward,dragging slim legs like weights against the resistance of thewater."
16412,8,"When it was about breast high, she glanced back towardshore: a bald man in a monocle and a pair of tights, his tuftedchest thrown out, his brash navel sucked in, was regardingher attentively."
16413,8,"As Rosemary returned the gaze the man dis-lodged the monocle, which went into hiding amid the facetiouswhiskers of his chest, and poured himself a glass ofsomething from a bottle in his hand."
16414,8,  Rosemary laid her face on the water and swam a choppylittle four-beat crawl out to the raft.
16415,8,"The water reached upfor her, pulled her down tenderly out of the heat, seeped inher hair and ran into the comers of her body."
16416,8,"She turned roundand round in it, embracing it, wallowing in it."
16417,8,"Reaching the raftshe was out of breath, but a tanned woman with very whiteteeth looked down at her, and Rosemary, suddenly consciousof the raw whiteness of her own body, turned on her backand drifted toward shore."
16418,8,The hairy man holding the bottlespoke to her as she came out.
16419,8,"  *T say—they have sharks out behind the raft.*^ He was of in-determinate nationality, but spoke English with a slow Oxford14                          TENDER IS THE NIGHTdrawl."
16420,8,"'TTesterday they devoured two British sailors from theflotte at Golfe Juan ""   ""Heavens!” exclaimed Rosemary."
16421,8,"  ""They come in for the refuse from the flotte.”    Glazing his eyes to indicate that he had only spoken in orderto warn her, he minced off two steps and poured himselfanother drink."
16422,8,"   Not unpleasantly self-conscious, since there had been a slightsway of attention toward her during this conversation, Rose-mary looked for a place to sit."
16423,8,Obviously each family possessedthe strip of sand immediately in front of its umbrella; besidesthere was much visiting and talking back and forth—the at-mosphere of a community upon which it would be presump-tuous to intrude.
16424,8,"Farther up, where the beach was strewn withpebbles and dead sea-weed, sat a group with flesh as white asher own."
16425,8,"They lay under small hand-parasols instead of beachumbrellas and were obviously less indigenous to the place.Between the dark people and the light, Rosemary found roomand spread out her peignoir on the sand."
16426,8,"   Lying so, she first heard their voices and felt their feet skirther body and their shapes pass between the sun and herself.The breath of an inquisitive dog blew warm and nervous onher neck; she could feel her skin broiling a little in the heatand hear the small exhausted wa-t^aa of the expiring waves.Presently her ear distinguished individual voices and she be-came aware that some one referred to scornfully as ""that Northguy” had kidnapped a waiter from a caf6 in Cannes last nightin order to saw him in two."
16427,8,"The sponsor of the story was awhite-haired woman in full evening dress, obviously a relicof the previous evening, for a tiara still clung to her head anda discouraged orchid expired from her shoulder, Rosemary,forming a vague antipathy to her and her companions, turnedaway."
16428,8,"   Nearest her, on the other side, a young woman lay under aroof of umbrellas making out a list of things from a book openon the sand."
16429,8,"Her bathing suit was pulled off her shoulders and15            ”                          TENDER IS THE NIGHT                             I3her baclc, a ruddy, orange brown, set off by a string of creamypearls, shone in the sun."
16430,8,Her face was hard and lovely and piti-ful Her eyes met Rosemary s but did not see her.
16431,8,"Beyond herwas a fine man in a jockey cap and red-striped tights; thenthe woman Rosemary had seen on the raft, and who lookedback at her, seeing her; then a man with a long face and agolden, leonine head, with blue tights and no hat, talking veryseriously to an unmistakably Latin young man in black tights,both of them picking at little pieces of sea-weed in the sand.She thought they were mostly Americans, but something madethem unlike the Americans she had known of late."
16432,8,"  After a while she realized that the man in the jockey cap wasgiving a quiet little performance for this group; he movedgravely about with a rake, ostensibly removing gravel andmeanwhile developing some esoteric burlesque held in sus-pension by his grave face."
16433,8,"Its faintest ramification had becomehilarious, until whatever he said released a burst of laughter.Even those who, like herself, were too far away to hear, sentout antennae of attention until the only person on the beachnot caught up in it was the young woman with the string ofpearls."
16434,8,Perhaps from modesty of possession she responded toeach salvo of amusement by bending closer over her list.
16435,8,  The man of the monocle and bottle spoke suddenly out ofthe sky above Rosemary.
16436,8,"  ‘""You are a ripping swimmer.""""""   She demurred."
16437,8,"  ^""Jolly good."
16438,8,My name is Campion.
16439,8,Here is a lady who saysshe saw you in Sorrento last week and knows who you areand would so like to meet you.”   Glancing around with concealed annoyance Rosemary sawthe untanned people were waiting.
16440,8,Reluctantly she got upand went over to them.

16447,8,She was one of those elderly “good sports” pre-served by an imperviousness to experience and a good diges-tion into another generation.
16448,8,"  “We wanted to warn you about getting burned the first day,""'she continued cheerily, “because your skin is important, butthere seems to be so darn much formality on this beach thatwe didn’t know whether you d mind.”                                   CHAPTER 2“We thought maybe you were in the plot,” said Mrs."
16449,8,"McKisco.She was a shabby-eyed, pretty young woman with a disheart-ening intensity."
16450,8,“We don’t know who’s in the plot and whoisn’t.
16451,8,"One man my husband had been particularly nice to turnedout to be a chief character—practically the assistant hero.”   “The plot?” inquired Rosemary, half understanding, “Isthere a plot?”    “My dear, we don’t fcnotu,” said Mrs."
16452,8,"Abrams, with a con-vulsive, stout woman’s chuckle."
16453,8,“We’re not in it.

16455,8,"Dumphry, a tow-headed effeminate young man, re-marked: “Mama Abrams is a plot in herself,” and Campionshook his monocle at him, saying: “Now, Royal, don’t be tooghastly for words.” Rosemary looked at them all uncomfort-ably, wishing her mother had come down here with her."
16456,8,"Shedid not Hke these people, especially in her immediate compari-son of them with those who had interested her at the other endof the beach."
16457,8,Her mother’s modest but compact social giftgot them out of unwelcome situations swiftly and firmly.
16458,8,"ButRosemary had been a celebrity for only six months, and some-17                          TENDER IS THE NIGHT                            I5times the French manners of her early adolescence and thedemocratic manners of America, these latter superimposed,made a certain confusion and let her in for just such things."
16459,8,  Mr.
16460,8,"McKisco, a scrawny, frecHe-and-red man of thirty, didnot find the topic of the ""plot” amusing."
16461,8,"He had been staringat the sea—now after a swift glance at his wife he turned toRosemary and demanded aggressively:   ""Been here long?”   ""Only a day”   ""Oh.”   Evidently feeling that the subject had been thoroughlychanged, he looked in turn at the others."
16462,8,"  ""Going to stay all summer?” asked Mrs."
16463,8,"McKisco, innocently.""If you do you can watch the plot unfold.”   ""For Gods sake, Violet, drop the subject!” exploded herhusband."
16464,8,"""Get a new joke, for God’s sake!”   Mrs."
16465,8,McKisco swayed toward Mrs.
16466,8,"Abrams and breathedaudibly:   ""He’s nervous.”   ""I’m not nervous,” disagreed McKisco."
16467,8,"""It just happens I’mnot nervous at all.”   He was burning visibly—a grayish flush had spread over hisface, dissolving aU his expressions into a vast ineffectuality.Suddenly remotely conscious of his condition he got up to goin the water, followed by his wife, and seizing the opportunityRosemary followed."
16468,8,  Mr.
16469,8,"McKisco drew a long breath, flung himself into the shal-lows and began a stiff-armed batting of the Mediterranean,obviously intended to suggest a crawl—his breath exhaustedhe arose and looked around with an expression of surprise thathe was still in sight of shore."
16470,8,"  ""I haven’t learned to breathe yet."
16471,8,I never quite understoodhow they breathed.” He looked at Rosemary inquiringly.
16472,8,"  ""I think you breathe out under water,” she explained."
16473,8,"“Andevery fourth beat you roll your head over for air.”18i6                       TENDER IS THE NIGHT   ""The breathing’s the hardest part for me."
16474,8,"Shall we go to theraft?""   The man with the leonine head lay stretched out upon theraft, which tipped back and forth with the motion of the water.As Mrs."
16475,8,"McKisco reached for it a sudden tilt struck her arm uproughly, whereupon the man started up and pulled her onboard,   “I was afraid it hit you."" His voice was slow and shy; he hadone of the saddest faces Rosemary had ever seen, the highcheekbones of an Indian, a long upper lip, and enormous deep-set dark golden eyes."
16476,8,"He had spoken out of the side of hismouth, as if he hoped his words would reach Mrs."
16477,8,McKiscoby a circuitous and unobtrusive route; in a minute he hadshoved off into the water and his long body lay motionlesstoward shore.
16478,8,   Rosemary and Mrs.
16479,8,McKisco watched him.
16480,8,"When he hadexhausted his momentum he abruptly bent double, his thinthighs rose above the surface, and he disappeared totally, leav-ing scarcely a fleck of foam behind."
16481,8,"   ""He s a good swimmer,"" Rosemary said."
16482,8,  Mrs.
16483,8,McKisco’s answer came with surprising violence.
16484,8,"  ""Well, he s a rotten musician."" She turned to her husband,who after two unsuccessful attempts had managed to climbon the raft, and having attained his balance was trying to makesome kind of compensatory flourish, achieving only an extrastagger."
16485,8,"""I was just saying that Abe North may be a goodswimmer but he’s a rotten musician.”   ""Yes,"" agreed McKisco, grudgingly."
16486,8,"Obviously he had cre-ated his wife’s world, and allowed her few liberties in it."
16487,8,"  ""Antheils my man."" Mrs."
16488,8,"McKisco turned challengingly toRosemary, ""Antheil and Joyce."
16489,8,"I don’t suppose you ever hearmuch about those sort of people in Hollywood, but my hus-band wrote the first criticism of Ulysses that ever appeared inAmerica.""   ""I wish I had a cigarette,"" said McKisco calmly."

16491,8,"The woman of the pearls hadjoined her two children in the water, and now Abe North cameup under one of them like a volcanic island, raising him onhis shoulders."
16492,8,"The child yelled with fear and delight and thewoman watched with a lovely peace, without a smile."
16493,8,"  ""Is that his wife?” Rosemary asked."
16494,8,"  ""No, that’s Mrs."
16495,8,Diver.
16496,8,"They’re not at the hotel.” Her eyes,photographic, did not move from the woman’s face."
16497,8,After amoment she turned vehemently to Rosemary.
16498,8,"  ""Have you been abroad before?”   ""Yes—I went to school in Paris.”   ""Ohl Well then you probably know that if you want to enjoyyourself here the thing is to get to know some real Frenchfamilies."
16499,8,What do these people get out of it?” She pointedher left shoulder toward shore.
16500,8,"""They just stick around witheach other in little cliques."
16501,8,"Of course, we had letters of in-troduction and met all the best French artists and writers inParis."
16502,8,"That made it very nice.”    ""I should think so.”    ""My husband is finishing his first novel, you see.”    Rosemary said: ""Oh, he is?” She was not thinking anythingspecial, except wondering whether her mother had got to sleepin this heat."
16503,8,"  ""It’s on the idea of Ulysses,” continued Mrs."
16504,8,McKisco.
16505,8,"""Onlyinstead of taking twenty-four hours my husband takes a hun-dred years."
16506,8,"He takes a decayed old French aristocrat and putshim in contrast with the mechanical age    ""Oh, for God’s sake, Violet, don’t go telling everybody theidea,” protested McKisco."
16507,8,"""I don’t want it to get aU aroundbefore the book’s published.”    Rosemary swam back to the shore, where she threw herpeignoir over her already sore shoulders and lay down againin the sun."
16508,8,The man with the jockey cap was now going fromumbrella to umbrella carrying a bottle and little glasses in hishands; presently he and his friends grew livelier and closer to-20l8                       TENDER IS THE NIGHTgetlier and now they were all under a single assemblage of tim-brellas—she gathered that some one was leaving and that thiswas a last drink on the beach.
16509,8,Even the children knew thatexcitement was generating under that umbrella and turnedtoward it—and it seemed to Rosemary that it all came fromthe man in the jockey cap.
16510,8,"  Noon dominated sea and sky—even the white line ofCannes, five miles off, had faded to a mirage of what was freshand cool; a robin-breasted sailing boat pulled in behind it astrand from the outer, darker sea."
16511,8,"It seemed that there wasno life anywhere in all this expanse of coast except under thefiltered sunlight of those umbrellas, where something went onamid the color and the murmur."
16512,8,"   Campion walked near her, stood a few feet away and Rose-mary closed her eyes, pretending to be asleep; then she half-opened them and watched two dim, blurred pillars that werelegs."
16513,8,"The man tried to edge his way into a sand-colored cloud,but the cloud floated off into the vast hot sky."
16514,8,Rosemary fellreally asleep.
16515,8,"   She awoke drenched with sweat to find the beach desertedsave for the man in the jockey cap, who was folding a last um-brella, As Rosemary lay blinking, he walked nearer and said:   “I was going to wake you before I left."
16516,8,"It's not good to gettoo burned right away.''    ‘""Thank you."" Rosemary looked down at her crimson legs."
16517,8,"  “Heavens!""    She laughed cheerfully, inviting him to talk, but Dick Diverwas already carrying a tent and a beach umbrella up to a wait-ing car, so she went into the water to wash off the sweat."
16518,8,"Hecame back and gathering up a rake, a shovel, and a sieve,stowed them in a crevice of a rock."
16519,8,He glanced up and downthe beach to see if he had left anything.
16520,8,"  “Do you know what time it is?"" Rosemary asked."
16521,8,"  “It's about half-past one.""   They faced the seascape together momentarily.21                         TENDER IS THE NIGHT                             IQ   ""It’s not a bad time/' said Dick Diver."
16522,8,"“Its not one of theworst times of the day.""   He looked at her and for a moment she lived in the brightblue worlds of his eyes, eagerly and confidently."
16523,8,"Then he shoul-dered his last piece of junk and went up to his car, and Rose-mary came out of the water, shook out her peignoir and walkedup to the hotel."
16524,8,                                  CHAPTER 3It was almost two when they went into the dining-room.
16525,8,"Backand forth over the deserted tables a heavy pattern of beamsand shadows swayed with the motion of the pines outside.Two waiteis, piling plates and talking loud Italian, fell silentwhen they came in and brought them a tired version of thetable d’h6te luncheon."
16526,8,"  “I fell in love on the beach,” said Rosemary."
16527,8,"  ""Who with?”    “First with a whole lot of people who looked nice."
16528,8,Thenwith one man.”   “Did you talk to him?”   “Just a little.
16529,8,Very handsome.
16530,8,"With reddish hair.” She waseating, ravenously."
16531,8,"“He's married though—it’s usually the way.”   Her mother was her best friend and had put every last possi-bility into the guiding of her, not so rare a thing in the theat-rical profession, but rather special in that Mrs."
16532,8,Elsie Speerswas not recompensing heiself for a defeat of her own.
16533,8,"She hadno personal bitterness or resentments about life—twice satis-factorily married and twice widowed, her cheerful stoicismhad each time deepened."
16534,8,"One of her husbands had been acavalry officer and one an army doctor, and they both left some-thing to her that she tried to present intact to Rosemary."
16535,8,"Bynot sparing Rosemary she had made her hard—by not sparingher own labor and devotion she had cultivated an idealism inRosemary, which at present was directed toward herself and2220                      TENDER IS THE NIGHTsaw die world through her eyes."
16536,8,"So that while Rosemary was a“simple” child she was protected by a double sheath of hermother s armor and her own—she had a mature distrust ofdie trivial, the facile and the vulgar."
16537,8,"However, with Rosemary ssudden success in pictures Mrs."
16538,8,"Speers felt that it was timeshe were spiritually weaned; it would please rather than painher if this somewhat bouncing, breathless and exigent idealismwould focus on something except herself."
16539,8,  “Then you like it here?” she asked.
16540,8,   “It might be fun if we knew those people.
16541,8,"There were someother people, but they weren’t nice."
16542,8,"They recognized me—no matter where we go everybody’s seen ""Daddy’s Girl.’”    Mrs."
16543,8,"Speers waited for the glow of egotism to subside; thenshe said in a matter-of-fact way: “That reminds me, when areyou going to see Earl Brady?”    “I thought we might go this afternoon—if you’re rested.”    “You go—I’m not going.”    “We’ll wait till to-morrow then.”    “I want you to go alone."
16544,8,"It’s only a short way—it isn’t as ifyou didn’t speak French.”   “Mother—aren’t there some things I don’t have to do?”    “Oh, well then go later—but some day before we leave.”   “AU right, Mother.”    After lunch they were both overwhelmed by the suddenflatness that comes over American travellers in quiet foreignplaces."
16545,8,"No stimuli worked upon them, no voices called themfrom without, no fragments of their own thoughts came sud-denly from the minds of others, and missing the clamor ofEmpire they felt that life was not continuing here."
16546,8,"  “Let’s only stay three days, Mother,” Rosemary said whenthey were back in their rooms."
16547,8,"Outside a light wind blew theheat around, straining it through the trees and sending littlehot gusts through the shutters."
16548,8,  “How about the man you fell in love with on the beach?”   “I don’t love anybody but you.
16549,8,"Mother, darling.”   Rosemary stopped in the lobby and spoke to Gausse p^re23                         TENDER IS THE NIGHT                             21about trains."
16550,8,"The concierge, lounging in light-brown khaki bythe desk, stared at her rigidly, then suddenly remembered themanners of his metier."
16551,8,"She took the bus and rode with a pairof obsequious waiters to the station, embarrassed by theirdeferential silence, wanting to urge them: ""Go on, talk, enjoyyourselves."
16552,8,"It doesn’t bother me.”   The first-class compartment was stifling; the vivid advertis-ing cards of the railroad companies—The Pont du Card atArles, the Ampitheatre at Orange, winter sports at Chamonix—were fresher than the long motionless sea outside."
16553,8,"UnlikeAmerican trains that were absorbed in an intense destiny oftheir own, and scornful of people on another world less swiftand breathless, this train was part of the country through whichit passed."
16554,8,"Its breath stirred the dust from the palm leaves,the cinders mingled with the dry dung in the gardens."
16555,8,Rose-mary was sure she could lean from the window and pullflowers with her hand.
16556,8,  A dozen cabbies slept in their hacks outside the Cannes sta-tion.
16557,8,"Over on the promenade the Casino, the smart shops, andthe great hotels turned blank iron masks to the summer sea.It was unbelievable that there could ever have been a ""season,”and Rosemary, half in the grip of fashion, became a little self-conscious, as though she were displaying an unhealthy tastefor the moribund; as though people were wondering why shewas here in the lull between the gaiety of last winter and nextwinter, while up north the true world thundered by."
16558,8,"   As she came out of a drug store with a bottle of cocoanutoil, a woman, whom she recognized as Mrs, Diver, crossed herpath with arms full of sofa cushions, and went to a car parkeddown the street."
16559,8,"A long, low black dog barked at her, a dozingchauffeur woke with a start."
16560,8,"She sat in the car, her lovely faceset, controlled, her eyes brave and watchful, looking straightahead toward nothing."
16561,8,Her dress was bright red and her brownlegs were bare.
16562,8,"She had thick, dark, gold hair like a chow’s."
16563,8,"   With half an hour to wait for her traia Rosemary sat down242.%                    TENDER IS THE NIGHTin the CafS des Allies on the Croisette, where the trees madea green twilight over the tables and an orchestra wooed animaginary public of cosmopolites with the Nice Carnival Songand last years American tune."
16564,8,"She had bought Le Temps andThe Saturday Evening Post for her mother, and as she drankher citronade she opened the latter at the memoirs of a Rus-sian princess, finding the dim conventions of the nineties realerand nearer than the headlines of the French paper."
16565,8,"It was thesame feeling that had oppressed her at the hotel—accustomedto seeing the starkest grotesqueries of a continent heavilyunderlined as comedy or tragedy, untrained to the task ofseparating out the essential for herself, she now began to feelthat French life was empty and stale."
16566,8,"This feeling was sur-charged by listening to the sad tunes of the orchestra,reminiscent of the melancholy music played for acrobats invaudeville."
16567,8,She was glad to go back to Gausse’s Hotel.
16568,8,"  Her shoulders were too burned to swim with the next day,so she and her mother hired a car—after much haggling, forRosemary had formed her valuations of money in France—and drove along the Riviera, the delta of many rivers."
16569,8,"Thechauffeur, a Russian Czar of the period of Ivan the Terrible,was a self-appointed guide, and the resplendent names—Cannes, Nice, Monte Carlo—began to glow through their tor-pid camouflage, whispering of old kings come here to dine ordie, of rajahs tossing Buddha's eyes to English ballerinas, ofRussian princes turning the weeks into Baltic twilights in thelost caviare days."
16570,8,"Most of all, there was the scent of the Rus-sians along the coast—their closed book shops and grocerystores."
16571,8,"Ten years ago, when the season ended in April, thedoors of the Orthodox Church were locked, and the sweetchampagnes they favored were put away until their return.“Well be back next season,” they said, but this was premature,for they were never coming back any more."
16572,8,"  It was pleasant to drive back to the hotel in the late after-noon, above a sea as mysteriously colored as the agates andcornelians of childhood, green as green milk, blue as laundry25                          TENDER IS THE NIGHT                            ^3water, wine dark."
16573,8,"It was pleasant to pass people eating outsidetheir doors, and to hear the fierce raechanical pianos behindthe vines of country estaminets."
16574,8,"When they turned off theCorniche d’Or and down to Gausse s Hotel through the darken-ing banks of trees, set one behind another in many greens, themoon already hovered over the ruins of the aqueducts."
16575,8,.
16576,8,.
16577,8,"    Somewhere in the hills behind the hotel there was a dance,and Rosemary listened to the music through the ghostly moon-shine of her mosquito net, realizing that there was gaiety toosomewhere about, and she thought of the nice people on thebeach."
16578,8,"She thought she might meet them in the morning, butthey obviously formed a self-suiBScient little group, and oncetheir umbrellas, bamboo rugs, dogs, and children were setout in place the part of the plage was literally fenced in."
16579,8,Sheresolved in any case not to spend her last two mornings withthe other ones.
16580,8,                                  CHAPTER 4The matter was solved for her.
16581,8,"The McKiscos were not yetthere and she had scarcely spread her peignoir when two men—the man with the jockey cap and the tall blonde man, givento sawing waiters in two-left the group and came dovm to-ward her."
16582,8,"  “Good morning,’' said Dick Diver."
16583,8,He broke down.
16584,8,"“Look-sunburn or no sunburn, why did you stay away yesterday? Weworried about you.”   She sat up and her happy little laugh welcomed their intru-sion."
16585,8,"  “We wondered,” Dick Diver said, “if you wouldn’t comeover this morning."
16586,8,"We go in, we take food and drink, so it’sa substantial invitation.”   He seemed kind and charming—his voice promised that hewould take care of her, and that a little later he would open upwhole new worlds for her, unroll an endless succession of mag-26                    I24                      TENDER IS THE NIGHTmficent possibilities."
16587,8,He managed the introduction so that hername wasn’t mentioned and then let her know easily thateveryone knew who she was but were respecting the complete-ness of her private life—a courtesy that Rosemary had not metwith save from professional people since her success.
16588,8,"   Nicole Diver, her brown back hanging from her pearls, waslooking through a recipe book for chicken Maryland."
16589,8,"She wasabout twenty-four, Rosemary guessed—her face could havebeen described in terms of conventional prettiness, but the ef-fect was that it had been made first on the heroic scale withstrong structure and marking, as if the features and vividnessof brow and coloring, everything we associate with tempera-ment and character had been molded with a Rodinesque in-tention, and then chiseled away in the direction of prettinessto a point where a single slip would have irreparably dimin-ished its force and quality."
16590,8,"With the mouth the sculptorhad taken desperate chances—it was the cupid’s bow of amagazine cover, yet it shared the distinction of the rest    ""Are you here for a long time?” Nicole asked."
16591,8,"Her voicewas low, almost harsh."
16592,8,   Suddenly Rosemary let the possibility enter her mind thatthey might stay another week.
16593,8,"   ""Not very long,” she answered vaguely."
16594,8,"""WeVe beenabroad a long time—we landed in Sicily in March and weVebeen slowly working our way north."
16595,8,"I got pneumonia makinga picture last January and IVe been recuperating.”    ""Mercy! How did that happen?”   ""Well, it was from swimming,” Rosemary was rather reluc-tant at embarking upon personal revelations."
16596,8,"""One day I hap-pened to have the grippe and didn’t know it, and they weretaking a scene where I dove into a canal in Venice."
16597,8,"It was avery expensive set, so I had to dive and dive and dive allmorning."
16598,8,"Mother had a doctor right there, but it was no use—got pneumonia.” She changed the subject determinedly be-fore they could speak."
16599,8,"""Do you like it here—this place?”   “They have to like it,” said Abe North slowly."
16600,8,"“They in-27                          TENDER IS THE NIGHT                            ^5vented it"""" He turned his noble head slowly so that his eyesrested with tenderness and affection on the two Divers,            did you?""    ""This is only the second season that the hotels been open insummer,"" Nicole explained."
16601,8,"""We persuaded Gausse to keepon a cook and a gargon and a chasseur—it paid its way andthis year it’s doing even better.""    ""But you’re not in the hotel.""    ""We built a house, up at Tarmes.""   ""The theory is,"" said Dick, arranging an umbrella to clipa square of sunlight off Rosemary’s shoulder, ""that aU thenorthern places, like Deauville, were picked out by Russiansand English who don’t mind the cold, while half of us Ameri-cans come from tropical climates—that’s why we’re beginningto come here.""   The young man of Latin aspect had been turning the pagesof The New York Herald."
16602,8,"  ""Well, what nationality are these people?"" he demanded,suddenly, and read with a slight French intonation, ""'Regis-tered at the Hotel Palace at Vevey are Mr."
16603,8,"Pandely Vlasco,Mme, Bonneasse’—I don’t exaggerate— Corinna Medonca,Mme."
16604,8,"Pasche, Seraphim TuUio, Maria Amalia Roto Mais, MoisesTeubel, Mme."
16605,8,"Paragons, Apostle Alexandre, Yolanda Yosfugluand Geneveva de Momusl’ She attracts me most—Genevevade Momus."
16606,8,"Almost worth running up to Vevey to take a lookat Geneveva de Momus.""   He stood up with sudden restlessness, stretching himself withone sharp movement."
16607,8,He was a few years younger than Diveror North.
16608,8,He was tall and his body was hard but oversparesave for the bunched force gathered in his shoulders and up-per arms.
16609,8,At first glance he seemed conventionally handsome—but there was a faint disgust always in his face which marredthe full fierce lustre of his brown eyes.
16610,8,"Yet one rememberedthem afterward, when one had forgotten the inability of themouth to endure boredom and the young forehead with itsfurrows of fretful and unprofitable pain.28iz6                      TENDER IS THE NIGHT    “We found some fine ones in the news of Americans lastweek/' said Nicole."
16611,8,“Mrs.

16613,8,S.
16614,8,"Flesh ” said Diver, getting up also."
16615,8,Hetook his rake and began to work seriously at getting smallstones out of the sand.
16616,8,"   “Oh, yes—S."
16617,8,"Flesh—doesn't he give you the creeps?""    It was quiet alone with Nicole—Rosemary found it even qui-eter than with her mother."
16618,8,"Abe North and Barban, the French-man, were talking about Morocco, and Nicole having copiedher recipe picked up a piece of sewing."
16619,8,"Rosemary examinedtheir appurtenances—four large parasols that made a canopyof shade, a portable bath house for dressing, a pneumaticrubber horse, new things that Rosemary had never seen, fromthe first burst of luxury manufacturing after the War, and prob-ably in the hands of the first of purchasers."
16620,8,"She had gatheredthat they were fashionable people, but though her mother hadbrought her up to beware such people as drones, she did notfeel that way here."
16621,8,"Even in their absolute immobility, com-plete as that of the morning, she felt a purpose, a workingover something, a direction, an act of creation different fromany she had known."
16622,8,"Her immature mind made no specula-tions upon the nature of their relation to each other, she wasonly concerned with their attitude toward herself—but sheperceived the web of some pleasant interrelation, which sheexpressed with the thought that they seemed to have a verygood time."
16623,8,"   She looked in turn at the three men, temporarily expropriat-ing them."
16624,8,"All three were persdhable in different ways; all wereof a special gentleness that she felt was part of their lives, pastand future, not circumstanced by events, not at all like thecompany manners of actors, and she detected also a far-reaching delicacy that was different from the rough and readygood fellowship of directors, who represented the intellectualsin her life."
16625,8,"Actors and directors—those were the only men shehad ever known, those and the heterogeneous, indistinguish-29                         TENDER IS THE NIGHTable mass of college boys, interested only in love at first sight,whom she had met at the Yale prom last fall."
16626,8,"  These three were different Barban was less civilized, moreskeptical and scoflSng, his manners were formal, even perfunc-tory."
16627,8,"Abe North had, under his shyness, a desperate humorthat amused but puzzled her."
16628,8,Her serious nature distrusted itsability to make a supreme impression on him.
16629,8,  But Dick Diver—he was aU complete there.
16630,8,Silently she ad-mired him.
16631,8,"His complexion was reddish and weather-burned,so was his short hair—a light growth of it rolled down his armsand hands."
16632,8,"His eyes were of a bright, hard blue."
16633,8,"His nose wassomewhat pointed and there was never any doubt at whomhe was looking or talking—and this is a flattering attention, forwho looks at us?—glances fall upon us, curious or disinterested,nothing more."
16634,8,"His voice, with some faint Irish melody run-ning through it, wooed the world, yet she felt the layer ofhardness in him, of self-control and of self-discipline, her ownvirtues."
16635,8,"Oh, she chose him, and Nicole, lifting her head sawher choose him, heard the little sigh at the fact that he wasalready possessed."
16636,8,"  Toward noon the McKiscos, Mrs."
16637,8,"Abrams, Mr."
16638,8,"Dumphry,and Signor Campion came on the beach."
16639,8,"They had broughta new umbrella that they set up with side glances toward theDivers, and crept under with satisfied expressions—all save Mr.McKisco, who remained derisively without."
16640,8,In his raking Dickhad passed near them and now he returned to the umbrellas.
16641,8,"  “The two young men are reading the Book of Etiquette to-gether,” he said in a low voice."
16642,8,"  “Planning to mix wit de quality,” said Abe."
16643,8,"  Mary North, the very tanned yoimg woman whom Rose-mary had encountered the first day on the raft, came in fromswimming and said with a smile that was a rakish gleam:   “So Mr."
16644,8,and Mrs.
16645,8,"Neverquiver have arrived.”   “They're this man's friends,” Nicole reminded her, indicatingAbe."
16646,8,"“Why doesn't he go and speak to them? Don't you thinkthey're attractive?”30— 28                      TENDER IS THE NIGHT    ""I thinlc they re very attractive ” Abe agreed."
16647,8,"""I just don’t think they’re attractive, that’s all.”    ^Well, I have felt there were too many people on the beach this summer,” Nicole admitted."
16648,8,"“Owr beach that Dick made out of a pebble pile.” She considered, and then lowered her voice out of the range of the trio of nannies who sat back under another umbrella."
16649,8,"*'Still, they’re preferable to those Brit- ish last summer who kept shouting about: Isn’t the sea blue? Isn’t the sky white? Isn’t little Nellie’s nose red?’”    Rosemary thought she would not like to have Nicole for an enemy."
16650,8,"   ^‘But you didn’t see the fight,” Nicole continued."
16651,8,"“The day before you came, the married man, the one with the namethat sounds like a substitute for gasoline or butter    “McKisco?”    “Yes—well they were having words and she tossed some sandin his face."
16652,8,So naturally he sat on top of her and rubbed herface in the sand.
16653,8,We were—electrified.
16654,8,"I wanted Dick to inter-fere.”    “I think,” said Dick Diver, staring down abstractedly atthe straw mat, “that I’ll go over and invite them to dinner ”    “No, you won’t,” Nicole told him quickly."
16655,8,   “I think it would be a very good thing.
16656,8,"They’re here-let’sadjust ourselves.”    “We’re very well adjusted,” she insisted, laughing."
16657,8,“I’m notgoing to have my nose rubbed in the sand.
16658,8,"I’m a mean, hardwoman,” she explained to Rosemary, and then raising hervoice, “Children, put on your bathing suits!”    Rosemary felt that this swim would become the typical oneof her life, the one that would always pop up in her memoryat the mention of swimming."
16659,8,"Simultaneously the whole partymoved toward the water, super-ready from the long, forcedinaction, passing from the heat to the cool with the gourman-dise of a tingling curry eaten with chilled white wine."
16660,8,"TheDivers’ day was spaced like the day of the older civilizationsto yield the utmost from the materials at hand, and to give31                    I                          TENDEK IS THE NIGHT                             2Qall the transitions their full value, and she did not know thatthere would be another transition presently from the utterabsorption of the swim to the garrulity of the Provengal lunchhour."
16661,8,"But again she had the sense that Dick was taking careof her, and she delighted in responding to the eventual move-ment as if it had been an order."
16662,8,   Nicole handed her husband the curious garment on whichshe had been working.
16663,8,He went into the dressing tent andinspired a commotion by appearing in a moment clad in trans-parent black lace drawers.
16664,8,Close inspection revealed that ac-tually they were lined with flesh-colored cloth.
16665,8,"   ""Well, if that isn’t a pansy’s trick!” exclaimed Mr."
16666,8,McKiscocontemptuously—then turning quickly to Mr.
16667,8,Dumphry andMr.
16668,8,"Campion, he added, ""Oh, I beg your pardon.”    Rosemary bubbled with delight at the trunks."
16669,8,"Her naiveteresponded whole-heartedly to the expensive simplicity of theDivers, unaware of its complexity and its lack of innocence,unaware that it was all a selection of quality rather than quan-tity from the run of the world’s bazaar; and that the simplicityof behavior also, the nursery-like peace and good will, the em-phasis on the simpler virtues, was part of a desperate bargainwith the gods and had been attained through struggles shecould not have guessed at."
16670,8,"At that moment the Divers repre-sented externally the exact furthermost evolution of a class, sothat most people seemed awkward beside them—in reality aqualitative change had already set in that was not at all ap-parent to Rosemary."
16671,8,"  She stood with them as they took sherry and ate crackers.Dick Diver looked at her with cold blue eyes; his kind, strongmouth said thoughtfully and deliberately:   ""You’re the only girl I’ve seen for a long time that actuallydid look like something blooming.”   In her mother’s lap afterward Rosemary cried and cried,   ""I love him, Mother."
16672,8,I’m desperately in love with him—32                          ”30                      TENDER IS THE NIGHTnever knew I could feel that way about anybody.
16673,8,And he^'smarried and I like her too—ifs just hopeless.
16674,8,"Oh, I love himso!’’    ‘Tm curious to meet him.”    ""‘She invited us to dinner Friday.”    “If you’re in love it ought to make you happy."
16675,8,You ought tolaugh.”    Rosemary looked up and gave a beautiful little shiver of herface and laughed.
16676,8,Her mother always had a great influence onher.
16677,8,                                  CHAPTER 5Rosemary went to Monte Carlo nearly as sulkily as it was pos-sible for her to be.
16678,8,"She rode up the rugged hill to La Turbie,to an old Gaumont lot in process of reconstruction, and asshe stood by the grilled entrance waiting for an answer to themessage on her card, she might have been looking into Holly-wood."
16679,8,"The bizarre debris of some recent picture, a decayedstreet scene in India, a great cardboard whale, a monstroustree bearing cherries large as basketballs, bloomed there byexotic dispensation, autochthonous as the pale amaranth, mi-mosa, cork oak or dwarfed pine."
16680,8,"There were a quick-lunchshack and two barnlike stages and everywhere about the lot,groups of waiting, hopeful, painted faces."
16681,8,   After ten minutes a young man with hair the color of canaryfeathers hurried down to the gate.
16682,8,"   “Come in, Miss Hoyt."
16683,8,Mr.
16684,8,"Brady’s on the set, but he’s veryanxious to see you."
16685,8,"I’m sorry you were kept waiting, but youknow some of —these French dames are worse about pushingthemselves in   The studio manager opened a small door in the blank wallof stage building and with sudden glad familiarity Rosemaryfollowed him into half darkness."
16686,8,"Here and there figuresspotted the twilight, turning up ashen faces to her like souls33                          TENDER IS THE NIGHT                            3Iin purgatory watching the passage of a mortal through."
16687,8,"Therewere whispers and soft voices and, apparently from afar, thegentle tremolo of a small organ."
16688,8,"Turning the comer made bysome flats, they came upon the white crackling glow of a stage,where a French actor—his shirt front, collar, and cuflFs tinted abrilliant pink—-and an American actress stood motionless faceto face."
16689,8,"They stared at each other with dogged eyes, as thoughthey had been in the same position for hours; and still for along time nothing happened, no one moved."
16690,8,"A bank of lightswent off with a savage hiss, went on again; the plaintive tapof a hammer begged admission to nowhere in the distance;a blue face appeared among the blinding lights above, calledsomething unintelligible into the upper blackness."
16691,8,Then thesilence was broken by a voice in front of Rosemary.
16692,8,"  ''Baby, you don't take off the stockings, you can spoil tenmore pairs."
16693,8,"That dress is fifteen pounds.”   Stepping backward the speaker ran against Rosemary,whereupon the studio manager said, ""Hey, Earl-Miss Hoyt.”   They were meeting for the first time."
16694,8,Brady was quick andstrenuous.
16695,8,"As he took her hand she saw him look her overfrom head to foot, a gesture she recognized and that madeher feel at home, but gave her always a faint feeling of superi-ority to whoever made it."
16696,8,If her person was property she couldexercise whatever advantage was inherent in its ownership.
16697,8,"  ""I thought you’d be along any day now,” Brady said, in avoice that was just a little too compelling for private life, andthat trailed with it a faintly defiant cockney accent."
16698,8,"""Have agood trip?”   ""Yes, but we’re glad to be going home.”   ""No-o-ol” he protested."
16699,8,"""Stay awhile—I want to talk toyou."
16700,8,Let me tell you that was some picture of yours—that'Daddy’s Girl.’ I saw it in Paris.
16701,8,"I wired the coast right awayto see if you were signed.”   ""I just had—I’m sorry.”   ""God, what a picturel”   Not wanting to smile in silly agreement Rosemary frowned.34 3^                      TENDER IS THE NIGHT     ""Nobody wants to be thought of forever for just one pic- ture ” she said."
16702,8,"    ""Sure—thafs right."
16703,8,"What re your plans?”     ""Mother thought I needed a rest."
16704,8,"When I get back we’ll probably either sign up with First National or keep on with Famous”    ""Who’s we?”     ""My mother."
16705,8,She decides business matters.
16706,8,"I couldn’t do without her.”    Again he looked her over completely, and, as he did, some- thing in Rosemary went out to him."
16707,8,"It was not liking, not at all the spontaneous admiration she had felt for the man on the beach this morning."
16708,8,It was a click.
16709,8,"He desired her and, so far as her virginal emotions went, she contemplated a surrender with equanimity."
16710,8,Yet she knew she would forget him half an hour after she left him—like an actor kissed in a picture.
16711,8,"   ""Where are you staying?” Brady asked."
16712,8,"""Oh, yes, at Gausse’s."
16713,8,"Well, my plans are made for this year, too, but that letter Iwrote you still stands."
16714,8,"Rather make a picture with you thanany girl since Connie Talmadge was a kid.”    ""I feel the same way."
16715,8,"Why don’t you come back to Holly-wood?”    ""I can’t stand the damn place."
16716,8,I’m fine here.
16717,8,"Wait till afterthis shot and I’U show you around.”    Walking onto the set he began to talk to the French actorin a low, quiet voice."
16718,8,"   Five minutes passed—Brady talked on, while from time totime the Frenchman shifted his feet and nodded."
16719,8,"Abruptly,Brady broke off, calling something to the lights that startledthem into a humming glare."
16720,8,Los Angeles was loud about Rose-mary now.
16721,8,"Unappalled she moved once more through the cityof thin partitions, wanting to be back there."
16722,8,But she did notwant to see Brady m the mood she sensed he would be inafter he had finished and she left the lot with a spell still uponher.
16723,8,The Mediterranean world was less silent now that sheknew the studio was there.
16724,8,She liked the people on the streets35                         TENDER IS THE NIGHT                             33and bongM herself a pair of espadrilles on the way to thetrain.
16725,8,"  Her mother was pleased that she had done so accuratelywhat she was told to do, but she still wanted to launch herout and away."
16726,8,Mrs.
16727,8,Speers was fresh in appearance but shewas tired; death beds make people tired indeed and she hadwatched beside a couple.
16728,8,"                                  CHAPTER 6Feeling good from the rosy wine at lunch, Nicole Diver foldedher arms high enough for the artificial camellia on hershoulder to touch her cheek, and went out into her lovelygrassless garden."
16729,8,"The garden was bounded on one side by thehouse, from which it flowed and into which it ran, on two sidesby the old village, and on the last by the cIi£E falling by ledgesto the sea."
16730,8,"  Along the walls on the village side all was dusty, the wrig-gling vines, the lemon and eucalyptus trees, the casual wheel-barrow, left only a moment since, but already grown into thepath, atrophied and faintly rotten."
16731,8,Nicole was invariably some-what surprised that by turning in the other direction past a bedof peonies she walked into an area so green and cool that theleaves and petals were curled with tender damp.
16732,8,  Knotted at her throat she wore a lilac scarf that even in theachromatic sunshine cast its color up to her face and downaround her moving feet in a lilac shadow.
16733,8,"Her face was hard,almost stem, save for the soft gleam of piteous doubt thatlooked from her green eyes."
16734,8,"Her once fair hair had darkened,but she was lovelier now at twenty-four than she had been ateighteen, when her hair was brighter than she."
16735,8,"  Following a walk marked by an intangible mist of bloomthat followed the white border stones she came to a spaceoverlooking the sea where there were lanterns asleep in the3634                      TENDER IS THE NIGHTfig trees and a big table and wicker chairs and a great marketumbrella from Sienna, all gathered about an enormous pine^the biggest tree in the garden."
16736,8,"She paused there a moment,looking absently at a growth of nasturtiums and iris tangled atits foot, as though sprung from a careless handful of seeds, lis-tening to the plaints and accusations of some nursery squabblein the house."
16737,8,"When tliis died away on the summer air, shewalked on, between kaleidoscopic peonies massed in pinkclouds, black and brown tulips and fragile mauve-stemmedroses, transparent like sugar flowers in a confectioner s win-dow—until, as if the scherzo of color could reach no furtherintensity, it broke off suddenly in mid-air, and moist steps wentdown to a level five feet below."
16738,8,   Here there was a well with the boarding around it dankand slippery even on the brightest days.
16739,8,"She went up the stairson the other side and into the vegetable garden; she walkedrather quickly; she liked to be active, though at times shegave an impression of repose that was at once static and evoc-ative."
16740,8,"This was because she knew few words and believed innone, and in the world she was rather silent, contributing justher share of urbane humor with a precision that approachedmeagreness."
16741,8,"But at the moment when strangers tended togrow uncomfortable in the presence of this economy she wouldseize the topic and rush off with it, feverishly surprised withherself—then bring it back and relinquish it abruptly, almosttimidly, like an obedient retriever, having been adequate andsomething more."
16742,8,"  As she stood in the fuzzy green light of the vegetable gar-den, Dick crossed the path ahead of her going to his workhouse."
16743,8,Nicole waited silently till he had passed; then she wenton through lines of prospective salads to a little menageriewhere pigeons and rabbits and a parrot made a medley ofinsolent noises at her.
16744,8,"Descending to another ledge she reacheda low, curved wall and looked down seven hundred feet tothe Mediterranean Sea."
16745,8,  She stood in the ancient hill village of Taimes.
16746,8,The villa and37                         TENDER IS THE NIGHT                             35its grounds were made out of a row of peasant dwellings thatabutted on the chflE—five small houses had been combined tomake the house and four destroyed to make the garden.
16747,8,Theexterior walls were untouched so that from the road far belowit was indistinguishable from the violet gray mass of the town.
16748,8,"  For a moment Nicole stood looking down at the Mediter-ranean but there was nothing to do with that, even with hertireless hands."
16749,8,Presently Dick came out of his one-room housecarrying a telescope and looked east toward Cannes.
16750,8,"In a mo-ment Nicole swam into his field of vision, whereupon he dis-appeared into his house and came out with a megaphone."
16751,8,Hehad many light mechanical devices.
16752,8,"  “Nicole,” he shouted, “I forgot to tell you that as a finalapostolic gesture I invited Mrs."
16753,8,"Abrams, the woman with thewhite hair.”   “I suspected it."
16754,8,"Ifs an outrage.”   The ease with which her reply reached him seemed tobelittle his megaphone, so she raised her voice and called, “Canyou hear me?”   “Yes.” He lowered the megaphone and then raised it stub-bornly."
16755,8,“I’m going to invite some more people too.
16756,8,"Tm goingto invite the two yoxmg men.”   “All right,” she agreed placidly."
16757,8,  “I want to give a really bad party.
16758,8,I mean it.
16759,8,I want to givea party where there’s a brawl and seductions and people goinghome with their feelings hurt and women passed out in thecabinet de toilette.
16760,8,"You wait and see.”   He went back into his house and Nicole saw that one ofhis most characteristic moods was upon him, the excitementthat swept everyone up into it and was inevitably followedby his own form of melancholy, which he never displayed butat which she guessed."
16761,8,"This excitement about things reachedan intensity out of proportion to their importance, generatinga really extraordinary virtuosity with people."
16762,8,"Save among a fewof the tough-minded and perennially suspicious, he had thepower of arousing a fascinated and uncritical love."
16763,8,The reac-3836                      TENDER IS THE NIGHTtioii came when he realized the waste and extravaganceinvolved.
16764,8,"He sometimes looked back with awe at the carni-vals of affection he had given, as a general might gaze upon a massacre he had ordered to satisfy an impersonal blood lust."
16765,8,"   But to be included in Dick Diver s world for a while was aremarkable experience: people believed he made special reser-vations about them, recognizing the proud uniqueness of their destinies, buried under the compromises of how many years.He won everyone quickly with an exquisite consideration anda politeness that moved so fast and intuitively that it couldbe examined only in its effect."
16766,8,"Then, without caution, lest thefirst bloom of the relation wither, he opened the gate to hisamusing world."
16767,8,"So long as they subscribed to it completely,their happiness was his preoccupation, but at the first flicker ofdoubt as to its all-inclusiveness he evaporated before their eyes,leaving little communicable memory of what he had said ordone."
16768,8,"   At eight-thirty that evening he came out to meet his firstguests, his coat carried rather ceremoniously, rather promis-ingly, in his hand, like a toreador’s cape."
16769,8,"It was characteristicthat after greeting Rosemary and her mother he waited forthem to speak first, as if to allow them the reassurance of theirown voices in new surroundings."
16770,8,"   To resume Rosemary’s point of view it should be said that,under the spell of the climb to Tarmes and the fresher air,she and her mother looked about appreciatively."
16771,8,"Just as thepersonal qualities of extraordinary people can make them-selves plain in an unaccustomed change of expression, so theintensely calculated perfection of Villa Diana transpired allat once through such minute failures as the chance apparitionof a maid in the background or the perversity of a cork."
16772,8,"Whilethe first guests arrived bringing with them the excitement ofthe night, the domestic activity of the day receded past themgently, symbolized by the Diver children and their governessstill at supper on the terrace."
16773,8,"  ""What a beautiful gardenl” Mrs."
16774,8,Speers exclaimed.39                         TENDER IS THE NIGHT                             37   ^'Nicole^’s garden/^ said Dick.
16775,8,"""She won’t let it alone—shenags it all the time, worries about its diseases."
16776,8,"Any day now Iexpect to have her come down with Powdery Mildew or FlySpeck, or Late Blight.” He pointed his forefinger decisively atRosemaiy, saying with a lightness seeming to conceal a pa-ternal interest, ""Fm going to save your reason—I’m going togive you a hat to wear on the beach.”   Pie turned them from the garden to the terrace, where hepoured a cocktail."
16777,8,"Earl Brady arrived, discovering Rosemarywith surprise."
16778,8,"His manner was softer than at the studio, as ifhis differentness had been put on at the gate, and Rosemary,comparing him instantly with Dick Diver, swung sharplytoward the latter."
16779,8,"In comparison Earl Brady seemed faintlygross, faintly ill-bred; once more, though, she felt an electricresponse to his person."
16780,8,  He spoke familiarly to the children who were getting upfrom their outdoor supper.
16781,8,"   ""Hello, Lanier, how about a song? Will you and Topsy singme a songF’    ""What shall we sing?” agreed the little boy, with the oddchanting accent of American children brought up in France."
16782,8,"  ""That song about *Mon Ami Pierrot.^”   Brother and sister stood side by side without self-conscious-ness and their voices soared sweet and shrill upon the eveningair."
16783,8,"                           “Au clair de la lune                                 Mon Ami Pierrot                              Prete-moi ta plume                                 Pour 6crire un mot                              Ma chandelle est morte                                 Je n""ai plus de feu                              Ouvre-moi ta porte                                 Pour Famour de Dieu.”    The singing ceased and the children, their faces aglow withthe late sunshine, stood smiling calmly at their success."
16784,8,Rose-403S                     TENDER IS THE NIGHTmary was thinking that the Villa Diana was the centre ofthe world.
16785,8,On such a stage some memorable thing was sureto happen.
16786,8,"She lighted up higher as the gate tinkled open andthe rest of the guests arrived in a body—the McKiscos, Mrs.Abrams, Mr."
16787,8,"Dumphry, and Mr."
16788,8,Campion came up to the ter-race.
16789,8,"   Rosemary had a sharp feeling of disappointment—she lookedquickly at Dick, as though to ask an explanation of this incon-gruous mingling."
16790,8,But there was nothing unusual in his expres-sion.
16791,8,He greeted his new guests with a proud bearing and anobvious deference to their infinite and unknown possibilities.She believed in him so much that presently she accepted therightness of the McKiscos' presence as if she had expected tomeet them all along.
16792,8,"   Tve met you in Paris,’’ McKisco said to Abe North, who withhis wife had arrived on their heels, ""in fact I’ve met you twice.*^    ""Yes, I remember,” Abe said."
16793,8,"  ""Then where was it?” demanded McKisco, not content tolet well enough alone."
16794,8,"  ""Why, I think—” Abe got tired of the game, ""I can t remem-ber.”   The interchange filled a pause and Rosemary’s instinct wasthat something tactful should be said by somebody, but Dickmade no attempt to break up the grouping formed by theselate arrivals, not even to disarm Mrs."
16795,8,McKisco of her air ofsupercilious amusement.
16796,8,He did not solve this social problembecause he knew it was not of importance at the moment andwould solve itself.
16797,8,"He was saving his newness for a larger effort,waiting a more significant moment for his guests to be con-scious of a good time."
16798,8,  Rosemary stood beside Tommy Barban—he was in a partic-ularly scornful mood and there seemed to be some specialstimulus working upon him.
16799,8,He was leaving in the morning.
16800,8,"  ""Going home?”   ""Home? I have no home."
16801,8,"I am going to a war.”   ""What war?”41                          TENDER IS THE NIGHT                            39   *What war? Any war."
16802,8,"I haven\ seen a paper lately but Isuppose there's a war—there always is.""   ‘‘Don't you care what you fight for?""   “Not at all—so long as Ym well treated."
16803,8,"When Tm in a rut Icome to see the Divers, because then I know that in a fewweeks 111 want to go to war.""   Rosemary stiffened."
16804,8,"  “You like the Divers,"" she reminded him."
16805,8,"  “Of course—especially her—but they make me want to go towar.""   She considered this, to no avail."
16806,8,The Divers made her wantto stay near them forever.
16807,8,"  “You're half American,"" she said, as if that should solve theproblem."
16808,8,"  “Also Im half French, and I was educated in England andsince I was eighteen I’ve worn the uniforms of eight countries.But I hope I did not give you the impression that 1 am not fondof the Divers—I am, especially of Nicole.""   “How could any one help it?"" she said simply."
16809,8,  She felt far from him.
16810,8,The undertone of his words repelledher and she withdrew her adoration for the Divers from theprofanity of his bitterness.
16811,8,"She was glad he was not next to herat dinner and she was still thinking of his words “especiallyher"" as they moved toward the table in the garden."
16812,8,"  For a moment now she was beside Dick Diver on the path.Alongside his hard, neat brightness everything faded into thesurety that he knew everything."
16813,8,"For a year, which was forever,she had had money and a certain celebrity and contact withthe celebrated, and these latter had presented themselvesmerely as powerful enlargements of the people with whom thedoctor s widow and her daughter had associated in a h6tel-pension in Paris."
16814,8,"Rosemary was a romantic and her career hadnot provided many satisfactory opportunities on that score.Her mother, with the idea of a career for Rosemary, wouldnot tolerate any such spurious substitutes as the excitationsavailable on aU sides, and indeed Rosemary was already4240                      TENDER IS THE NIGHTbeyond that—she was In the movies but not at all At them*So when she had seen approval of Dick Diver in her mother sface it meant that he was “the real thing”; it meant permissionto go as far as she could."
16815,8,"   “I was watching you ” he said, and she knew he meant it.""WeVe grown very fond of you.”    “I feE in love with you the first time I saw you,” she saidquietly."
16816,8,"   He pretended not to have heard, as if the compliment werepurely formal."
16817,8,"   “New friends,” he said, as if it were an important point, “canoften have a better time together than old friends.”    With that remark, which she did not understand precisely,she found herself at the table, picked out by slowly emerginglights against the dark dusk."
16818,8,A chord of delight struck insideher when she saw that Dick had taken her mother on his righthand; for herself she was between Luis Campion and Brady.
16819,8,"   Surcharged with her emotion she turned to Brady with theintention of confiding in him, but at her first mention of Dicka hard-boiled sparkle in his eyes gave her to understand thathe refused the fatherly oflSce."
16820,8,"In turn she was equally firmwhen he tried to monopolize her hand, so they talked shopor rather she listened while he talked shop, her polite eyesnever leaving his face, but her mind was so definitely else-where that she felt he must guess the fact."
16821,8,"Intermittently shecaught the gist of his sentences and supplied the rest from hersubconscious, as one picks up the striking of a clock in themiddle with only the rhythm of the first uncounted strokeslingering in the mmd."
16822,8,"                                  CHAPTER 7In a pause Rosemary looked away and up the table whereNicole sat between Tommy Barban and Abe North, herchow s hair foaming and frothing in the candlelight."
16823,8,"Rosemary43                             ”                          TENDER IS THE NIGHT                            4Ilistened, caught sharply by the rich clipped voice in infrequentspeech;   ""The poor man/’ Nicole exclaimed."
16824,8,"""Why did you want tosaw him in two?”   ""Naturally I wanted to see what was inside a waiter.Wouldn’t you like to know what was inside a waiter?”    ""Old menus ” suggested Nicole with a short laugh."
16825,8,"""Piecesof broken china and tips and pencil stubs.”   ""Exactly—but the thing was to prove it scientifically."
16826,8,"And ofcourse doing it with that musical saw would have eliminatedany sordidness,”   ""Did you intend to play the saw while you performed theoperation?” Tommy inquired."
16827,8,"  ""We didn’t get quite that far."
16828,8,We were alarmed by thescreams.

16830,8,"Not to have beenfriendly and interested would have seemed to reflect on theDivers, so now they were all trying, and seeing this, Rose-mary liked everyone—except McKisco, who had contrived tobe the unassimilated member of the party."
16831,8,This was less fromill will than from his determination to sustain with wine thegood spirits he had enjoyed on his arrival.
16832,8,"Lying back in hisplace between Earl Brady, to whom he had addressed severalwithering remarks about the movies, and Mrs."
16833,8,"Abrams, towhom he said nothing, he stared at Dick Diver with an expres-sion of devastating irony, the effect being occasionally inter-rupted by his attempts to engage Dick in a cater-comeredconversation across the table."
16834,8,"  ""Aren’t you a friend of Van Buren Denby?” he would say."
16835,8,"  ""I don’t believe I know him.”   ""I thought you were a friend of his,” he persisted irritably.4442                      TENDER IS THE NIGHT    When the subject of Mr."
16836,8,"Denby fell of its own weight, heessayed other equally irrelative themes, but each time the verydeference of Dicks attention seemed to paralyze him, andafter a moment’s stark pause the conversation that he hadinterrupted would go on without him."
16837,8,"He tried breaking intoother dialogues, but it was like continually shaking hands witha glove from which the hand had been withdrawn—so finally,with a resigned air of being among children, he devoted hisattention entirely to the champagne."
16838,8,"   Rosemary’s glance moved at intervals around the table,eager for the others’ enjoyment, as if they were her futurestepchildren."
16839,8,"A gracious table light, emanating from a bowlof spicy pinks, fell upon Mrs."
16840,8,"Abrams’ face, cooked to a turnin Veuve Cliquot, full of vigor, tolerance, adolescent good will;next to her sat Mr."
16841,8,"Royal Dumphry, his girl’s comeliness lessstartling in the pleasure world of evening."
16842,8,"Then Violet McKisco,whose prettiness had been piped to the surface of her, so thatshe ceased her struggle to make tangible to herself her shad-owy position as the wife of an arriviste who had not arrived."
16843,8,"   Then came Dick, with his arms full of the slack he hadtaken up from others, deeply merged in his own party."
16844,8,"  Then her mother, forever perfect."
16845,8,  Then Barban talking to her mother with an urbane fluencythat made Rosemary like him again.
16846,8,Then Nicole.
16847,8,Rosemarysaw her sudderJy in a new way and found her one of the mostbeautiful people she had ever known.
16848,8,"Her face, the face of asaint, a viking Madonna, shone through the faint motes thatsnowed across the candlelight, drew down its flush from thewine-colored lanterns in the pine."
16849,8,She was still as still.
16850,8,"   Abe North was talking to her about his moral code: ""Ofcourse I’ve got one,” he insisted, ""—a man can’t live withouta moral code."
16851,8,"Mine is that I’m against the burning of witches.Whenever they bum a Avitch I get all hot under the collar.”Rosemary knew from Brady that he was a musician whoafter a brilliant and precocious start had composed nothingfor seven years.45                          TENDER IS THE NIGHT                            43   Next was Campion, managing somehow to restrain his mostblatant effeminacy, and even to visit upon those near him acertain disinterested motherliness."
16852,8,Then Mary North with aface so merry that it was impossible not to smile back into thewhite mirrors of her teeth—the whole area around her partedlips was a lovely little circle of delight.
16853,8,"  Finally Brady, whose heartiness became, moment by mo-ment, a social thing instead of a crude assertion and reasser-tion of his own mental health, and his preservation of it bya detachment from the frailties of others."
16854,8,"  Rosemary, as dewy with belief as a child from one of Mrs,Burnett’s vicious tracts, had a conviction of homecoming, of areturn from the derisive and salacious improvisations of thefrontier."
16855,8,There were fireflies riding on the dark air and a dogbaying on some low and far-away ledge of the cliff.
16856,8,"The tableseemed to have risen a little toward the sky like a mechanicaldancing platform, giving the people around it a sense of beingalone with each other in the dark universe, nourished by itsonly food, warmed by its only lights."
16857,8,"And, as if a curioushushed laugh from Mrs."
16858,8,"McKisco were a signal that such adetachment from the world had been attained, the two Diversbegan suddenly to warm and glow and expand, as if to makeup to their guests, already so subtly assured of their impor-tance, so flattered with politeness, for anything they mightstill miss from that country well left behind."
16859,8,"Just for a momentthey seemed to speak to every one at the table, singly andtogether, assuring them of their friendliness, their affection.And for a moment the faces turned up toward them were likethe faces of poor children at a Christmas tree."
16860,8,"Then abruptlythe table broke up—the moment when the guests had beendaringly lifted above conviviality into the rarer atmosphereof sentiment, was over before it could be irreverently breathed,before they had half realized it was there."
16861,8,"  But the diffused magic of the hot sweet South had with-drawn into them—the soft-pawed night and the ghostly washof the Mediterranean far below—the magic left these things4644                      TENDER IS THE NIGHTand melted into the two Divers and became part of them.Rosemary watched Nicole pressing upon her mother a yellowevening bag she had admired, saying, '‘I think things oughtto belong to the people that like them"" —and then sweepinginto it all the yellow articles she could find, a pencil, a lipstick,a little note book, ""‘because they all go together/'    Nicole disappeared and presently Rosemary noticed thatDick was no longer there; the guests distributed themselvesin the garden or drifted in toward the terrace."
16862,8,"   ""‘Do you want,” Violet McKisco asked Rosemary, ""‘to go tothe bathroom?”    Not at that precise moment    “I want,” insisted Mrs."
16863,8,"McKisco, “to go to the bathroom.”As a frank outspoken woman she walked toward the house,dragging her secret after her, while Rosemary looked afterwith reprobation."
16864,8,"Earl Brady proposed that they walk downto the sea wall but she felt that this was her time to have ashare of Dick Diver when he reappeared, so she stalled, lis-tening to McKisco quarrel with Barban."
16865,8,   “Why do you want to fight the Soviets?” McKisco said.
16866,8,“Thegreatest experiment ever made by humanity? And the Riff?It seems to me it would be more heroic to fight on the justside.”    “How do you find out which it is?” asked Barban dryly.
16867,8,"   “Why—usually everybody intelligent knows.”    “Are you a Communist?”    “I'm a Socialist,” said McKisco, “I sympathize with Russia.”    “Well, I'm a soldier,” Barban answered pleasantly."
16868,8,“My busi-ness is to kill people.
16869,8,"I fought against the Riff because I am aEuropean, and I have fought the Communists because theywant to take my property from me.”    “Of all the narrow-minded excuses,” McKisco looked aroundto establish a derisive liaison with some one else, but withoutsuccess."
16870,8,"He had no idea what he was up against in Barban,neither of the simplicity of the other man's bag of ideas nor ofthe complexity of his training."
16871,8,"McKisco knew what ideas were,47                                    —                          TENDER IS THE NIGHT                            45and as his mind grew he was able to recognize and sort anincreasing number of them—but faced by a man whom he con-sidered ""‘dumb/' one in whom he found no ideas he couldrecognize as such, and yet to whom he could not feel per-sonally superior, he jumped at the conclusion that Barban wasthe end product of an archaic world, and as such, worthless.McKisco's contacts with the princely classes in America hadimpressed upon him their uncertain and fumbling snobbery,their delight in ignorance and their deliberate rudeness, alllifted from the English with no regard paid to factors thatmake English philistinism and rudeness purposeful, andapplied in a land where a little knowledge and civility buymore than they do anywhere else—an attitude which reachedits apogee in the ""Harvard manner ' of about 1900."
16872,8,"He thoughtthat this Barban was of that type, and being drunk rashlyforgot that he was in awe of him—this led up to the troublein which he presently found himself."
16873,8,"   Feeling vaguely ashamed for McKisco, Rosemary waited,placid but inwardly on fire, for Dick Diver's return."
16874,8,"From herchair at the deserted table with Barban, McEsco, and Abeshe looked up along the path edged with shadowy myrtle andfern to the stone terrace, and faUing in love with her mother sprofile against a lighted door, was about to go there whenMrs, McKisco came hurrying down from the house."
16875,8,  She exuded excitement.
16876,8,"In the very silence with which shepulled out a chair and sat down, her eyes staring, her mouthworking a little, they all recognized a person crop-full of news,and her husband’s ""What's the matter, Vi?” came naturally, asall eyes turned toward her."
16877,8,"  ""My dear—” she said at large, and then addressed Rosemary,""my dear—it’s nothing."
16878,8,"I really can’t say a word.”   ""You’re among friends,” said Abe."
16879,8,"  ""Well, upstairs I came upon a scene, my dears   Shaking her head cryptically she broke off just in time, forTommy arose and addressed her politely but sharply:   ""It’s inadvisable to comment on what goes on in this house.”48                    —                                   CHAPTER 8Violet bbeathed loud and hard once and with an effortbrought another expression into her face."
16880,8,  Dick came finally and with a sure instinct he separatedBarban and the McKiscos and became excessively ignorantand inquisitive about literature with McKisco—thus giving thelatter the moment of superiority which he required.
16881,8,"The othershelped him carry lamps up—who would not be pleased atcarrying lamps helpfully through the darkness? Rosemaryhelped, meanwhile responding patiently to Royal Dumphry’sinexhaustible curiosity about Hollywood."
16882,8,  Now—she was thinking—I’ve earned a time alone withhim.
16883,8,He must know that because his laws are like the lawsMother taught me.
16884,8,"   Rosemary was right—presently he detached her from thecompany on the terrace, and they were alone together, borneaway from the house toward the seaside wall with what wereless steps than irregularly spaced intervals through some ofwhich she was pulled, through others blown."
16885,8,  They looked out over the Mediterranean.
