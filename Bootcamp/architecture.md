## Definition: Evaluation Metrics 🎯

---

### Accuracy
- The proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined.
```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
```

---

### [Precision, Recall, F1](https://emkademy.com/research/toolbox/2020-03-02-accuracy-precision-recall) 🎯
- Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
- Recall (Sensitivity): The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class.
- F1 Score: The weighted average of Precision and Recall.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score
precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred)
```

### [AUC](https://paulvanderlaken.com/2019/08/16/roc-auc-precision-and-recall-visually-explained) 🎯
- Area Under the ROC Curve: A performance measurement for classification problem at various thresholds settings.
```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score
auc = roc_auc_score(y_true, y_score)
```

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CustomLoss(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, y_pred, y_true):
        loss = torch.mean((y_pred - y_true)**2)
        return loss

custom_loss = CustomLoss()
```
