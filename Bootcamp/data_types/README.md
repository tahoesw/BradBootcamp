(from a former bootcamper after I shared this)
Omg, this is exactly what we did in the bootcamp! Do you think Image classification would be good enough to show if I did apply not now of course but maybe like later on when I feel like I am confident in it or should I also do something they are looking for like spam detection, that sounds cool.... when Iâ€™m done with that I could definitely familiarize myself more with image classification because I feel like I know some stuff but I want to study more since I have more time now and become confident in what I know.
